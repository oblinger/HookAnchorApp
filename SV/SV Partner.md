Product Requirements

  
— exactly what stats and highlight would be of value to you

— what levels of accuracies would be required in order to supply its results to paying customers, and

— assuming our product met all of your requirements, and you had time to sufficiently test our product, then what do you imagine your usage ramp up might look like over say the next 6 or 9 months.

— what other requirements you might put on our product to make it viable for you?  For example how quickly would we need to return stat and highlight info once the game was on your server?
