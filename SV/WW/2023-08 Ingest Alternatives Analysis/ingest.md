### The Team Ask

A CALL TO ARMS

Mark and Jack have shouted alarm about this issue for some time...  It become clear the "detail" of effortlessly getting game video recorded and uploaded is anything but an "detail" for us!  Its not just a matter of getting bugs out of our code, this mission critical aspect of our business may well have no great answers, instead require us to piece together multiple pathways each with its own benefits and drawbacks.

So I would like everyone in the company to be a little aware of our progress in picking thru the alternatives in the coming weeks, and to put a little brain power into thinking about alternatives that we might be missing.  Please at least skim the ALL CAPS TOPIC SUMMARIES in this ingest channel as the come up.  Some of the questions I will be asking are technical in nature so perhaps it will be devs answering them.  But many of the questions are about how variants of consumer hardware and phone software works, so all in the company mights have insights or relevant experience.  All should feel very invited to contribute to these conversations!

PROBLEM FRAMING.
As a company I would love to first get thoughts on how we are framing the problem.  I have a short doc [[HERE]] that outlines the problem, and most specifically I am interested if I am missing any approaches we might take to the ingest problem.  Below is a graphic that depicts my organization of the space of all possible ingest approaches.  I tried to be as exhaustive as I could, to cover all cases, but what did I miss?  Get creative with it!  If we had an approach that avoid key drawbacks we might be willing to climb over mountains to get to it.

### Speeds

- Speed required for synchronous record and upload: 1000M / 60min =  0.2MB/sec

- Uploading to Google:  3 Mbytes/sec ~ 10min for 1gig.   3MB/sec * 10min * 60sec/min = 2.4G
	- 1000M in 10min = 1.6 MB/sec.   My computer reported 3.0 MB/sec, and SpeedTest reports 100 Mb/sec = 12.5 MB/sec
