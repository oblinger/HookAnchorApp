## PATENTS

- Use automated audiovisual detections of objects and people to detect events in sports games
	- STATS - To  generate statistics describing players, events, teams, clubs, leagues, games, tournaments, and seasons.
	- ANNOTATIONS - To generate annotations  (This would include jump balls, fouls, assists, rebounds, blocks, steals, errors, shots, made/miss, points, possession gain / loss, time out starts/stops, games start/end, serves, spikes, kicks, throws, hits, and tactics.)
	- DISCRIMINATE - to discriminate the actors in sports games. (This would include active players, shooters, assisters, rebounders, stealers, blockers, passers, receivers, foulers, referees, goalies, setters, servers, guards, etc.)  
	- IDENTIFY PLAYERS - to identify the players, referees, and non-players in sports games. (This would include player identification, referee identification, coach identification, other non-player identification.)  
	- CONTROL CAMERA - to control dynamic camera aiming and camera parameters to record and stream sports games. (This would include pan, tilt, rotate, zoom, focus, record on/off, blockage alert.)
	- SPEED ANNOTATION - to accelerate manual review, annotation, and corrections of annotations. (This would include using player identification cues, location cues, time cues, action cues, event cues, filtering and sorting of cues or confidences.)
	- CALIBRATE PANNING CAMERAS - to calibrate a panning camera, or multiple co-located cameras, to sports fields, courts, and venues. (This would include line detections, vanishing point detections, planar (floors/walls/backboards/nets) detections, ball detections.)
	- SYNCHRONIZE RECORDINGS - to synchronize multiple recordings. (This would include identifying the same sound or visual event captured by multiple sensors.)


1.		   Use automated audiovisual detections of objects, people, and events  in a sports game to generate statistics describing players, events, teams, clubs, leagues, games, tournaments, and seasons.  
2.      Use automated audiovisual detections of objects and people to detect events in sports games. (This would include jump balls, fouls, assists, rebounds, blocks, steals, errors, shots, made/miss, points, possession gain / loss, time out starts/stops, games start/end, serves, spikes, kicks, throws, hits, and tactics.)  
3.      Use automated audiovisual detections of objects, people, and events to discriminate the actors in sports games. (This would include active players, shooters, assisters, rebounders, stealers, blockers, passers, receivers, foulers, referees, goalies, setters, servers, guards, etc.)  
4.      Use automated audiovisual detections of objects and people to control dynamic camera aiming and camera parameters to record and stream sports games. (This would include pan, tilt, rotate, zoom, focus, record on/off, blockage alert.)  
5.      **???** - Use automated audiovisual detections of appearances, locations, and/or motions of objects and people to identify the players, referees, and non-players in sports games. (This would include player identification, referee identification, coach identification, other non-player identification.)  
6.      Use audiovisual information about the people, objects, and events in sports games to accelerate manual review, annotation, and corrections of annotations. (This would include using player identification cues, location cues, time cues, action cues, event cues, filtering and sorting of cues or confidences.)  
7.      Use automated detections of objects to calibrate a panning camera, or multiple co-located cameras, to sports fields, courts, and venues. (This would include line detections, vanishing point detections, planar (floors/walls/backboards/nets) detections, ball detections.)  
8.      Use automated audiovisual detections of objects and people to synchronize multiple recordings. (This would include identifying the same sound or visual event captured by multiple sensors.)

Watch Tower - we represent startups.
- many clients tech stars and other incubators.
- TWO PILLAR:
	1. File before launch -or- decide not to
	2. Product based patenting:
		- Need a to have a product that is better, faster, or XXX
		- One feature is unique to separate us from all others.

TWO MONTHS
- $7200 for month 1 - the search 
- $7200 on average - per patent.  
- $720/hour
- $30K per patent over 5 years, to get us to issuance
