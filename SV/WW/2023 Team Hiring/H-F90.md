6K/mo for senior flutter.

- 75% (full delegation) / 25% time 
  (close collab / delegate collab / peer sharing)

- low

- Moderate hours & High tempo



- Hiring: think thru propose deltas, 
	- interview backend person




Lets build complete - bullet point level plans for
- Week1, Week2, Week3  
- Month1, Month2, Month3
- Plan for how you will spend your time, and 
  what your tactical & strategic aims, and 
  how & when to get there (which steps when)

- No need to be verbose.. we can talk thru items
- But be complete, include get to know you calls etc.


Existing and soon team:

Concerns: (for each what should we do? what will you do?)
- TESTING
	- Our QA is not strong enough
	- Automation?  what/when
	- hiring approach/costs
- CODE
	- Our team's code quality is questionable.
	- knowns Junior, but lower cost.  good value?  enough?
- PRIORITIZATION
	- might be too much for you to guess at
- PLANNING
	- Mid-level planning
- FEATURE SPEC
	- Precision of features @ higher level UX
	- Creativity in working with product mgr


Thoughts on all else:
- SCRUMS
- JIRA Planning
- Higher planning
- testing
