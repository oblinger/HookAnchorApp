- [[2023 Clsh.TV Partnership]]


Adding Max (production) and Nathan (marketing).

[@Max Pasamonte](mailto:max@clsh.tv), can you send a sample multi-camera full game over.

What we’d like to see if we can do:

- Use SportsVisio for a scoring and stats “plug in/widget” to graphically and professionally present stats/score into our streams via AI as they livestream from the parks to the app

@nathan re clips (live highlights and recaps):

- We’re using Grabyo to take best moves from the game (manually) and move to a social person who manually posts (real time)
- We’re cutting the games into 2-3 minute “recaps” we try to get up ASAP (search for them drops post 24 hours)
- We do weekly and monthly “best ofs” that are manually edited, would love to get to AI-driven auto cuts like “best dunks of the week” etc.

Re-rev share, we could rev share on:

- Parent subs/PPVs/Microtrans on “my kid’s plays” (coming in Nov if possible)
- Social monetization/FAST of the clips
