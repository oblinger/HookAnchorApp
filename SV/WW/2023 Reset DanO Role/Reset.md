ASK
- Report to 
- Clarity that I do own AI output, and will ramp into detailed management of the with 
	- Mike will remain Chief Scientist 

R&R

OUR DESTINATION
- Jason owns Investors w support from Sam and Dan.
- VP-Eng owns Tactical SW Delivery.  Oversight by Dan or Jason.


BIG PICTURE OF OUR DESTINATION - We will be >$100M if we hit a all five of these functions, and will dead if we miss any one of them:
- J	  INVESTORS - We need to raise the funds required to execute.  (Jason owns, with Sam and Dan's support)
- J	  SALES - Long term differentiation will come from partnerships and customers; both are very very sticky!  (Jason oversees, with head of sales owner)
- D	  SOFTWARE - Stream of polished SW product produced by a high-functioning SW team. (Dan oversees, with VP-ENG owning tactical execution)
- D	  AI-STATS - Ability to execute, to fund raise, and produce novel value are all enabled by AI.  (Owned by Dan)
- S	  OPERATIONS - 


STRATEGIC ISSUES

SOFTWARE GAP 
- Perhaps part of our historically poor/slow execution is due to Jason wearing three critical hats and SW team not getting enough attention.
- Until we have a strong VP-ENG (which we cannot afford right now) SW will take large though decreasing oversight over time.

SOFTWARE OVERSIGHT will be a heavy lift until we get a strong VP of ENG. 






TACTICAL REALITIES

VP-ENG - We need a very capable VP-of-Eng who is not Dan (if you want any AI)
- B+	BUG TRACKING
- B-	WORK TRACKING
- C+	WORK (Sprint) PLANNING
- D	RELEASE COORDINATION
- F	QA & TESTING
- F	ESCALATION
- C+	SPRINT PLANNING 
- -	ROADMAPPING 


POTENTIAL TRAJECTORY
- Establish new reporting structure
  - On AI side make reporting chain strong; Tout virtues of Chief Scientist role that offloads operational responsibilities.
  - On SW side hold out possibility of VP-ENG role (but don't lie)
PHASE ONE 3-6 MONTHS
- SW Process establishment 3-6 months
	- Create & harden v1 processes 
- IMMEDIATE
	- Chain of command ownership of all key management levers: budget, hiring, roadmap
	- Dan manages with an extremely light touch: 
	  - Provide collaborative & deferential support 
	  - Bias towards passing what he proposes along with fewest edits possible
	  - Go out of my way to highlight his contributions & downplay mine to gain collaborative
- MONTHS 2-3
	- Take on some outward facing, evaulative, or operational outcomes



PROPOSED TRANSITION TRAJECTORY
- MAY - Release Cadence
- JUNE - Escalation Trees



GAPS
- OWNERSHIP - Fire in belly, up late ensuring it happen.

### 2023-04-21  discussion



~ Copied To ~ 

For SportsVisio to win it seems there are three big objectives that we need to meet:
(1) Raise the funds required to execute
(2) Deliver fully-automated AI-based sport stats
(3) Deliver a stream of polished SW products from high-functioning SW team


- If it is to deliver full AI stats, then I need to build a road map from where where are today to that goal, and it needs to be structured well so it leverages Mike if he stays and does not gap if he leaves.  BUT
	- I am not happy w/ our hiring process:
		- Vishal is the only non-Talent-cross person we have not fired.
		- TC loves interviewing w/ us because no test, just quick interview
		- On both sides we bring folks in for LONG time before firing
	- Not happy that we are running all our guys fully parallel because we are not sure who is able to deliver value.  (its a good tactical hack, but shows where we are at)
	- Roadmap might have Mike & I splitting technical responsibility:
	  e. g. maybe I would have him run a 'tracking' task force delivering player halos & while I coordinate others to deliver the balance of the
	  AI capabilities.
	  But it would be a UNIFIED vision & elbows would not be out as it is clear who owns responsibility for the outcome.


- You might say, No I prefer Dan owns the delivery high functioning products and SW team, and Mike owns delivery of autonomous AI as part of that team. Thus Dan needs to be ready if Mike leaves his role.
  But Dan's scope is delivery of the product as a whole:
	- But again not I am not in an ideal position to shape towards success of that larger role either:
	  Yesterday Scott half-delivered a few solutions for Mark that were not sufficient, but he did not test them well enough to ensure they were sufficient, so in the 11th hour we are scrambling to cobble alternatives.
	- If he reported into my org, I would be having a discussion with HIM about ownership today, but he's not my guy, and I don't own that delivery.


But presently I don't own the delivery of any of those things.
--> I have been nipping at the edges of things and providing tactical value anywhere I see great need.  We have some dumpster fires to that adds value, but 
- This does not put me on path to delivering fully autonomous AI stats, nor high-functioning products and high-functioning org.
- Worse I am not in the ideal position to be shaping things right now towards those deliverables.
- And this ambiguity harms efficient collaboration as elbows can be a good way to jockey for responsibility.
