Hi Dan,   
  
Great to hear that volleyball is on your radar.   
  
It's a great question in terms of MVP. Volleyball is a bit trickier as there are relevant events happening every few seconds without fail... e.g. surve, bump, set, spike, bump, set, spike, etc.  
  
Ideally we'd want the following events, although I'd want to loop our VP of Product in on this as she was the captain of the Harvard volleyball team back in the day. I really don't know volleyball that well as I've never played it, even after watching probably 1000s of matches in the last 5 years.  

- Serves
- Bumps / receptions
- Sets
- Spikes / attacks
- Blocks [nice to have]

The other tricky part about volleyball is that is can be filmed from the back and the side. Generally there is a preference for the back view for the purposes of coaching and recruiting, and parents who want to watch prefer the side panning view (e.g. when you watch an ESPN volleyball broadcast it is always from the side). We switched most of our filming to the side view a year ago.

  
We've found event detection in volleyball to be relatively straightforward (easier than basketball). Jersey number detection and assignment can be very difficult though. Ponytails are a big problem for jersey detection in volleyball.  
  
Ideally, we are targeting 2 hours or less for this. 4 hours may get it done as a proof of concept, but 8 is too long.  
  
#0 mvp isn't enough for us to do an integration. We actually have timestamps for every serve as use use that for our panning production. That is all done on device live. We just haven't had the time to build a product around cutting up the game around knowing.  
  
You are probably aware of an AI volleyball startup that does (0), (1), (2), and (3).

I suggest taking a look. The quality is ok, but it's still kind of cool. I like what they are building, and I suspect it will get better.  
  
Best,  
Aaron
