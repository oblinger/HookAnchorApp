Proposed Story for BallerTV
Full AI stats is a hard problem. 
- We have made strong progress of multiple sub-problems
- It seemed we were very close on full end-to-end stats
- We are further than expected on two key sub problems:
	- shot origination
	- player re-identification
- We expect to address both sub-problems but they are hard so we don't want to guess at how many weeks this will be, 
  and don't want to waste your time showing intermediate results,
  will keep you posted on progress
