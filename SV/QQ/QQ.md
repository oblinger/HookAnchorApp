### 2023-04-14  iOS consultant


- Hourly contract for a Senior iOS/Flutter dev for 2 weeks to 2months of full time work.

- Scope: 

Brian:
I am asking Tomas to give us a contract for an iOS consultant.

There flutter dev rates are something like 2x or 3x our current costs, so I am doubtful that we would ever rely significantly on them.
Still as an advanced team, it could be an interesting option to have at the ready.  I got him to agree to a 2week minimum, which I think is very much pushing there model into places they don't want to go.  I said that we would be flexible about start time if needed, and indicated an openness about support in the future depending on how our company grows.  Here is what I plan to send to him as soon as you thumbs up along with Jason.... it is the structure he and I discussed.


Tomas:
Here are some bullet points as discussed to frame and scope our contract:

- This would be an hourly contract for a senior iOS/Flutter developer.
- For at least 2 weeks (80 hours) of work up to 2 months (320 hours) of work.
- The scope of the work would be tasks as assigned and appropriate for the iOS / Flutter skillset of the developer.
- Our assumption is this work would focus initially on an iOS+threading bug which we have isolated into a stand alone app, but then could extend to other issues as indicated by the team.


80 * $75 = $6K
