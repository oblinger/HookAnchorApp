### 2023-05-04  WAR ROOM

WAR ROOM PROPOSAL

I am finding our combination of multiple slack channels and the many one-on-one messages that happens during normal company operations are not well suited for emergency situations like Cerebro.  And Cerebro is but the first in a long line of such emergencies that I feel we are not organized for.  Here are the problems I see with normal operations during an emergency, and below an idea I call the "War Room" as a special way that we operate once one of the four of us declare a war.  The Problems:

- SILOED DISCUSSIONS - Much time is wasted because key information is communicated outside of slack or inside of slack but in private communications.  Thus often a decision has been reached, or a new situation arises.  Like Scott is not done with XXX, but relevant people don't know this, and many communications end up being RETRANSMISSION of base information that has already been communicated one or many times in a siloed channel.

- MISMATCHED CHANNELS - Our present channels are pretty well matched to our present processes in 'peace times' but they don't fit very well when all of the sudden we are trying to jam QA discussions with Many Mangos into the stage acceptance channel, or James is putting bugs on Mark Lichty's spreadsheet into prod errors, or me putting a call to arms around scripting a tool for validating manual annotations into general.  The truth in all of these cases, none of the present channels are correct, and so info just be spread around to multiple wrong places.  (e.g. the script tools discussion was spread in Cerebro, general, and is multiple siloed invitation only group chats.  what a mess!)

- FLUID PLAYERS - Our teams are pretty well organized for business as usual. But on a war footing it is an all hands on deck kind of situation.  Often we find talent who can address a fast moving issue might come from anywhere in the company.  We posted to GENERAL for help because it was the only general place we could talk with the team.  That is fine, but it is totally the wrong place to gather team members to actually address a fast moving problem. 


THE WAR ROOM PROPOSAL

- DECLARING WAR -- I propose that Jason, Dan, Brian, or Jack can "declare" a war for the company.  The way I am thinking about it, the person who declares a war is the one who is most central in maintaining status and tempo so usually it would be Brian or Jack declaring the war, often at the behest of Jason.  And in many cases there will be multiple people ensuring tempo and maintaining status, but I think it is good to have a single belly button whose is the 'declarer' of the war and who has ultimate responsibility about tempo and status tracking.

- WAR ROOM SLACK CHANNEL -- The war room is a slack channel called "War Room" 
  
	- EMPTY BUT READY -- This public channel is know across the company, but is normally SILENT.  we never post there if a war is not on, that way when it lights up, everyone in the company knows to read what is there, before reading anything else.  The WAR-ROOM channel lighting up is a call to action for the whole company to at least look in and see if they are needed.
	  
	- MORE THREADING / LESS SILOING -- If I want to ask Scott if he has all the details needed to fix the re-frob-nocator then I would create a single message in the war room directly addressing @scott and ask what other stuff he needs.  THEN I can effectively invite others to that thread by simply referencing them in the reply to that one message.  The one lead message can become a small focused conversation about this topic, but importantly since it is in the war room, other people can see status and potenentially jump in with help.  WITHOUT ANY WASTED TIME REPEATING STATUS AMONG MANAGERS!!
	  
	- OTHER CHANNELS -- In war time this does become one more channel we must monitors.  That is definitely a negative, but I think it is worth it.  Here is my thinking:  We try to almost never have private update comms and favor the war room for such discussions, so there is ALOT of traffic in this channel very very messy.  far more info that we want in other channels.  But we still use other channels as we normally do so they maintain normal status but all the detailed discussions.  This does mean we need to monitor all of those channels, but that is ok for a war.
	  
- WAR ROOM DOC - Pinned to the top of the war room channel is a google doc called WAR ROOM.  The person who declared war will keep key status (or links to JIRA tickets, etc. with key status) at the top.  below that are some sections with relevant details or links to sub documents with relevant stuff.  I don't want to duplicate status that is already maintained elsewhere, so we can just use a URL link.  but often it is valuable to have a rollup summary status ... this where that could be written for all to see.  (we should probably put a timestamp on the status so the reader knows how stale it is.)

- Hourly contract for a Senior iOS/Flutter dev for 2 weeks to 2months of full time work.

- Scope: 

Brian:
I am asking Tomas to give us a contract for an iOS consultant.

There flutter dev rates are something like 2x or 3x our current costs, so I am doubtful that we would ever rely significantly on them.
Still as an advanced team, it could be an interesting option to have at the ready.  I got him to agree to a 2week minimum, which I think is very much pushing there model into places they don't want to go.  I said that we would be flexible about start time if needed, and indicated an openness about support in the future depending on how our company grows.  Here is what I plan to send to him as soon as you thumbs up along with Jason.... it is the structure he and I discussed.


Tomas:
Here are some bullet points as discussed to frame and scope our contract:

- This would be an hourly contract for a senior iOS/Flutter developer.
- For at least 2 weeks (80 hours) of work up to 2 months (320 hours) of work.
- The scope of the work would be tasks as assigned and appropriate for the iOS / Flutter skillset of the developer.
- Our assumption is this work would focus initially on an iOS+threading bug which we have isolated into a stand alone app, but then could extend to other issues as indicated by the team.
