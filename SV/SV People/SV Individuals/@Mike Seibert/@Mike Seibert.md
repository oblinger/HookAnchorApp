### 2023-04-03  Catchup call


#todo
- Joachim testing; get the doc


- locating and identifying play.  pretty good 


- what's keeping you up @ night?
- Jersey detect strategy
- Where are we at:  Hoop, Lines, Tracking, Shots
- Blocks/Assists/Minutes
	- 2 vs 3

~~ 
Topics:  
- anything you want to talk about...  
- the new guy  
- your strategic shift towards jersey detect (which I applaud)  
- any ways the rest of the org can accelerate CV progress  
- any things you want me in particular to be doing, or to be aware of, or monitoring?


- New guy is Maxim Dorogov. His resume was in the group I sent you.
- Jasu has done an amazing job integrating our new player location and ID plan into jira and confluence - all the info is there now.
- I'd be interested to see how to integrate Juaquin into our AI QA process when it's a good time for him.
- nothing in particular, and I appreciate you asking!



### 2023-03-06  Three guys CV guys from Argentina

(#1) Gonzalo
- He has one year of ML work.  and that was not even deep learning work.
- in Metrica Sports he did some un-named "CV research"
- I am pretty skeptaical, but would love to hear what he did.
  I watched their video, but did not see fancy AI CV stuff...
  maybe that stuff is still in R&D in 2023?!?!

not so impressed.


(#2) Matias
- I like Top Tal, it has some good (but sometimes expensive) devs
- I like IBM Research (but of course I am biased  ;-) )
- He was really only doing pipeline creation work
- XGboost is fine, but really old school ML, not what we need.
- NLP w/ bert is more end user ML, not developing the algs himself.
- Docker/Kubernettes is definitely a skill we could use and that seemed like he really did the work himself.  Still that is a narrow and time limited need that we have, and does not even need an ML/CV guy really for that.
- WORK AT IBM seems possibly interesting:
  Could not download his two papers, both seemed possibly interesting for us (maybe DL but not CV)  Transformer work is relevant and bert is not.
  - seems maybe capable of real algo development work.
- WORK AT WE VAT
  - "developed CV algos on tensor flow"   very very interesting if it was "real" algo work.
- WORK at MORSUM
	- some relevant dev-ops ML stuff, could be valuable if he really is a high velocity SW guy.
- I like that he founded his own company, motivation and broader perspective

Overall this guy seems like a legit possibility.
Mostly would want to understand what kind of DL algo stuff has he really done, AND do we think he is a high velocity executer.  if both of those were strong positives, then I would be pretty excited.


(#3) Gabriel
DATA SCIENTIST @ COE
- Technical leader running autoML.  Ugh.
- predicting oil pressure instabilities -- I have looked at this area... state of the art in this area is mostly using some silly regression model.  One *could* theoretically apply some interesting 3D modeling into a specialized ML alg, but you mostly dont' have the data to drive such fanciness, so I bet he did some old school generic ML on this.  (we can check, but I am skeptical).
- PySpark...  again generic ML tooling.
RESEARCHER AT CONICET
- 18 papers co-authored, but never tells us exactly what he did?!
- Self-propelled particles???
- the scope of tasks could have interesting models and algos, but I am skeptical since we are not told of a single alg or such developed (maybe there are too many to list?!)  we can ask, but I am quite skeptical.
POST DOC
- clear systems work, but feels more like a tools / platform and less algo work.
- "my own data science algos in Mat Lab"
  Can ask, but I bet it is old school ML-like stuff.

Doubtful this is a viable candidate, but cannot reject base on what we see here.




### m2023-03-01  Hiring AI / CV guys

- Linked In ad
- Stack overflow 
	- Open CV task, or PyTorch task






### 2023-02-17  AI Elements

### 2023-02-01  Intro 


- "nailing jello to a tree"
- Master class in soft skill execution
	- Reserachers feel empowered and self directed.
	- still making your reservations clear in a way that lets them know, you will be happy to be wrong
	- frequently soliciting consensus thinking and contructive focused discussion on issues
	- I bet you had very low attrition at Alphaworks & BAE


- I personally felt very invited to chime in with questions or thoughts during your meeting. 
	- I tend to be a shoot from the hip sort of fellow, it usually serves me well, but sometimes there are better ways and places.
	- Please just be super blunt with me if there are ever cases where I can better serve Sports Visio by operating in a different way PLEASE tell me!

- Getting deeper into the CV research & experiementation will be the most fun for me, and also most intellectually enriching too
  but if I go where I am most most immediately valuable I should support the larger SW/UX/QA ecosystem around the CV team first.


- Heart breaking customer churn.
	- QA is not robust enough to avoid regression bugs in a live system w frequent updates
	- UX is not driven systematically from those closest to the customers



- Lay of the land.  Our CV team is far more advanced than the structures around it to support it.
	- QA - seems we are using our precious users as first line testers for our tech
	- ANNOTATIONS - can I help build out a capacity to do one-of-a-kind annotations as a fast turn around scaled service for the CV team
	- UX DESIGN - Design flow - UX ideas from our front line guys are not making it down to product design choices at the detailed level
	- MGT TARGETS - upper mgt is asking for numbers that will cause gaming and unproductive hedging, padding etc. if they start pushing hard.
	- ASK - what support do feel the CV team and Sports Visio most need right now.
	- TICKET TRACKING - 
	- Definition of what the March product.  (product going to be:  
		- Pick product & date.  24/hr turn around of stats. just record the game. tripod score a person / team
		- Mid march - systems that goes; 
		- --> what is the ratio/


#to-do
- DEF of MARCH PRODUCT
- TICKET TRACKING 
- QA - 
- Onboarding - 

~~
ROTC - BA - MS - Air Force - 
- Risk - BU (MIT profs) - Lincoln labs - NN / 
- Joined Alpha Tech
	- Beta Tech (STR)
- Division Manager at BAE 120-130 people.  $30M/year
- three year vesting. 
- doing this for fun.
- making this stuff operational real.

DIFFERENTION
- Unlimited annotations (for practice games)
- Much more in depth




- Pulling teeth to get cloud factory to annotate


TO DO:
- Build a catalog of **edge cases**:
    (info gathered from hand annotation team)
    e.g. three different three-point lines.   lines for multiple courts on the floor.
	- Get this data from cloud factory.   Organize catalog of cases that don't fit.
- Build catalog of **Black swan events** 
	- someone made a basket for the other team 
	- two people with same color and same jersey number on the court
