- Very bad news:
	- Because sales only really happens at certain times of year for each sport, the board thinks we are not giving ourselves enough time to execute, and has asked us to cut our burn.

   - Jason mandated a cut across all departments.
   - I have looked at this 50-ways-to-tuesday the only solution I can see it to cut your hours down with the idea that you will move on.
   - I know the H1B is very important for your ability to get hired, so I want to try to help you still get that if we can.

- The driver here is the need to cut our burn under $200K/mo.
- $2K/mo 1/3 time.   or  1/2 time for 4 mo.



$6 * 12 = 72
4mo * 3 = 12
6mo * 2 = 12
