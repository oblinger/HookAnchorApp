### 2023-05-15  Change in Report To Structure

- Originally joined SV; idea was to have report to for all of SW.
  I think Jason wanted to get the measure of me first & best to move in slowly

- suggested to Jason last friday that now was the time to make this switch & he agreed.

- SHIFT 2 CV - The aim is to use this shift percentage of my time away from SW towards AI team.
  So over time I would progressively shift upwards in SW team 

- You have been wanting 2 come full time in SV.  I think this move slightly improves the chances for that.
- Was clear w/ Jason & Sam that we eventually need a VP-ENG and it should not be me.
- And SW group will always need a lead and obviously that role is also not me.

- Fact that Brian<>Dan working relationship is amazing from my perspective & I don't see this changing.
- Still 

### 2023-04-04  Push 2 Prod.

TOPICS:
- Scott rule
- P2P discussion
- 


Rule regarding production
  => Brian is *always* the decider
  => Brian is the decider, unless out of pocket, then Dan, then Scott.
