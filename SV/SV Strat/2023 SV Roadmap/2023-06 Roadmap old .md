SportsVisio 2023 Q2 Customer Acquisition Strategy

*Less is more*, we would rather deliver a high polish, low friction solution that serves ONE LARGE acquisition pathway, than multiple mediocre solutions for multiple pathways, as long as we have confidence that this one large pathway can completely saturate our ability to scale our execution throughout 2023.

The prime pathway we have chosen is centered on a ***tournament-based product introduction***, followed by a ***single-team centered stats***.  If the market does not react as we anticipate we may pivot from this strategy, still we have conviction about this strategy, and this strategy ALONE will expose many tens of thousands of potential customers to our best possible upsell contexts:

Customers has seen stats ***of their game*** in under ***3 minutes*** total setup time.

NOTE: we anticipate maintaining focus on the “prime pathway” thru at least end of April when we will assess it cost of customer acquisition relative to others we might consider.  During that time we will invest in secondary customer acquisition pathways, but only when the dev in question is not able to efficiently contribute to our prime pathway, or the prime pathway is functioning solidly.

## 

## Virtues of this “prime pathway”

- It is a SINGLE pathway, so we can rapidly iterate and optimize our UX, app & process.
- It can put us in front of many tens of thousands of potential customers.
- It does not depend upon us have an existing customer base.
- It does not depend upon customers have heard anything positive about us, or even heard of us.
- It alone appears to be able to drive far more customer growth than we can handle in 2023.
- This strategy appears to be able to drive far more customer growth than we can in 2023 so it makes sense to go “all in” on this strategy until we have solidly conquered it, before expanding our approaches.

## Con of this “primary pathway”

- This pathway could become too costly per new account to scale fully. Still we have several powerful ways to mitigate these costs, so it is possible we can afford to drive it fully.

# “Prime Pathway” Strategy Summary

SportsVisio setups up a scaled ***tournament-based product introduction*** capacity where we provide the SportsVisio stats experience for all players, all parents, and all coaches at AAU tournaments that we support.  Over time we grow our capacity to cheaply introduce our product to many tens of thousands of potential customers with hardware provided onsite for customers to convert immediately after seeing our capacity.

A second follow up capacity is centered ***single team centered stats*** servicing.  This second capacity is focused on providing stats to a single paying team as they play a range of other teams that likely are not using SportsVisio or are entered into our system.

NOTE:  We certainly envision using our tournament introduction capacity to feed our single team servicing capacity, there will likely be other methods of getting coaches/players excited enough to try out our single team centered stats, so we will want to make minimal assumptions about what got a customer to try out or pay for this service.

### Secondary Strategies

There are MANY secondary strategies that will also be important in 2023, still we want to be very clear that this “prime pathway” is our current best guess and focus for customer acquisition.  We want to achieve robustness and ability to scale this strategy as fast as possible, so we should not be expending resources beyond this strategy unless that resource cannot be effectively used to make progress on this strategy.  The prime pathway is primary.

**Important secondary strategies include:**

- **Viral Propagation Strategies** that drive adoption of SportsVisio through social media sharing, or other vectors that use Present day usage to drive future customer conversions.
- **Specialized single Client Strategies** that support access to a single large customers or partner that can provide access to multiple customers, can clearly become very important since they can drive early adoption.
- **Tournament-Based Secondary Sales Strategies** may become very interesting for us both because that can reduce the cost over servicing each tournament, so we can greatly expand the number of tournaments we are servicing, and because they drive top line revenue which is a key metric important in fundraising. (Examples include selling Player Highlight Reels as recorded from a single tournament and shared to social media)
- **Cost Reduction Strategies** that help enable us to provide stats for a lower total cost per game (thru AI, UX, and process improvements). Driving these reductions will be critical for product differentiation from fully manual competitors, for fund raising, and to allow us to scale our primary pathway as well.
- **Gamification Strategies –** may play an important role in improving stickiness, app usage, and viral adoption, thus as resources allow, we will explore experiments in this.
- **Sponsor Inducement Strategies** – might be essential in getting SportsVisio into markets where event sponsors or other gatekeepers control access to potential customers. In such markets supporting inducement could be critical; inducements could include water mark branding, video access, access to SportsVisio collected contact info, and various shared revenue models.

# Justification for our present choice of “prime pathway”

Background:

SportsVisio does not yet have a strong brand presence and it does not have an existing customer base to build from.  Further obtaining stats automatically from an App is not yet an experience familiar to most in this market.  Thus, gaining sufficient trust from a potential customer to get them to spend the time, hassle, and money required to test out the SportsVisio app may be a significant impediment to scaled adoption.

The tournament setting provides a unique opportunity approach for vaulting over these impediments.  SportsVisio can arrange for the account registration, data entry, game recording, and hardware required to provide potential customers with stats and highlights recorded for their game.  Having seen this value recorded in front of their eyes, and provided for their own game minutes is probably going to be a best possible “upsell opportunity” for SportsVisio.  Thus, we current plan to use this as the primary driver for early customer adoption in 2023.  We do plan to move beyond “prime pathway” approach, but only after we have solidly addressed and are effectively capitalizing on this avenue for customer acquisition.

Approach:

1. **AGREEMENT** – Mark will get agreement from a sequence of tournament organizers to allow us to record at their venue and provide some amount of stats recording at their event.  TBD: which tournaments sizes and types will convert the best? Can we find organizers that will allow us to record with minimal or no inducements for them? 
2. **DATA ENTRY** – SportsVisio’s ops team manually captures and enters team-level data in for each team at each upcoming tournament.  TBD: I am hoping we can arrange for some offshore support for the ops team. The fallback would be members of our core team, but this is far from ideal.
3. **SIGNUP** – At the event we have a large poster board telling folks how to sign up to see SportsVisio stats in action. We tell them to create their own user account using their own email address in order to gain access.   TBD: We need to optimize our signup processes as required above to be so self-explanatory that most potential customers can successfully sign up using nothing more than the display poster w/o any further instruction. (we should test this ASAP.)
4. ** TBD:** The poster board has the name of the tournament and a code which is enough to find your team to complete signup. 
5. **LAST WEEKS GAME** – Immediately upon signing in they will see some pre-recorded games that have been pre-added to this tournament, which were recorded prior to the tournament. This ensures that we have captured their email address, and will be ready to push their own game stats to them when they are available.   TBD: This will require that the ops team to manually inject these sample games into each tournament team roster so that stats can be viewed immediately, and we are sure to capture emails right from the start. 
6. **RECORDING** – The day of the tournament a SportsVisio intern sets up cameras on each one of the courts and triggers recording at the start of each game, selecting the appropriate teams from those included during our data entry step.
    1. **HARDWARE** – The intern will need to have enough phones and mounts to record on all courts.
    2. **SPECIAL HANLDING** – For larger tournaments the attendant may miss the end times for a game in which case the camera will continue rolling, and the offshore team will need to split multiple games from a single recording, and/or provide team assignments in the case that the intern was unable to capture the data as they began recording.
7. **PROCESSING** – Until we have sufficient automation the ops team will need to manage the flow of data and notifications to process and email about data in a timely fashion.
8. **EMAIL NOTIFICATION** – At the event on the second day folks will be notified by email and/or text that their game stats are in and they should go view them in their app.
9. **UPSELL** – At the event we have a stack of hardware kits for purchase. $25 for a 2-camera setup and $100 for a pivo setup. They can also get $50 off a full season’s worth of game recordings if they purchase now.
    1. **PURCHASING** – Until automation has been put into place we will simply be accepting purchase via HubSpot and our ops team will be managing tracking of whether users have purchased sufficient recordings credits.
10. **SINGLE-TEAM CENTERED STATS –** Regardless of which upsell option a customer has selected they are now in position to transition into our single team centered stats flow.
