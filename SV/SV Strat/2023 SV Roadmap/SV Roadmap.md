Explanation:

- This framework formalizes assumptions underlying Jason's vision right from the inception of the company.
- It is a stupid simple skeleton with four slots that one can plug thousands of different strategy combinations into.
- In one sense folks might roll their eyes and say "of course what it all the fuss here!"
- The value is in being explicit and writing down the criteria for each of these parts so we can have a discussion about slot A is better filled with option 1, 2 or 3.  We might pivot from option 1 to option 2, but it encourages us to not do option 1 AND option 2.
- Also by spelling out the true objective for each of these four slots we can ask ourselves to think really hard about the question:
  "Is what I am proposing right now the ABSOLUTELY SIMPLEST / MOST LIKELY way" to achieve this slot's objective.  If it is not, then we should think really really hard about why we are not doing the simplest one first.
- Keeps us focused on the forest while selected the best looking tree to cut next.  These four slots get as all the way to our ultimate goal of sustained market value.  Thinking about all four of these slots while making our choice for the next step on each slot is essential so we don't make choices that look good locally but are not globally part of a single good path.


CAVEAT #1: 
Not all work that we must do will fit into this framework.  Raising money, for example, is so important we must do things off path if they will really help.  Still there should be flashing warning signs attached to any work that is off path, and we should have time & money limits for such detours.  We must NOT think "oh well eventually we will need to XXXX, thus we might as well do it now."  No, no, no!  As future 100M dollar company there are many many things we will eventually do, but if we attempt to do them all now, we will not be the next big thing, we will be a smoking hole in the ground.

Each time we do something that does not properly fit as the *NEXT* logical *MINIMAL* step inside our framework it should PAIN US.  We should wring our hand and ask: could we delay that other thing a little longer, or maybe just do some cheap hack instead?  Or perhaps we can somehow alter that thing, or alter our four slot frameworks, so that other thing BECAME on our main path? The genius of execution is creatively shaping the parts so one can reuse effort to serve multiple ends. 

We want to highlight the main path in glowing neon lights, so every other action is rightfully seen as the company slow down that it is.
Today I think we are not sufficiently clear on what the main path IS, thus we are not sufficiently pained when we are off of it.


CAVEAT #2:
Getting clear on our framework and roadmap does not solve all or even most of our problems today.
But does have real value, so if we can agree on it.  Then lets do that!



### Example Application of the Framework

So what?  Nice framework dan, good to see you like typing long documents, but what do you ** DO ** with this framework?

1. FLESH OUT THE FRAMEWORK -- This is an art not a science.  Lots of the details of the framework need to be fleshed out and questions. 
   Are the metrics right?  Did we list the key decision criteria?  When they conflict with each other, which should dominate, etc.?
   
2. CREATE SOME PROPOSALS -- Then we need to propose detailed proposals for different slot fillers four our four slots.  This takes energy and attention to detail as each proposal needs to explain how it might fit with other choices made for the other three slots so it could be part of a globally consistent strategy.

3. DUKE IT OUT! -- Once we have multiple leading candidates for a give slot, we want to figure out a reasoned way to rule one of them out as clearly inferior to some other choice, either because it has some achilles heel, or because one is easier or more certain than the other.

4. SIMPLIFY -- Each of the slot objectives are intentionally written as single line in order to focus on the core of the objective.  Look at all the parts of your proposal.  Really is there no way to achieve the core of the objective in a smaller early way sooner?  If so, then replace your proposal with the simpler one, and achieve that one first.

5. OUT OF BOUNDS -- Great, now we have our narrow path.  So everything not on this path is a DETOUR!  Maybe its a needed one, but it should be questioned ... hard.



Here is one far too quick and dirty first stab at using the framework.  There are many other interpretations of the same framework, so I am DEFINITELY not trying to claim this quick stab is the right direction!!


Possible Analysis Outcome:  Do Loved-1 and Automation-2 everything else is a detour.


## Slot 1 - LOVED

**LOVED OPTION #1 -- The passionate AAU parent with an Android phone**
- We almost have workable hoops app.
- If a parent was really passionate they could upload with the gallery and could use a two camera setup.
issues
- Needs an effective game creation flow
- Might require significant 'passion' to use gallery and two phones???  (would it?)
- Cannot support the 'detour' requirement of AAR since we cannot easily scale this w/o viral adoption or such


**LOVED OPTION #2 -- The Men's League Gym with fixed camera setup**
- Does not require as much passion from the center
- Supports modest ARR
issues
- Requires fixed camera solution to really work (this is new, will take notable effort to iron out, and modest risk of being unworkable)
- Is not as 'on path' as AAU parent if our domination target is AAU


**LOVED OPTION #3 -- High School coaches too cheap to buy Hudl**
- Supports moderate ARR
issues
- Need to react FAST to maximize ARR as purchasing will be in narrow window
- Pain points will be notably different than our AAU target customer as pattern with other teams, pattern of recording etc are different.
- Need to map out details of usage pattern fast so product has all the small features working ASAP
- Need to have some coaches loving this product early both as proof points to drive sales, AND
  because we have never had ANY customer love this product, we should treat this goal is risky.



## Slot 2 - ADOPTION

ADOPTION.
No action.  Can't test adoption until we have a lovable product.



## Slot 3 - AUTOMATION

AUTOMATION #1 - HOVERING PLAYER NUMBERS

AUTOMATION #2 - BALLER-TV













### THE SV ROADMAP FOR OUR FIRST INDUSTRY DOMINATION

**Objective**: Provide a skeletal roadmap that can be used to which specific tasks would, and most importantly would not fit into our overall plan for achieving sustained value.  Importantly, this skeleton does not contain ALL important task, like having short term results needed to drive fund raising etc.  The skeleton is spelled out so we keep focus on larger plan and to allow us to look specifically for synergies where we can achieve our short term objectives in ways that simultaneously maximize progress on this larger plan.

Our larger plan in broken into four sub-objectives:
1. **LOVED** - Produce a stats-related product A player/coach loved stats product.
2. **ADOPTED** - A strong fly-wheel with proven ability to drive adoption at scale.
3. **AUTOMATED** - Full-AI providing "adoptable value" at market-disruptive pricing.
4. **DOMINATION** - Dominate cohesive, sticky market network effects.

### Core Assumptions
- Fully automated AI-based basketball stats will be dramatically cheaper than existing alternatives. 
- This pricing will open new markets and disrupt price sensitive segments of existing markets. 
- Within 3-5 years fully automated Basketball stats will become commonplace, sparking a race to the bottom for products based on these stats.
- Price insensitive premium markets will continue to exist, but newly disrupted price sensitive markets will ride this price curve downward.
- Thus long term value can only be obtained by 
    - tipping price sensitive and new markets into a full-AI product offering during this 3-5 year window
    - and retaining market leadership via some combination of network effects as Hudl does today

The business strategy skeleton below is organized around these assumptions.  Each of its parts can be swapped out for alternatives that serve the same purpose.  Ultimate market domination requires finding at least one suitable filler for each slot below.  Both intermediate investment money AND ultimate market domination are heavily dependent upon being among the first to achieve each milestone below.  Thus our focus should be in finding the first and easiest element for each part of the skeleton below.  Once the basic skeleton is filled in we can go back and add second and third alternatives for each element, but we dare not slow down to achieve such duplication before completing the whole structure.  Neither the market nor the investors will reward such delays, given the race that will soon be underway, trading time for duplication will rarely be rewarded.

## .

## LOVED

**Objective**: Produce a consumer Basketball stats product that is deeply loved by its users.

**Reasoning**: Having a consumer product appears to be key for our domination objective; building such products with the right features, right UX, and right polished interface is a difficult dark art, with many dead ends before a great path is found.  Thus it is critical that we are focused on achieving this "loved" goal a most central task early in our journey.

**Framing**: A solution for the "loved" objective should specify:
- CENTER - The person who will logistically manage system setup and game capture, etc.
- SEGMENT - The consumer user segment who will be validated as loving the product
- FEATURES - The core features this product will provide to these consumers

**Top Targets**:
1. PASSIONATE PARENT - Certain passionate parents of a AAU league players will put up with a lot of pain from a buggy app, and will have the enthusiasm to give us detailed feedback.  They will also be among the most able to rally their team to start paying break-even costs for the annotations we are providing to them.  Further they are well aligned with our domination AAU target.
   CENTER: A single parent.  SEGMENT:  AAU basket ball players.  PRODUCT:  Per player stats and highlights. 
2. TOURNAMENT PROVIDER - An enthused AAU tournament provider could support usage of our app across all of their tournaments. 
   This would give us feedback from a large number of players that attend their tournaments each week.
   CENTER: A tournament owner or a gym owner. SEGMENT: AAU basket ball players.  PRODUCT:  Per player stats and highlights. 
3. MENS LEAGUE - Men's leagues typically play repeatedly within the same gym; many teams typically play at a single gym; and each player is typically investing a noticeable sum of money each season.  This admits the possibility of a MVP that requires less effort from the 'CENTER' as well as other unique advantages.
   CENTER: The gym owner.  SEGMENT: Men's League Players.  PRODUCT:  Per player stats and highlights.
4. HIGH SCHOOL

**Decision Criteria**: Our choice of target should:
  - Have a rich and promising space of potential adoption strategies
  - Be a good target segment for domination 
  - Require as little time and money to develop and test our first MVP
  - Good opportunities for MVP

**Metric For Measuring Success**:
- USABILITY - Initially our target is to simply build a system that works well enough and is usable enough for our target customers to use it, and keep using it.  Initially we don't need a formal metric, churn is more than sufficient.  Mostly we just need to fix the bugs that are killing its continued usage, and fix the parts of the user experience that are so bad it makes it impractical to use.
- TBD - As the system achieves basic usability we should probably employ a range of metrics for churn, usage density, and formal surveys to assess how well we are doing in building a loved product.

**Current Activity**:
- Should choose a SINGLE best top target and should be serving them repeatedly and daily as best we can TODAY!
  (We can serve a second target too, but we must acknowledge the second target as a detour to satisfying this objective.)


Note: This objective is not about scale, it is about daily feedback and product feature iteration.


## .

## ADOPTION

**Objective**: Develop, deploy, and validate as scalable method for customer product adoption.

**Reasoning**:  Following Jason's focus on CAC2LTV we need to identify strategies to for acquiring customers that both scales and is cost effective.  Again this is a dark art which requires many dead ends before a solution is found, thus developing a rapid experimentation is essential.

**Framing**:  The adoption objective is framed as a sequences of experiments where we are attempting to identify and validate a scalable method of cost-effectively acquiring non-churning customers at scale.  Each experiment is framed by specifying:
- ADOPTION STRATEGY - The adoption approach being tested.
- EXPERIMENT - The specific experiment we are running to test the adoption strategy.
- MIN OUTCOME - The minimal threshold below which we must reconsider if the strategy is worth of further consideration.
- EXPECTED OUTCOME - Money where your mouth is best guess about the outcome.  (just to train our 'guessing' skills)

ADOPTION STRATEGY
- SEGMENT - A specification of the collection of individuals that are targeted by this adoption strategy.
- BUYER - In the case that the buyer is distinct from the targt
- PRODUCT - A specification of the product being sold.
- APPROACH - The mechanism used to gain visibility and ultimate adoption of the product.
- COST - An estimate of the per-customer cost for the 

EXPERIMENT
- SETUP - Where does the experiment happen?  Who is involved?  What happens? etc.
- SCALE - How many locations/people etc. are involved in this experiment?  (We might stop early if results suck)
- METRIC(S) - What are we measuring for this experiment?  Ideally we have a single key 'outcome' metric, but can also measure many other things too.


**Top Targets**:
1. TOURNAMA-TEAMER - In this adoption strategy we provide a modest enticement for tournament providers to allow us to record tournament games at scale every weekend.  Costs are covered by modest $0-$5 pricing for sharable per-player highlights and player clips sold via QR-code advertising placements at the tournament.  Strategy relies on subsequent marketing to captured accounts for per-team full season stats product.
2. SOCIAL-VIRALIZER - Combination of social media placement and highlight clip water-marking etc. is used to drive interest and ultimately team adoption of Sports Visio stats and highlights in an ever expanding circle of users within and beyond our core market.
3. MANY MANY MORE - Jason, Mark, and Jack could (and should) fill a small book with many many ideas here...  and once we have a loved system, we should be testing as many as we can.


**Target Decision Criteria**:
We will be selecting many of these experiments
- How much time, effort, and money is require by the experiment
- How likely do we think it is 'on path' to a solid adoption strategy
- How much information is gain from the outcome of the experiment


**Metric For Measuring Velocity**:
- *TESTS PER QUARTER* - For each test we explicitly frame some hypothesis about how some particular market segment will react to some particular adoption strategy along with two provided thresholds a minimal level worthy of continued exploration and our best guess outcome.  Then we measure the response obtained.
**Metric For Measuring Success**:
- TBD - Probably some combination of LTV/CAC, plus some adoption grow curve coefficient.


**Current Activity**:
- None.  We need a stable product of sufficient quality that we can charge for it.  But THEN one or more adoption experiments can begin.


## .

## AUTOMATION

**Objective**: Develop "Full AI" video processing for basketball stats that provides "adoptable value" at market-disruptive pricing.

**Reasoning**: Ultimately we believe that network effects will allow segment leaders to maintain their dominant positioning, thus providing them with sustained differentiation.  But GETTING to be that dominant player will require more than simply having strong adoption techniques.  Those techniques can and will be duplicated, thus one needs to have abilities that CANNOT be duplicated for a period of time in order to achieve market domination.  After that point network effects are used to retain the gains found.  We believe that full-AI is the near term differentiation that will allow us to dominate the market in a way that (for a period of time cannot be replicated).

According to this logic then, it is critical that the market we are attempting to dominate is price sensitive in a way that allows full-AI to address their needs in ways others cannot, OR requires features like real-time stats which cannot be obtained without full-AI.


**Framing**: The automation objective is framed as a product offering having a specified list of key features that of value to some targeted segment at a targeted price.  Thus it is specified by listing:
- KEY FEATURES - A list of differentiating features for the offering
- TARGETED SEGMENT - The *initial* market segment these features are targeted for.
- TARGETED PRICE - A price that Full-AI can achieve which is also very attractive for our targeted segment.


**Top Targets**:
1. BALLER_TV++ - National accounts that require "highlights worthy" game-event detection (e. g. player shots).  Baller TV is one of likely a few organizations willing to pay for fully automated AI analysis at lower accuracy levels.


**Target Choice Decision Criteria**:
- 

**Metric For Measuring Success**: TBD.  It is likely that we will measure the adoption rate for the product given among those exposed to the product via marketing, free trial etc.  The expectation is that we will invest heavily in developing several core features, and then iteratively test different market segments and pricing in order to achieve a strong adoption.  


**Pre-Metrics**: 
We cannot afford to be ever be wrong about the key AI capability that we are developing as they simply cost too much time and money to develop.  Each one should be viewed as an existential bet for the company---betting incorrectly could literally kill the company by absorbing too much time and money in the attempt.  Thus, if not sufficiently confident we must be test these capabilities by offering potential products via manual simulation operating at a loss as a way of validating the value of the technology.

(Note: I think we ARE betting the company on AI basketball stats w/o a real pre-metric test.  I think it is ok, if we are wrong, the company likely fails, but I think the indirect evidence is strong enough to warrant this risk.)


**Current Activities**:
- Building an MVP capacity for BallerTV.
- Providing incidental value to offset cost of manual annotations.



## DOMINATION

**Objective**: Dominate a large, cohesive, sticky market having network effects.

**Reasoning**: 
- We need some "secret sauce" that provides an "unfair" advantage enabling deep penetration into a market having many competitors.  
- Full-AI sport stats could provide unique features and a disruptive pricing both of which could be the "unfair" advantages need to drive deep market penetration.
- But we believe Full-AI sport stats cannot be sustained as a disruptive differentiation.  There will be diminishing returns once basic stats are solved.  Further our core user base is quite price sensitive (thats how we got them!) thus they will be less willing to pay for ever fancier analytics.  A race to the bottom will ensue.
- Sustained differentiation will only accrue to those that have established som

**Framing**:
- SEGMENT - The consumer user segment who will be validated as loving the product
- FEATURES - The core features this product will provide to these consumers

**Top Targets**:
1. BASKETBALL AAU MARKET - 
2. MENS REC BASKETBALL LEAGUES - 
3. ???


**Target Choice Decision Criteria**
- A market that is very price sensitive
- A market accessible via a very low cost customer adoption strategy
- A market served by full-AI
- A market with significant network effects
- A market that is currently not served by dominating incumbents


**Metrics**:
- TBD

**Current Actions**:
- None.
