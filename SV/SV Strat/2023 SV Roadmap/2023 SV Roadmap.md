The SportsVisio 2023 Roadmap

Less is more, we have boiled down our activities into four over arching pillars for organizing and prioritizing our efforts in 2023.  Each pillar is an essential component of our strategy that together provide a minimal and robust basis:  (1) for our bridge-round / A-round VC investments, (2) for sustained differentiation based on AI-stats, and (3) for  strong week-over-week new customer growth.

Each pillar is described both as a an objective and as a criteria being optimized.  Each pillar will have its own backlog of product features that are aimed at optimizing performance against that pillar's objective.  We will maintain a rough prioritization and ordering of the release features in each of these four backlogs that the teams can rely upon for their longer term plannings.  Still teams should expect sprint-by-sprint to this ordering on the basis of execution realities along with unplanned near-term additions on rare occasion.  Still the four pillars themselves can serve as a north star for the company over this next year and possibly beyond.
