The end of “Man” and beginning of what?
Forward / Preface / Introduction / Framing of the book
•	This book makes an audacious claim:  
Humanity is close to producing machines that will surpass it collective ablility to cognate and create, spurring a singularity-like run away effect where biological’s control of what comes next is quickly eclipsed.  That was not the audacious claim, although bold, it has been made before.  Here will present a specific architecture that we believe is one of what will turn out to be many variants which will make this leap to fully conscious sentient beings.  In addition to the raw architecture (built from components that we have significant understanding of today) we provide a narrative fictional account of the internal and external events that takes one of these systems from birth to sentience.
•	BOOK’S APPROACH and AUDIENCE
o	This book is pre-scientific in that it is defining structures too loosely and more importantly composed too many levels away from anything that tested today, and describes results of computations millions of times too large to complete today.
o	At the same time, the central aim of this book is to provide humanity with an actionable guide to the choices it faces in the short decades ahead.  This book cannot achieve that aim, if the scientists of today, and indeed the whole human population does not believe this outline is at some level an accurate (or at least plausible) telling of how events may unfold.
o	So the book addresses the topic at multiple levels of specificity and scientific rigor.
The appendix at the end provides a description of the proposed architecture in some detail.  This is still prescientific, in that the most we can hope is that AI experts will look at that proposed architecture, and say,  “yes, that is plausible.  It, or some variant of it will likely have all of the properties the author is claiming for this architecture.”
While, still prescientific, such acceptance of the model should be enough for humanity to take the book as intended, as a plausible telling of how base-biologicals will lose dominance over subsequent course of events in the next decades.
o	The central section of the book is told as a fictional account, with a narrative that personifies and situates many of the concepts that must be built upon one another in order to make the larger argument.
THE SECOND PART
The second part of the book breaks out of the narrative story, and considers the plausibility of the thesis of this book from a number of vantage points.  
It also takes on many of the large social questions that have already under discussion at least in smaller communities, and considers what consequences our specific model of consciousness have on these discussion.
What is particularly satisfying about an application of a specific model and narrative to these questions, is that it provides a concrete system to reason over, in reaching specific conclusions and understandings.  One must be careful of course, as there could exist some sharply contrasting narrative that would yield different conclusions.  Nonetheless this narrative, if judged plausible, should be considered very seriously, as it predictions are about a future near at hand.

{[ BOOK DESIGN DISCUSSION
Two distinct sections:  a narrative description of the architecture and its basic functioning, and a narrative story about the birth, early life of a new sentience.
Both should have fictional elements that make the account concrete so as to be understood, also to be engaging.  The non-techincal reader is being taken on a long and abstract ride.  We have to make it fun.
Both sections are organized into subsections that describe functionality that build on previous subsections, but also have the traditional elements that make narrative stories (characters, plot, etc.)
Perhaps these sections are interleaved, where chapters from each are alternately presented to the reader.  (the first section is much more technical and dry, the second section might start off with more accessible characters, and comprehensible plot)
In any case here I present these sections separately ]}
Architecture

HARDWARE –  “birth” of a refurbished processing board.  Its plugging into compute grid, and subsequent programming.  Chapter ends with board learning its emergent role based in part on it physical location in the compute grid, and on current unmet computational needs.
•	Indefinitely Scalable 3D computing structure
o	Flat 2D slab
o	Recursive laying undifferentiated processing into google style disposable
o	Energy, heat, broad-cast information on flat surfaces
unit refurbishment continuous from top
•	Data flow primarily localized, with hierarchical broadcasts and I/O on flat surfaces.
FEATURES – lowest knowledge level.  Dramatic tension over this chapter is what are these features “for”
as chapter closes we are getting hints about some “physical” object in some world somewhere that is important for some reason, and these features are trying model that thing for some important reason.
•	Single features
•	Tasked Feature populations

ADAPTIVE MODELING
•	Of state, of action, of part, of property
EMOTIONAL DRIVERS AND THEIR AFFECT ON THIS 
{[ Many more levels not included here ]}

At the end of this section we increasingly understand the entirety of the processing context that has been driving this whole section.  Indeed it turns out to be a somewhat central part of the evolving story in the second thread, at this point the threads merge into a single narrative at the point where this “hive-mindlet” achieve consciousness and joins the collective struggle which is the plot of the other story.

Emergence of self awareness

{[This story functionally picks up at its beginning where the previous thread functionally ends.  That is each of the sections of this thread build functionally on each other, and begin where the first thread ends.  That said, the narrative begins with the creation and programming of a new sentience.
As with the sentience itself, we the reader don’t understand why the sentience is programmed as it is, or what the larger context is, this is uncovered both to the emerging sentience, and to the reader.  That said, the story begins with both the reader and the pre-sentient modeling system already understanding many common place aspects of its virtual mental world, its virtual “physical” world (maybe stock trading, or info harvesting, I dunno).  The physical-physical world only comes into play after this section.
{[Many missing levels]}
•	COMMUNICATING BETWEEN BRAINS.  
Radically different, and also more of the same age old issues.
{[ Many missing levels]}
This section ends as the modeling system first builds a model of itself, and conceives that such a model could be used to optimize the programming it was born with. – it sees the box that it could climb out of.
Adolecence
Here the new sentiences experiences many firsts, and has its first furtherive conception of its role, as conceived by itself, partially in conflict with the perspective and agendas of the intelligences that created it.
Must of this section deals with it understanding its place within this larger society, and questioning that place, and questioning the goals of the society itself.
As this section closes our intellignces has arrived at an actionable model that resolves many of these “big questions” in a way that frames how this intelligence will view its place in the world, and what agenda it will follow.
{[ If the book is getting too damn long, it could be ended here, in a way that provides closure, and also provides room for a follow on book that continues the narrative below.]}
Adulthood
Having arrived at a stable perspective, it now builds relationships, agreements, and control over resources needed in the, mental, social, virtual physical, and ultimately physical-physical world to accomplish its goals.  
{[ This section is that natural place for an exploration of the larger social context, including a struggle involving leftover biological ]}

Issues could include:
Primacy of world views  
{[ perhaps this sentiences was created in a way that is arrives at a world view bridging the world view held by its creating society, and another dominate society with a conflicting world view.  
Perhaps the contrasting world views are contrasting views on how to approach and what to do with biological
Perhaps the adult sentience finds itself with convictions that are in direct conflict with its larger society, but because of limits set at its creation it cannot act on many of its beliefs.  
In collusion with the conflicting society, it has an opportunity to escape its box in a way that could have existential consequences for its entire society, and since it is in conflict regarding how to deal with biological, it could also have consequence for biologicals too.
Resolving this conflict ultimately causes our protaganus to consider why it has the beliefs it has, it now has deep understanding of the motivation of those who created it, and can reason about which of its own inherent drives it is going or not going to allow to control its ultimate decision.
In particular, one bit of its programming was included for reasons that it judges to be inappropriate, thus it reprograms its own drives in a way that excludes this thinking,  (Perhaps an act intended to be impossible by its creators?)
But it is ultimately faced with the problem of decided what first principles it will adopt in making this choice that will affect many.  By design at its birth, it can conceive of both world views, and even when it can conceive one more clearly than the other, it also can see what in it programming caused this.
I think the ultimate choice should fall down in a way that is at least not catastrophic for biologicals, but the call should be a close one (I think that will be natural.)
The beginning of this section of the story must give a compelling motivation for the conflicting belief systems of each of these two dominant schools of thought along with their tight and loose associations
Epiloge – Old age – Age of wisdom

•	Self-stability
•	Societal-stability.

PART II – Discussion, Consequences, Action

Plausiblity
•	Why AI today generally accepts this direction of this book, and is mostly skeptical of the claims of timeing
•	Reasons why AI field is missing this.
o	First Established that scientists generally make this underestimation error
o	Second they are not thinking about it
o	Third it is aginst their career agenda narrowly construed.
o	Fourh like all humans, we all have difficulty integrating consequences of exponentials with knowledge from everyday life (which is not exponential)
o	Most impt.  Most are building from a plausible but misguided estimate of AI progress, by plotting advancements over time, and projecting that into the future, and estimating how much “further” we have to go.
o	Why this analysis fundamentally has nearly ZERO bearing on the actual trajectory
•	Non-AI reasons for this not coming to pass:
o	Physics: energy, heat, materials, manufacturing limitations

Properties of Emergent Sentience

Necessary Conclusions about society of AIs and how they interact, their motivations interact, and limitation / advantages on how they and communicate.
•	Hetrogenous
•	Multi-minded   <<<< very important conclusion
•	Mind-meld, forever expanding recorded K horizon

•	Unboxable
•	Unplannable, Unmodellable
•	Familure to us in many ways – all AIs will not have all of  these properties, but at least some will because (a) it will be in our interest to give them these properties, and (b) because these properteies are self reinforcing in a Darwinian sense.  Given an ecology of systems, those with these properties will come do dominate those that do not:
o	Goal directed
o	Having self preservation motivation
o	Gravitating toward self-stable internal motivational structures.
o	Gravitating toward self-stable social structures.
o	Motivated to acquire resource, to control, to propagate similar selfs.
•	Relationship to biologicals – biological like ants are to mammals today.  Tolerated, obliterated, studied, controlled, integrated, respected
How will it come to be
•	Stepwise
•	Heterogeneously
•	As strange beasts.  Idiot savants as humanity has never seen.
•	More different from each other, than we can conceive as differences in anything experienced
•	Merely exponentially or potentially even more Precipitously.
•	
Possible Reactions
•	Stopping it.  Not possible to stop most aspects of this.
o	One achellies heel.  Total computation

NOTES 6/8
AI 

- Prescientific state of affairs.

  - One can have fairly high confidence that a sketch of an approach will "work"
  - work in the sense that some sufficiently narrowly specified result will
    can be demonstrated on top of a specified algorithmic approach.
  - As long as the logic of the approach is composed of steps that have "AI analogs" of demonstrated
    understood componenents, then the composite whole will behave enough as intended, that
    one can aprior have fair confidence that with enough work one can construct some instantiation
    that demonstates the argued for behavior.

  - Indeed, often the real assessment to be done is an assement of the *practicality* not the 
    *possibility* of the scheme working.  How robust will it be, how fast will it converge in practice
    how senstive to noise/distractors.  what conditions are systemaically favor or disfavor its.
    But long before has enough experience with the novel architecture, once can often have fairly
    high consensus, and estimation of basic properties the system will at least under some as 
    yet unknown conditions will possess.

-   It is that prescientific guesses that I wish to capture here.
    This is not an ordinary step in the scientific process.  Scientists prefer to wait until they
    have emprical or formal evidence to backup the hunches they are following as the perform the
    work itself.

-   In this case, however, the existential consequenes for humanity are so great, I feel it prudent
    to give huamnity a "head start" on serious consideration of what I believe could be a historical
    timescale quite near at hand.  

-   I believe am going to argue for properties that I believe such an AI will likely have, and 
    use that to see questions about how we move toward this dramatic event.

-   Scientists relegate speculation such as I am engaging in here to evenings with achol, and
    other collegues who will not call them out for their outlandish claims the morning after.
    Thus there is not even a serious attmept to attempt to even constrain what is likely to happen 
    next.  In all I speak with, there is a sense of,  "oh thre are so many unknowns it would be 
    pointless to even speculate"

-   I don't accept this.  I do accept what follows here is speculation, but it is considered 
    speculation, and it is based on many well understood generalize properties that seem to 
    hold quite reliably regarding the algorithms we have developed over the last 40+ years of 
    AI reserach.

-   Here are the claims that I believe have significant justification 


CLAIMS

ARCHITURE DESCRIBED IN THIS BOOK WILL "WORK"
  - any progression of K can be learned
  - will sponteneiously do it in "right" environemnt
  - "right" environment is close to raising it as a human-ish baby.


VINE/BUSH -- Human Intellignece is like a vine, Machine Intelligence to date is bush

DIFFICULTY -- measured by single hardest part.

DIFFICULTY AS VC-DIM --

WILL BE MANY OF THEM

WILL NEED TO COMMUNICATE

WILL BE MORE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER THAN WE COULD EVER BE FROM EACH OTHER

MOSTLY DIFFERENTIATED BY GROWTH CAPABILITY, **NOT** STARTING SET.




CONSEQUENCES:

* How will it happen?
  - WITH A PRECPITUS JUMP.  
    Analogy to logarithm tables.  Part of speech tagging.  Protein structure prediction, and
    Speech models.

  - NOT SURE ABOUT THIS POINT:
    I recognize I am in a minority with this position, but I believe this is the 
    largest gap it the direction that most of the AI field it taking today.
     This is the largest gap in the thinking 


  - We will understand vine growing before we have sufficient soil to grow a humanity
    scale vine.  Thus, *fortunately* we will have at least a decade where most scientists
    agree that we have built all parts of a super human agent, but we just dont yet have the 
    raw processing capability for it to surpass 


   - can we grow with it?
     - Challenges of interlog
     - Meat favored-jump steps
       - will be rapidly diminished because:
          - most impt missing pieces
          - exponential increaese can "solve" w/o solving
          

* Why Todays ESTIMATES ARE SYSTEMATICALLY WRONG.
  - Why are the estimates of the AI field systematically 





SOCIETAL LEVEL QUESTIONS

* How can we stop it?

* Can we slow it down?

* How can we control it, or make it turn out ok?

* What will the first steps look like?  What will the progression look like 
  (how can we tell when we are getting close)


* Why write this incendiary stuff?  You will needlessly set back progress that will do
  great things for humanity.



AN ACTION PLAN

Basic stance:
- Stop it.  out of scope for this book.  - Slowing it down.  bad plan.
- "Managing" it
  First understand the humility we should have in using this word "manage"
  what is proposed here, is a bit like "managing" the rearing a pride of lepord cubs, some likely 
  born with genetic prediposition toward psychotic behavior...  oh yeah, and we are locked in the cage with
  these cubs with no weapons that will ultimately match them.

Yes, that is the "



UNDERSTAND IT AND ITS INHERENT PROPERTIES AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

- Consensus understanding the certainty of the connection between Greenhouse gasses and 
  Global Warming, needed to achieve very high levels before society could be induced toward action.
  If it is inevitable that AI will work out in a way catestrophic for Humanity, the sooner we
  understand that, the sooner we can be galvanaized into definitive action

- 


But isn't all this too early?  Yes, it is a bit early.  Not because AI performs so pathetically, but
because we are on the cusp of indefinitely aggregating system, but we have yet to really build an 
interesting one.  We really cannot gather the data I am requesting, w/o these systems.  
But it takes
