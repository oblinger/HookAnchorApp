Thesis: Within AI systems, Knowledge, Drive, and Agency can be split apart in ways that have no analog for biological systems.


Discussion:

Within AI systems we can already see it is possible to construct systems that have different combinations of these components in ways that don't map well or at all onto biological systems.




DRIVES

For our purposes a system is said to have a drive if it tends to peruse that drive when it is able to do so, and will attempt to do this over a wide range of circumstances.

Thus the drive for a system is an intrinsic aspect of the system.
