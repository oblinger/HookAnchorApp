## Introduction

- The field of cyber security has matured over XXX years into a set of best practices for developing and maintaining reliable computing systems.
- We now have a good understanding for what can and cannot be expected from the reliability of these systems.







## Cyber Model




## Failure Argument - Intransigence
- Chief conclusion:  Alignment will fail in all ensconced computing systems.
- Ensconced:
	- Implemented using the substrate of the physical world
	- Implemented within a collection of intentional agents where not all agents have aligned intentions.


## Future Cyber Contexts

- INTRO:  The inevitability of alignment-failure is based upon a cyber model derived from present day and historical cyber systems.  Will this model apply to all future computing systems, or will they deviate in some key ways which invalidate this model and our conclusions about alignment failure.  Here we consider several leading possibilities.

- 0-day sparsity:  Freeze system and study hell out of it.

- Attack Surface Shrinkage: Make system super simple, so there is less volume to attack.

- The Dynamics of Pwning - The von Neumann architecture was designed to service the widest possible range of capabilities using a single piece of hardware.  It was quite distinct from the computing systems that preceeded it.
	- Consequence of this universality is suseptability of powning.  (compare pwning a trajectory calculator vs. a von Neumann machine)
	- Because of this tremendous power computer scientists often generate extremely pwnable subsystems within their computing system.
	- But could we forego this tremendous power and instead develop 
	
- Diverse peers with comparable capacity and diverse objectives


## The Intransigence 'So What?'

- Hyper hetrogenaity - Maximize diversity across instantiations of aligned systems so any attack will not succeed on all systems.
- Policing - Overwhelming capability (force) used to negate consequences of misalignment.
- Social Alignment Pressure - Aligned agents observe non-aligned behaviors and curtail non-aligned agent's ability to operate
- Alignment fixed points -
