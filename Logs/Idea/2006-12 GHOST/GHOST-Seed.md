# GHOST-Seed --

    CHECK IN. Sri@BAE: write white paper to 07-42.  How much? 500K?

    SOW:
    - Empirical (Psychologial and other) library reserach 
        into current state of knowledge
      - Connect with GMU & other academics
      - New lab testing for GHOST
    - GHOST scenerios research
    - New start analysis
      - Look at formal work done
    - Build Peer to Peer system 
    - Broad mandate for exploring use of internet + computation

    * Create seed to explore this




                                         Science Magazine; AI Magazine; 
    New Area:

     * Intro:  what could a self val process be?  how could one do it?

     * Parts of a whole solution. 
       Then defining the formal question:

    HW; SW; P2P alg; proofs 

          honest; dishonest; non-compliance

     * Self validating processes:   GHOST -- guaranteed honest organizational self testing
       - define honest/[dis]
       - distributed process
       - certificate
       - ghost properties can be statistically proven by outside observer given certificate and assumptions about honesty distribution

     * Define proof technique framework
       - Strongest link algorithms
       - Antogonistic collaborators
       - epsilon-delta proofs that honest person will be in right place at right time
       - distributed knoweldge and independet trials to prove guessing is impossible


     * Simple building blocks for this framework
       - Time capsules
       - Time Dice


    * Challenges: psychological

    Context:

    Assumed Components:

    Def:  Shared Computational Substrate.  
    Hardware&Software assumed by framework.  Includes messaging system, and publication system

    An organization is a collection of people, interacting using a distributed com resource.
    Def: org is set of nodes,  xxxx plus shared computational resources.
    Def: a node is a single person, and the computational resources controlled by that individual.


    The  concerned public is a collection of people that are not members of the organization, but who care about the operation of the organization.
    Def: The public is a set of humans
    Def: To publish a message is to make it available to all public & org



    Def:  A GHOST process is a published specification of a computational process, an optional set of steps to be executed by humans, and
          a set of constraints that must hold during the execution of both human and machine processes.
    * process typically computes so results, and declares a set of properties that hold on the process and the computed results.


    Def:  An honest node, is a node whose machine and human processes are executed according the published specification.
    Def:  An accurate node, is a node that 
    Def:  A complient node, is a node at the very least complies 
    Def:  A  dishonest node is a node 


    Def: A GHOST proof is a proof with the following structure:
     (1) Given some minimal assumption regarding an organzation's honest, and
     (2) a computed certificate, then 
         prove that some property, P, holds
       
     assumes some minimal level of honest and compliance

    Def: A GHOST process is a process
