## = Starting conclusions
- CANNOT AVERT THE COMING OF DOMINATING-AI
	- CANT CONTAIN IT
	- CANT STOP BUILDING IT
	- CANT BLOCK IT WITH REGULATION - can SHAPE it, but cannot BLOCK it
	- CANT ALIGN IT

## = Path of Peace



## = Building It

- Type 1 vs Type 2 reasoning

- Savants 
- Triangulation 
- Bootstrapping 
- Agency

## = Nature of Things
- bootstrapping all of human knoledge is much easier than extending beyond it
- learning isolated things is much easier than extending basic chip speeds etc.
	- So knowlege will jump up quick and stop; processing will jump up quickly and stop.  drives diversity.

## = How It Unfolds

- Begins with agency built upon learnable type-II reasoning

- Cauldron of alternatives

- Quickly jumping capacities

- Marketplace take over
	- Level-0 marketplace take over - Digitized and ML-optimized solutions in market
	- Level-1 take over - Isolated - self-modeling-self-improving-agents solutions
	- Level-2 take over - agent 2 agent linking


	- Could result in dramatic diversity, or run-away success monopolies
		- Could AI-agents enforce market competitions? 

	- physical capability-dependent diversity will drive overall market diversity



- Diversity of agendas (core programming, early experience)

- Diversity of contextually dependent abilities
	- Hedge-fund   &  ( mapping-service,  combi-chemistry-robot )
	- Execution Arb Service
	- Execution Aggregation Service
