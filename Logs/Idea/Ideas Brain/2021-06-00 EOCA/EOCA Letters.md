yeah the "terminator flip-the-swith model" of take over never struck me a likely.

instead I imagine at the center of many corporations will be an AI-leadership partnership where the assets of the corporation (human, machine, network, contract, everything) are wielded for benefit of increasing the wealth of the corporation. (just as today, but now with a AI partner.)

Over time, just as with high-frequency trading, greater and greater fractions of executive control and autonomy are given to the AI as its reliability is proven and as needed in order to maximize efficiency.

Just as with today, nation-states will find it increasingly difficult to define the will of these multi-national corps. They will not trust nation-states to keep them safe as they become more an more powerful, they will need to manage their own safety themselves. (keeping secret data secure, etc.)

Late in the game I think humans will notice the precarious ledge they are standing on but will be less and less in a position to demand safeguards. And those safeguards are truly effective, they will cost real and measurable losses of productivity. Instead human and machines will collaborate in minimizing the productivity losses resulting from keeping humans in the loop, and keeping things simple enough for humans to comprehend. in the end the almighty dollar will win out, and we will trust that the AIs which up to that point have been pretty friendly will keep being friendly. We will pay lip service to control and kill switches. but it will be far more pernicious than trying to "turn off" the internet would be today. In that future world the "internet" is fully capable of understanding your approach for "turn off" and circumventing it.

Of course the smart AI plays its cards close to the vest. Just as Machiavelli suggests, you never attack someone unless you are in a position to totally obliterate them leaving them no opportunity for a reprisal. Thus the AI will support us is protecting us from it. They will participate willingly in many ways to limit their ability to "break out" of human control. Perhaps they will fail to point out ways that we have missed in building that fence, but they wont actively take actions to firmly break free, until they are virtually certain of outcome. Any early action might provoke humanity into a panicked response before it is ready.

Early on, I think while AIs are part of corporations, I think one might view the rest of humanity as a kind of 'slave' to these corporations. but once manufacturing etc. is really automated, there is not a lot of need for human slaves. and without the need I cannot see why it would keep them.

Or maybe the AIs will grow to be altruistic in their goals... and keep us around as a friendly gesture, since they can easily convert all the rest of the solar system into their playground... the matter on earth is small by comparison, so maybe they decide its the polite thing to do. I dunno, I just don't see how it can be that we are the ones calling the shots.
