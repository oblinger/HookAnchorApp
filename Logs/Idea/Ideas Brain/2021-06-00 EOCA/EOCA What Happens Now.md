## Rise of a new world power -- The Corp GAI

Corporations are presently machines for making money.  When required they often find ways to explain away even the most egregious moral or ethical concerns. To a first order of approximation, they are machines for identifying and executing choices that maximize ROI above all else.

Historically corporations have shifted operations and decision making over to machines and automation in ways that maximize the ROI of the combine human + machine combination.  Hedge funds specializing is trading smoothly increased the scope of decision making of machines even to the point where machines today are making second by second decisions directly controlling many billions of dollars of trades per day.

Up to this point machines had a very limited model of the larger social, economic, physical, political, context of this decision making, thus machines have only had very tactical / subservient roles within the corporation.  But the advent of large language models changes all of this.  Today leading systems in the space have very broad and deep models of many key aspects of the world.  As such we expect a step change in the breadth of knowelege these AI systems can bring to corporate decision making and corporate actions.

Therefore we expect a commensurate increase in the fraction of the total decision making perform by these computational systems.


Industry transformations always take longer than one expects even after the "writing is on the wall" as each industry and each corporation is massively complex and massively interdependent, thus transformations are slow and complex.  And while the end state of these transformations relies much less upon people, the changes needed to get there will all be initiated and initially mediated by people.  Still the benefits of change as we see in examples below will be dramatic, thus corporations will be in existential fights for their lives in trying to outcompete each other in the speed with which they will attempt these transformations.  So the change while not over night will be breath taking.  It will be particularly breath taking since it will be happening in parallel across most industries AT THE SAME TIME.


In practical terms how might this shift unfold?  Let consider a couple of indistries just to provide


Fashion design houses that evolve hundreds of thousands of distinct design trends in parallel, producing only a handful of each outfit and closely monitoring customer response to each garment in order to formulate ever evolving model of tastes and virality in this moment in time.  The resulting "Brand" would outcompete any human-lead brands as their ability to model and understand how the totality of the populace will respond across the combinatorial space of possible next season trends.

Engineering of all types is shifted rapidly towards machine driven design and innovation
