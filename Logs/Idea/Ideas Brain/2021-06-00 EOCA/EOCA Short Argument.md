# THE ROLLUP

### 2023-05-09  Rollup Argument

- BOOTSTRAPPING IS THE KEY - 
- AI JUMPS - 
- MISSING LINK - 


# THE PARTS


- BOOTSTRAPPING IS KEY - 
	- SCALED HUMAN REASONING WILL ALREADY BE SUPER - 
	- HUMAN REASONING IS BOOTSTRAPPED FROM A SMALL SEED - 
	- WE ARE LIKELY NOT FAR FROM BUILDING THIS SEED.
	- ONCE CLOSE WE SIMPLY CANNOT STOP FROM BUILDING THE SEED.
	- UPGRADED AI PERFORMANCE WILL BE DISCONTINUOUS - 
	- 
	- HUMAN REASONING is a combination of type I and type II reasoning 
	- TYPE-I is akin to deep nets today, and TYPE-II is "macro controlled" TYPE-I reasoning.
	- We can likely discover how to do this in 

#### Mind Seed
- SEED IS KEY - A mind seed is pragmatically necessary and sufficient for bootstrapping a mind
- SEED IS CLOSE - We are likely 'close' to developing the first artificial mind seed
- SEED BUILDS MINDS - 
- PERFORMANCE WILL JUMP - 


#### SEED CONTEXT
- EMBODIED THINKING - 
- TRAINING ON THINKING - 

#### CONSEQUENCES
- INTROSPECTIVE MIND IS LIKELY UNCONTROLLABLE - 

- WE ARE UNCONTROLLABLE - 


## Alignment is likely impossible

### End Run Is Always Available

### Universality of Boundary Pushing


## Background


#### Kolmogorov Complexity of the Human Brain

GENOME SIZE


BRAIN ALG SIZE
- 600M -- a reference-free compressor minimizes the data [of the human genome] to -580 MB.  https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/9/11/giaa119/5974977
- 20K genes (1/3 of the genome) encodes for brain structures.
