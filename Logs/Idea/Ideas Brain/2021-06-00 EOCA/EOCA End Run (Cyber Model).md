! Cyber Model of AGI safety

## Intro
**FIELD MATURITY** - 
The field of cyber security has matured through several decades of innovation in both cyber offense and cyber defense.  The competitive nature of the cyber context has caused the field to push itself with each advancement in either offense or defense spurring the urgent requirement to develop an effective counter.  This innovation pipeline for both offense and defense has been very well funded at the state, corporate, and individual levels for decades now.  This has resulted in a certain degree of maturity to the field.  We have gone thru dozens of cycles of innovation / counter-innovation.  Enough to see a very repeatable pattern in the ways that this relentless innovation / counter-innovation plays out at the technical and social levels.

CYBER IMPLICATIONS FOR AGI
The lessons learned regarding the ways battles play out in cyber security afford a valuable window into the inevitable nature of AGI systems.
The first AGI systems will, in ways more profound than any generation that has come before, be the world's first "digital natives."

IMPLICATION #1 - WEAPONIZATION WILL BE IMMEDIATE AND INEVITABLE

IMPLICATION #2 - CATASTROPHIC FAILURES WILL PERSIST

IMPLICATION #3 - FORMAL FRAMEWORKS FAIL

IMPLICATION #4 - ALIGNMENT WONT WORK
