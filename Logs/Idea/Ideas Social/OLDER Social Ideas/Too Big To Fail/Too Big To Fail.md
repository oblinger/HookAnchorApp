=== Problem Framing ===


The country needs a stable banking system running at all times, 
thus it must be "bailed out" anytime it is not functioning.

Allowing investors to profit from risks the bank takes while making the taxpayer pay when those risks fail is not fair, and not an efficient market.

Ensuring that a bank will not fail is too complex and too onerous for banking rules to accomplish, it will still fail and it will be less efficient while operating under these rules.


GOAL:
A banking ecosystem that: 
- As a whole will never stop operating (e.g. lending money etc.) 
- Will never require a taxpayer bailout when individual banks fail.
- Does not depend upon regulations or government to keep banks solvent.
- Does not saddle banks with complex monitoring rules and regulation.


Key insight:  
-- Big money is always smarter than any regulator-driven monitoring system.
-- Solution is to structure insolvency so fallout 100% falls on the head of big money.
-- Once this is done, big money will naturally take risks and suffer consquences 
   in fincially prudent ways naturally.


SOLUTION:
For all organizations that are "too big to fail"  The government **RELAXES** many of the most onerous monitoring and regulating that is presently does to ensure they do not fail, and instead replaces all of this ineffective stuff with a much lighter weight commitment requriements.


(1) SPLIT COMPANY -- On paper Big Co is split into two companies.  The first company Big_Co_Operations is a services company that is employed by Big_Co_Holdings.  All of the employess work for Big Co Operations while all the assets and liabilities are held by Big Co Holdings 2020.  This is just a paper split.  In practice everyone still goes to work everyday and nothing operationally is different.  A bit of accounting is done each year to flow the right amount of money to the operations co, but they are managed jointly.


(2) EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT -- Nearly all employees work for Operations Co except for the CEO.  The CEO is the only employee working for Big Co Holdings, along with the board of directors that manage the Holdings Co.  Operations Co also has a designated CEO, but this person really is just a VP that reports to the main CEO of Holdings Co.  Operations Co has the same board members that holdings co has.


NOTICE: Upto here nothing has really changed.  There is a company split, but it is an entirely paper split.  In practice no ones incentives or day to day actions have changed.



(3) NEXT CO -- Each too big to fail is required to create a second holdings company.  Here we will call this Holdings_Co_Next.  It is not yet capitalized nor operational, but it exists legally, it has a  distinct CEO, and distinct board of directors that regularly meet to ensure that Future Co is "ready to go" when needed.


(4) FAIL OVER -- In the event that the holding co goes into default, that it cannot service its daily debt obligations, then it "fails over" to future co.  Immediately the bank begins serving customers using the same operations personnel, but not operating from a fresh balance sheet with no debts and a big cash infusion.  Over time those same employees also help to "unwind" the now failed balance sheet trying to maximize money returned to investors.  But critically the bank continues to operate with a fresh balance sheet with a healthy cash infusion.

(5) REMERGE -- Within some time window (say 6 months) if the original holdings company is able to fully service its obligations and get back into the black then it can unilaterally re-absorb the Next Co Holdings balance sheet and become one comapny again.  If not, then its assets are simply liquidated and used to service its outstanding debts as best as it can.


FAIL OVER IN DETAIL -- Here is what happens in more detail:
**WHEN** -- Fail over occurs the morning after that the bank was unable to pay its daily obligations.
**BLANK SHEET** -- Future Co has a fresh balance sheet, it has no assets, but also no liabilities.
**CASH INFUSION** -- The first transaction for Future Co is payment of the "default penalty" paid by the original holdings co.  The default penalty is 25% of the operating reserve that the government mandated that holding Co kept as its reserve.  This will cause additional pain for the already distressed original holding co, but it provides the new holding company with a very strong balance sheet since it is starting with zero liabilities.
**BUSINESS AS USUAL** -- The next day in most ways it is "buisness as usual" for all employees still working at operations co.  The newly operational fresh holdings co already has an operating reserve it can use to service new loans etc.
**TWO CUSTOMERS** -- Operations Co now has two customers, the original holdings co and the now operaational Next Co Holdings Company.  On this first day the previously designated Operations Co becomes a "real" CEO in the sense that they no longer report to the original Holdings Co CEO, but instead must negotiate how both services and payments will be split between the two holding companies.  
- The first order of business is to ensure that existing customers have uninterupted access to new credit and new loans.
- Fresh lines of credit for existing customers will be easy since they are already vetted and the new balance sheet is flush with operating capital.
- Those customers that held financial ASSETS with the holding co will be in more desperate shape since those assets are now frozen inside original Holding Co balance sheet.  Next Co's CEO has full access to orignal Co's books, so he can have operations co do a quick and dirty assessement percentage payout that is ultimately likely from those holdings.  Then he can allow lines of additioanl credit which are collaeralized by assets still held within the now frozen holding co balance sheet.
	Accepting any colleraization from those now frozen assets is a risk so s/he will set some limits and premiums accordingly.
**BOARD OF DIRECTORS** -- Next Co has an already designated board of directors which are distict from orginal holding co, and not finacially connected to investments in orginal co.  They serve interests of the new balance sheet, and as new investors are added to next co, they will naturally gain board representation.  Operations Co now has two masters and so its board must reflect this.  Its board will be taken from members of each holding companies boards with the chairman and one additional member coming from next co.  (This ensures that the big money behind original holdings co cannot push the operations co around.)



**REMERGE OUTCOME** -- The cost of fail over for the original holding company is pretty disasterous.  It was forced to pay a penalty of 25% of it operating margin, and it lost ability to originate new loans, its CEO is adrift on a rapidly sinking ship.  But it is possible that this interruption in ability to pay was temporary.  Perhaps some customers might accept partial payments now, other debts owed are paid etc.  IF this CEO can bring this bank back into good standing, then they have the option to forcably remerge the Next Co balance sheet back into itself and to regain that 25% penalty.  (There would be some time limit placed on this option, say six months, just so Next Co can one day be certain of its future.)


**LIQUIDATION OUTCOME** -- Assuming that the Original Holdings Co cannot be made whole, then it is liquidated over time.  After the six month mark the board for the Operations Co drops all members from orginal holding co, and its members becomes identical to the board of the Next Co holding company, and its CEO now officially reports to the CEO of Next Co Holdings.  By this time the Next Co's CEO is required to have created the Next-Next holding co, along with its inactive CEO and board.  At this point the bank is back to the exact position it was in the beginning just with a different balance sheet, and different holding co CEO. 



NOTICE HOW WE GOT THE INCENTIVES RIGHT HERE:

- LITTLE GOV MONITORING -- Government does not need strong monitoring for these banks 
- BIG MONEY WILL BE WATCHING -- The big money investors that are making fat profits from the operations of the bank will be carefully watching --- THEY will be very accurately balancing the profits they are making agaist the very very real whirling blades of consqeunces that will rip them to shreds on the very day their balance sheet goes negative.  
- REAL MOTIVATION -- Nothing is more motivating to big money than the _loss_ of that big money.  It is not that the bank will never take risks, it still will, when big profits are to be made.  It is just that big money knows that Uncle Sam is not standing in front of the meat grinder which awaits it on that zero line.  NOTHING stands between it and those whirling blades of consequence except its own cunning in taking judicious risks...  risky enough to make money, but not so risky that it all blows up.
- SELF RUNNING -- what makes this system self regulating is that we have concentrated most of the negative consequences associated with risky investment choices and aimed them at the heads of those whose pockets are filling with the profits made from those same choices.  In this way a natural balance of risk/reward is found.
- INSTANTANEOUS -- By creating the fail over organization BEFORE times of distress occur ensures it is ready to act on the very day it is needed.
- SMART MONEY -- Smart money board of directors will ensure that employees in Operations Co have bonuses and some (government limited) portion of their retirement stored in the assets of Holding Co.  This smart money work hard to ensure that the employees of Operations Co have good reason to alert the Holding Co CEO of any unknown risks etc.  Smart money will want to find ways to ensure all employees have some skin in the game too.
- PUNATIVE BUT NOT TOO PUNATIVE -- Society should rightly punish big money when it operates recklessly.  Society should make those same interest pay for the damage its causes when  such damage occurs.  At the same time lets recognize that banking is complex and actual damage caused is not precisely measurable on a moment to moment basis.  Thus having a notable penalty of 25% of operating reserves is a strong disincentive for allowing fail-over to occur.  At the same time providing opportunity to remerge ensures that if actual damages turn out to be a momentary one instead of lasting, then investors can escape those losses later.  The actual penalty ends up proportional to the actual losses (e.g. haircut payouts etc.) -- we just structure it so that loss of principle, temporary lost of access to capital and uncertainty in outcomes are all focused on the very same investors making the profits.



NEXT CO DETAIL -- This approach mostly rely on big money to monitor operations and ensure good decision making at each step.  The original CEO and board of directors for Next Co Holdings is an exception to this.  That board is formed and CEO picked at a moment in time when Next Co is not funded by any investors, thus no entity yet has interest in good choices being made.  
- As a consequence the Fed itself validates that the members of board and CEO are all qualified for their positions, and to ensure that the board of directors have no overlapping interests with the existing Holding Co or Operations Co.  
- The CEO & board receive a very nominal (government mandated) pay for their services during peacful times for simply being ready to act.  As the bank becomes stressed the goverment requires that the CEO & board prepare to act, their pay is increased and they begin searching for contingent investments should the bank be required to begin operations.  The government mandates modest resources are made available to fund workers at Operations Co in signing up such contingent money.
- The CEO's salary package should be tied to a government mandated increase over their current salary along with government mandated bonus tied to Next Co performance.  The CEO signs an agreement to terminate their job and begin the CEO job the day of fail over.
- Both the board of directors and CEO compensation is expected to be renegotiated as the Next Co become funded with outside investment.
- All of this pre-ramp-up pay and contingent investment work is optional. The system works pretty well without it, but for the largest banks having contingent investors lined up and operational staff working in the week(s) prior to fail over will increase the smoothness of a transition and will only costs pennies to implement.
- As a minor tweak on the system, one could make the exact size of the default penalty vary just a bit depending on the number of days before the event the bank itself begins funding this ramp up
















STABLIZATION -- As investment flows into Next Co Holdings it will likely add/replace board memebers in order to better represent the interests of this new money.  They may opt to replace the CEO of Next Co if they see that a more experienced on is needed.  (remember the prior CEO was likely a VP from Operations Co that was designated for this role, by the Next co board, so they may or may not be up to the task of the whole bank.)


ADRIFT AT SEA -- Likely the original holding co will offer a progression of "hair cut" deals to existing asset holders allowing them exit earlier with greater likely losses sooner, while others keep assets in the frozen fund hoping for better payouts over longer time periods as assets are repaid.  This bucket of liabilities and assets is now a stand alone entity which might live on or be bought up etc. depending upon the wishes of the orignal board who represent the holders of those interests.  It no longer needs to have any real connection to the original bank, or its operational co.  It might be continue to be operated by that co or not, depending upon needs and interests of various parties.



=== ODDS AND ENDS ===

INFUSION LOAN -- On day one of fail over next co must have cash on hand in order issue new loans.  The original Holding Co may be in such bad shape that is simply does not have this cash on hand.  In that case the Fed issues the 25% loan to the new holding company as a line of credit which is collateralized by original Holding Co.  In order to ensure that the Fed incurs minimal risk here, no funds may be distributed from Holding Co until this fail over penalty is paid in full to the Fed.  In the case that Holding Co is never able to pay this penalty, then this line of credit must be paid back by Next Co holdings.
