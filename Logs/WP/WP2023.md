My friend who used to be at Waymo HR suggested that I mention the things below and focus on appealing their sympathy. I listed them out, but I am still in disability to put them together into sentences:

-   I consulted with an attorney about my situation
-   I have been going through therapy for mental health issues, and I haven't been able to even do a physical in the 2 years I was with Waymo because of how busy I was at Waymo.
-   Our family relies on my health insurance coverage
-   I've done great work which can be proven by many recognitions from people I work with, spot bonuses and peer bonuses.
-   I contributed to Waymo culture by leading the Hyphen Elevate/Mentorship program.

  

Ask:

1.  3-month extension of healthcare coverage or a lump sum payment for Cobra coverage to help me go through the transition period.
2.  4 more weeks of severance to account for my years of service at Alphabet.

Dear Waymo HR:

I am still a bit in shock at being fired from Waymo.  I knew after receiving a poor review last year that my job was in jeopardy so I really went ALL OUT to try improve my performance in order to keep the job which I was proud of and which I loved.  Indeed I thought I had succeeded when my manager Kevin told me in August that my review in 2023 would be better than it was in 2022. I guess on more careful analysis, he realized that his initial evaluation was not accurate, and that my performance was still not satisfactory.  Perhaps I could have fixed something had I known I was still failing to perform, I don't know.

The stress of knowing that I was not succeeding was very intense, I have been seeing a mental health professional over this period dealing with this, and have been so busy over these last years that I have not even kept up to date on my annual physical along with many other aspects of life. This is not Google or Waymo's fault, I need to perform, and if I can't well they have to let me go.  Still it HURTS to try so hard, to think you made it, and then still fail.

Our family relies entirely on Waymo health care, and significantly on my salary as well.  Because of this I am hopeful that Waymo can provide some support in our transition, specifically:
- A 3-month extension of our healthcare coverage (or maybe a lump sum that would cover 3 months of Cobra)
- 4 additional weeks of severance to account for my years of service at Alphabet.


Even though I did not "make the cut" at Waymo; I did do some great work while I was here, as you can see from the peer bonuses and spot bonuses I received while I was at Waymo, and because multiple employees reached out to me after getting fired to tell me that they were fans of my work and felt I had done a good job.  I also think contributed contributed broadly to Waymo culture by leading the Hyphen Elevate/Mentor program.

I don't know what will come next... Waymo was huge in my life, please let me know if you will be able to support my family in this transition.

Yours, 
Qingling Oblinger
