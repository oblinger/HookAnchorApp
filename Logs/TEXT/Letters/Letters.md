### 2022-04-06  John Cameron thank you

_John & Pam:_

Out of nowhere Qingling says... do you know a Pam Cameron? Pam?! yeah from grad school, but why? Qingling says: Because she just sent us a really nice baby carrier! huh?!? How did she even know about this??? (how DID you know, I am so terrible at social media I don't think it was even out there?) Anyways, it was a great surprise thanks!!

_Of course then the baby came, right as my startup was getting sold, and we basically blew it with all of our thank-yous for our gifts. I am writing to you now as a very, very, VERY belated thank you. It was by far my favorite baby shower gift, since it was so unexpected._

_I hope your family is well... I look forward to a catch up one of these months. (and of course if you guys are ever in San Francisco, we must meet up!!)_

_much love,_

_Dan and Qingling_
