## 2026-01-09  GLP-1 Protein Targets

*For 190 lbs (86 kg) on GLP-1 medication*

### Daily Protein Targets

| Level | Grams/day | Per meal (3 meals) | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Minimum** | 100-105g | ~33-35g | 1.2 g/kg - bare minimum |
| **Recommended** | 135-140g | ~45-47g | 1.6 g/kg - better retention |
| **Optimal** | 170g+ | ~57g+ | 2.0 g/kg - best protection |

### Protein Source Comparison (daily amounts)

| Source | Protein/oz | Cal/oz | 100g target | 140g target | 170g target |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Chicken breast** | 8.5g | 47 | 12 oz (27%)* | 16 oz (38%)* | 20 oz (47%)* |
| **Salmon** | 7g | 59 | 14 oz (41%)* | 20 oz (59%)* | 24 oz (71%)* |
| **Firm tofu** | 3g | 23 | 33 oz (38%)* | 47 oz (54%)* | 57 oz (66%)* |

*\*Percentages represent percent of total daily calories (assuming 2,000 cal/day target)*

### Per Meal Amounts (3 meals/day)

| Source | 100g target | 140g target | 170g target |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Chicken** | 4 oz (190 cal, 10%)* | 5-6 oz (260 cal, 13%)* | 7 oz (330 cal, 17%)* |
| **Salmon** | 5 oz (295 cal, 15%)* | 7 oz (415 cal, 21%)* | 8 oz (475 cal, 24%)* |
| **Firm tofu** | 11 oz (253 cal, 13%)* | 16 oz (368 cal, 18%)* | 19 oz (437 cal, 22%)* |

*\*Percentages represent percent of total daily calories (assuming 2,000 cal/day target)*

*Note: Silken tofu has ~half the protein of firm tofu - not practical as primary protein source.*

**Key:** Combine with resistance training 3-5x/week. Only 10% of GLP-1 users actually hit 1.6 g/kg target.

### Calorie Math for 2 lbs/week Weight Loss

**Parameters:** 190 lbs, lightly active

| Step | Calculation | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Maintenance calories | 190 lbs × ~16 cal/lb | ~3,000 cal/day |
| Deficit for 2 lbs/week | 2 lbs × 3,500 cal/lb ÷ 7 days | 1,000 cal/day deficit |
| **Daily calorie target** | 3,000 - 1,000 | **2,000 cal/day** |

**Protein as % of calories:**
- 140g protein × 4 cal/g = 560 cal = **28% of 2,000 cal budget**

**Meat calories vs remaining budget:**

| Protein Source | Meat calories | Remaining for other food |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Chicken (16 oz) | 750 cal | **1,250 cal** |
| Salmon (20 oz) | 1,180 cal | **820 cal** |

**Takeaway:** Chicken is more protein-efficient (~75% protein by calories) vs salmon (~48%). Salmon-heavy diet leaves less room for other foods.

## H3
### 2024-10-06  Whole Food Plant Based -ish diet.

- 16-8  Intermittent Fasting:  from 10-11a until 6-7pm.  (radishes later)

### 2022-12-12  Evening Eating - Hormones

HUNGER SIGNAL
- GHRELIN - Empty Tummy - 
- NPY - triggered when leptin is low for a period
- INSL-5 - INSULIN-LIKE PEPTIDE-5 - In colon

STOP SIGNAL
- LEPTIN - from fat cells / maintain energy balance - Berries/Bean/Greens
- CCK - Potatoes/Oatmeal - 
- NYY  & GLP-1 - Supresses appetite

- INSULIN - lowers glucose in blood by moving it to fat & muscle cells
- GLUCAGON - raises glucose in blood by converting glucagon to glucose 

IDEAS
- Heavy run
- Stretch tummy in evening -

Potassium to generate energy:  (especially root vegetables)
- potatoes
- parsnips
- beets
- onions
- butternut or acorn squash

Fruits. Fruits are also full of healthy nutrients, though they are higher in sugar, so you’ll want to be careful and limit them to about four to five servings/day. 
• banana
• orange
• apple
• dried figs
• dried apricots
• cranberries
• pineapple
• red grapes
• prunes (just one per day!)

Grains and nuts. 
• roasted almonds (~6-8/day), another source of potassium [2]
• sunflower seeds (1 tsp/day), a source of vitamin E [3]
• peanuts, a source of niacin and folate [4]
• ground flax (1 tbsp/day, best mixed in yogurt or peanut butter), a source of omega 3
• wild rice or whole grains (ideal because of less processing)

### 2019 Keto effect on Gut
-- bad Firmicutes.  good  Bacteroidetes 
   [The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes changed in favor of the Bacteroidetes in overweight](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19498350) 
-- short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)   good?   bad [was higer if obese](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19498350)
   Our results are in line with previous reports suggesting that SCFA metabolism might play a    
   considerable role in obesity. However, our results contradict previous reports with regard to the 
   contribution of various bacterial groups to the development of obesity;issue remains controversial.
   [is good](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/can-a-high-fat-diet-change-your-microbiome#High-fat-diet-affects-gut-bacteria)   This group includes beneficial bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids. These molecules help regulate inflammation in the body and protect the cells that line the intestines.
-- Plant polyphenols good.
-- resistant startch is good.  increases SCFA.
-- good (Akkermansia, Parabacteroides) [resistant starch good](https://lifeapps.io/nutrition/does-a-ketogenic-diet-change-our-microbiome/) Akkermansia are beneficial microbes that positively affect glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism and intestinal immunity. Parabacteroides can have anti-inflammatory effects. All of these bacteria can interact with our brain through our gut.  Editor’s note: Akkermansia and Parabacteroides are both enriched by dietary interventions involving resistant starches (plant fibers) and polyphenols such as those contained in berries. 
Kristie Rice passionate about keto

[It might be bad](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/can-a-high-fat-diet-change-your-microbiome#Many-factors-affect-gut-bacteria)     Dr. Martin Kriegel, professor of immunobiology  Yale School of Medicine

Its BAD:  http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/eating-for-a-trillion/   reference paper below:


https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4315779/
High-protein diets are thought to result in the production of carcinogenic metabolites from the colonic microbiota that may result in the induction of neoplasia in the colonic epithelium.

An increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and a reduction in the level of Bacteroidetes have been observed in both obese mice (44) and humans (45) although these findings have not been replicated in all studies (46–52).

Plant polyphenols have been associated with health benefits including anti-inflammatory, antiestrogenic, cardioprotective, chemoprotective, and neuroprotective effects (10).

#### Study on keto Children for seizures.  (shows negative effects)
[good bifido/longum/adoles were reduced](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-018-0073-2)
- The relative abundance of the genus Bifidobacterium was significantly decreased in patients after 3 months on KD.
- also reduction in good E. rectale
- Taxa believed to be health promoting (bifidobacteria and E. rectale) decrease in relative abundance and with them their health-promoting metabolites.

#### Magnesium & Potassium
[keto and drop these](https://www.hyperbiotics.com/blogs/recent-articles/optimize-your-keto-diet-by-focusing-on-your-gut-health)
• Focus on getting enough magnesium and potassium.

It can be particularly easy to let these two nutrients slide when you're on a keto diet, since they're commonly found in things like beans, potatoes, and bananas, but they're both really important for your gut to work properly. 
#### Omega-3s good
[Omega3 up microb diversity & help good guys hang on gut walls](https://www.hyperbiotics.com/blogs/recent-articles/optimize-your-keto-diet-by-focusing-on-your-gut-health)
And, all those good fats you're getting on the keto diet can be really beneficial to your gut microbiome, since healthy fats are good sources of omega-3s—and omega-3s are not only highly correlated with microbial diversity, but they also help beneficial bacteria adhere to your intestinal lining, giving them a leg up on the bad guys.12,13
#### Lato
[Lacto & Bifido good](https://www.hyperbiotics.com/blogs/recent-articles/optimize-your-keto-diet-by-focusing-on-your-gut-health)
Studies indicate that having a balanced microbiome rich in Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum can significantly support the way your body deals with glucose,

#### SCFA

[SCFA needed](https://www.hyperbiotics.com/blogs/recent-articles/optimize-your-keto-diet-by-focusing-on-your-gut-health)
Eating fewer carbs can be incredibly good for you––but one downside is that you may find it harder to get enough prebiotic fiber, since these types of fibers are commonly found in relatively carb-heavy foods, and it can be hard to find keto diet-friendly fiber.

And not getting enough prebiotics is a big problem, because your gut uses them to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are necessary for maintaining your energy, mood, brain function, and intestinal wall.7

Long story short: without enough SCFAs, you're probably not going to be feeling your best physically and mentally, which puts a big damper on the benefits you could be enjoying from your keto diet.8 But a healthy gut microbiome combined with prebiotic supplementation can help you avoid these effects, keeping you firing on all cylinders.
