# 16.08  Bottom Line Text
### Bottom Line (short)

Dan's Bottom Line (emailed to Alex on 8/22)

- A founder’s share of equity to match other key founders (like TC)

- $5M in cash over 4 years

- The same IP contract terms I negotiated with Bizzy

### Bottom Line (final)

                               MINIMUM COMPENSATION REQUREMENTS

MY BOTTOM LINE for my one year spent at Bizzy, plus more 4 years spent in the Combined company
is expressed in two parts, a lower risk (cash) portion and higher risk (equity) portion.

(a)   5% equity stake in CombinedCo  (this is equivalent to 1/5 of my current diluted equity in Bizzy)

(b)  $4M dollar total cash compensation for:  Bizzy Sale + 4/yr Salary   

(c)  $1M dollar cash compensation tied to bonuses.

     Cash represents my lowest risk compensation, thus it is crucial that a significant portion occurs immediately
     and that the majority is salary and proceeds from Bizzy purchases NOT just bonuses.

Bonus Milestone #1:  Entered Mass Production on our first product  (currently a Robotic system for the US market)
Bonus Milestone #2:  Entered Mass Production on our second product  (currently a Robot system for the Asian market)
Requirements for Bonus Milestones:
-- must only focus on over comming TECHNICAL hurdles (which I can control), not on over comming MARKET hurdles (which I cannot control)
-- must only target technical goals already planned for today.

(d) We use the already negotiated IP contract agreements with Bizzy to serve as my IP agreements with the Combined Company.
    (Note:  these will be assigned to the Combined Co in the purchase of Bizzy.  Agreements include my PIIA, TAA, and NDA agreements)

=====================
NOTES ON MY THINKING ABOUT MY BOTTOM LINE


TRADING SOME OF MY EQUITY FOR CASH:
Investors expect many billions of dollars from this company, so for them each 1% of equity is worth a 
a risk-adjusted, diluted fraction of many $10M chunks in today's dollars.  I have less experience here, 
and I am more risk averse, so each 1% percent is worth far less than this large sum to me personally.
Therefore it is win-win for us to trade some of my equity for cash.


SALARY AND UP FRONT CASH:
For me the worst outsome is not technical failure.  Of course that is terrible, but at least that is MY fault.
The worst outcome is after many, many years of my life:  A TECHNICAL success BY ME occurs, but somehow it
does not lead to a FINANCIAL success FOR me.
Thus is is **CRUCIAL** that:
(1) A significant portion of my compensation is listed in the contract explicitly as US dollar amounts.
(2) Some significant piece of my cash compensation occur at the very beginning.


CONTROL
The larger the entity, the less total control I have over our technical success.  Thus
the more important that most of my lower risk cash compensation is tied *ONLY*
to my personal continued value to the company as measured by my continued employment.

### Bottom Line (before)
Alex:

I am not quite sure where your “crazy idea” is going…  I am assuming as single company:-)??  Anyway, I would be open to trading away some of my upside equity potential for a more certain payout.

If i were paid a market rate salary (somewhere under a million, but really getting up there), and I have enough percents in the company to have a "founder like" pay day, when the company exits, then I am in!

— I should somehow keep equivalent vesting that I already have at bizzy, and
     would want a scheme that was linear…  i.e. I am accruing salary/equity each month.

— I am pretty picky about being able to continue owning IP & doing my own research & work
     (unrelated to Bizzy)

If that stuff was covered I would be pretty happy.


But I am still hopeful that we can figure out a way to save our current situation.


Cheers,
Dan

# 16.08  Combine Combined Co 
## David's note

I would really count on you to provide me the contract ASAP. I hope we
can decide the contract terms only one run of discussion, otherwise,
we might miss the golden window. I give you my whole trust to provide
me a fair contract. Please do remember to put signature whoever could
represent Bizzy.  I am open to invest either one company or two
companies for this robot business as long as you could deliver the
robot to the market timely. However, I only study the solution you are
really convinced. Please decide your path before I talk to all
investors.
 
Best regards,
David
 
## Joe's Text


Structure:
 
Purchase of existing company: 1/7 of the purchase price to David for
the note (approx 14.3%), remaining allocated to common stock holders
in proportion to their stock.  Purchase price: Fair market value
 
20% of new company's stock allocated to Bizzy's former employees.
Shared Dan/Alex/Joe/Employees in same proportion as existing Bizzy
stock proportions.  (NOTE TO DAN: If they get rid of me it's bad that
I'm taking a larger share since it's wasted.  But its hard to see how
to allocate to all employees proportional to previous share other than
me.  Doing a new allocation now where I get less puts me in a tough
position where I'm forced to push back.  I think this is the lesser of
the evils, but I'm open to ideas).
 
Significant cash bonus for Bizzy employees (particularly founders) for
shipping product.  This coupled with vesting in new company stock will
keep everyone on board as long as designed correctly.
 
Since upside is largely gone, market salary.
 
=================
 
NOTES TO DAN: 

1.  See how there isn't a number for the price of the company.  This
    avoids sticker shock and a lot of argument right now.  They should
    have no issue with "fair market value".

2.  The 20% of new company stock after us cashing out of the old
    company isn't fair to them since the Taiwan standard seems to be
    that 20% of a company goes to the founders.  So the fair number is
    that we split 10% for Bizzy common shareholders, not 20%.  But 20%
    is a great place to start negotiations.

3.  Combination of 20% stake, big cash bonus for delivery, and market
    salary is not fair to them either.  TC is getting 1/2 market
    salary, and I think if they buy that you and I are worth $700K+
    salary that we should settle for half market too, assuming the
    delivery bonus is big, which they should be super-happy to do.
    Again, I'm fine with starting with this negotiation position,
    although I think this is the one that feels greedy, and I think is
    incompatible with their goals (if we make a great salary now the
    incentive for delivering is greatly muted).

## Response 
### Extras 1

   It would not be appropriate for us to then use these as anchor points for incremental negotiations, 
   If we begin negotiating any one of these numbers down we should negotiate other numbers up in compensation  (which we are hoping to avoid).
   If you like I can also add a hard number for the value of Bizzy as well

   10M * 25% * 6/7




=======================================

### Big David Note

David:
You asked me to provide my single best choice as a contract for the investors to consider.
-- I think a single company solution is the best path (see WHY ONE COMPANY below).
-- I think trading Bizzy for cash is the best path (see BIZZY FOR CASH below).

-- In good faith I have tried to put hard numbers into this contract in hopes of a
  ``one shot'' contract discussion as you requested.

-- Joe is currently the only officer of Bizzy so he must sign any contract.  
   Joe agreed to the terms described below.  We trimmed them to a concise contract that he was willing to sign.

-- Alex also urged me to write down my bottom line for you, if you know my bottom line, you can find the best way to achieve it.
(5) The already negotiated Bizzy IP related agreements will be assigned to CombinedCo and will 
serve as the IP agreements for Employees in CombinedCo.  (The PIIA, TAA, and NDA for each Bizzy employee)
    
My personal bottom line for one year spent at Bizzy, plus 4 years spent in CombinedCo is expressed in two parts:
a lower risk (cash) portion and higher risk( equity) portion.
>>  $5M dollar total cash compensation for:  Bizzy Sale + 4/yr Salary + 2 Milestone Bonuses       
      (See see EXPLICIT AND UP FRONT CASH below.  Also it is crucial, if there is negotiation, we only negotiation UP from this number.)
>>  5% equity stake in CombinedCo  (this is equivelant to 1/5 of my current diluted equity in Bizzy)



MY THINKING:

WHY ONE COMPANY:  When I consider the investor's perspective, I see it is too dangerous to allow an 
independent Bizzy.  They are risking much more than $20M dollars, and they have no good recovery solution
if at some point Bizzy does not cooperate well.  Also, most IP value is generated inside Bizzy.  This is not fair.


WHY BIZZY FOR CASH:  Trading the fair estimated value built up in Bizzy against the fair estimation of 
value built into TaiwanCo will result in Bizzy employees owning too much equity in TaiwanCo.  
Providing fair trade of equity built up in Bizzy.


FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR BIZZY
Just so we have a crisply defined contract, I used $2M estimate as the value created since the november investment,
plus the post seed investment valuation of $8M dollars.   NOTE:  I chose an extremely conservative estimate of the 
created value to avoid any negotiation on this purchase price.


TRADING SOME OF MY EQUITY FOR CASH:
Investors expect many billions of dollars from this company, so for them each 1% of equity is worth a 
a risk-adjusted, diluted fraction of many $10M chunks in today's dollars.  I have less experience here, 
and I am more risk averse, so each 1% percent is worth far less than this large sum to me personally.
>>  Therefore it is win-win for us to trade some of my equity for cash.


FOUR YEAR VESTING AND CLIFF:
Since Bizzy founder have received value for their Bizzy vesting as sale of Bizzy in Cash, it is appropriate 
that new equity begins with new standard 4 year vesting with a standard 1 year cliff at the date of merging.


EXPLICIT AND FRONT CASH:
For me the worst outsome is not technical failure.  Of course that is terrible, but at least that is MY fault.
The worst outcome is after many, many years of my life:  A TECHNICAL success BY ME occurs, but somehow it
does not lead to a FINANCIAL success FOR me.

The more diluted my direct control of the system become, the more scared I become.
And honestly this crazy contracting process over the last months is really scared me too.
It  and lets me know that I am too inexperienced to really have wisdom here.
    
Thus is is **CRUCIAL** that:
 (1) A significant portion of my compensation is listed in the contract explicitly as US dollar amounts.
 (2) Some significant piece of my cash compensation occur at the very beginning.



==============================================================
DETAILS FOR THE CONTRACT FOR MERGING OF BIZZY INTO COMBINED CO

(1) CombinedCo makes a cash purchase of Bizzy Inc. at fair market value.     (See BIZZY FOR CASH and FAIR MARKET VALUE above)
-- Fair market value is $10M 
-- 1/7 of this fair market value price is allocated to David Lin for his investment note (approx 14.3%), The remaining cash is
    allocated to common stock holders in proportion to the stock issued to them. 

(2) Bridge Financing.  Investor will provide financing of $250K for ongoing 
operations of  Bizzy and this amount will be deducted from the purchase 
price of Bizzy.

(3) CombineCo Equity Awarded to Bizzy Employees      (See FOUR YEAR VEST AND CLIFF)
Since Bizzy equity has been compensated, Any employees that CombinedCo chooses to retain will be issued new equity with the standard 4 year vesting
and 1 year cliff beginning at their joining of CombinedCo.
-- Non-founder employees will have their equity in CombinedCo adjusted so their ratio relative to the sum of Alex+Joe+Dan remains the same as they 
transition from Bizzy to CombinedCo equity.

(4) Cash Compensation
-- Dan Oblinger.    $500K/year salary  +  $500K cash bonus at milestone #1  +  $500K cash bonus paid at milestone #2     
                    (bonuses are adjusted up or down in order to make Dan total cash including sale of bizzy be $5M)
-- Joe Augenbraun.  (Joe makes his own request here)
-- Alex Huang.      (Alex negotiates his own request here)
-- Existing bizzy employees will receive their current salaries, including the increases that were 
   promised to them once Bizzy had raised money.
-- Milestone #1:  Mass Production release of our first robot w. our software
-- Milestone #2:  Sales revenue exceeds $100M within a 12 months for robot systems with our software

(5) The already negotiated Bizzy IP related agreements will be assigned to CombinedCo and will 
serve as the IP agreements for Employees in CombinedCo.  (The PIIA, TAA, and NDA for each Bizzy employee)
    

DEFINITIONS:
-- All cash amounts are in US dollars.
-- "TaiwanCo" refers to the taiwanese entity with $16M invested in to it, and with the IP produced by TC's team.
-- "CombinedCo" refers to the future entity that results from the combination of Bizzy Inc. and TaiwanCo.
-- "Our Software" refers to any software developed for robotic systems by either the former Bizzy employees 
   or other CombineCo employees.
   






















A personal compensation package that would achieve my base/immediate finacial goals, as well as focusing me on our success  would achieve my minimum lower my equity in favor of a higher salary.
-- $800K per year salary.
-- My equity set at 5%  (½ of the level that TC is set)
    --  with the same earn out clause if there is not exit within a define period)
-- 
-- 

-- In my opinion having a silicon valley based division of TaiwanCo
    is of significant value.
-- I believe both Joe and Alex provide significant value

### Joes Response Text


There seemed to be a deal that makes a lot of sense for everyone:
1.  It is one company that is majority owned by the investors
2.  Current founders of Bizzy get a founder share of the single company (this share is of course smaller than the share they have now of Bizzy)
3.  There is an up front purchase price for Bizzy that goes to the founders now
4.  Bizzy founders get market salary
5.  Bizzy founders get a big cash bonus for shipping the robot (this will make sure the founders stay and work very hard)





# 16.06  Software License idea

David, 

Based on our call I decided to try to write up a simple License that might work for Bizzy and Volante.  
Should I share this with Alex and see if it can be helpful in reaching an agreement?


CONTRACT TERM — 5 years
5 years contract from date of signing.



BASIC TERMS — Volante pays a flat royalty on revenue.
Volante would pay a Royalty for all revenue generated from or associated with robotic systems 
using the Bizzy software.



MOST FAVORED NATION STATUS — Volante always gets the best deal
Volante would always receive the better of the basic terms above and any other terms that Bizzy 
provides to  any other partner for any Bizzy software.



SHARING THE FRUITS — Both Volante and Bizzy each adapt their stuff free of charge
- Bizzy agrees to provide its software for volante’s robotic systems, and to perform localization 
  of that software for Volante’s usage without charge.
- Volante agrees to develop a robotic system according to Bizzy’s specifications with out charge.



COMPETITION AVOIDANCE — We avoid or manage direct competition.
The space of applications and markets for the bizzy+volante solutions is vast.  Thus Bizzy and Volante 
agree to negotiate on an ongoing basis to avoid or manage direct competition.



GOOD FAITH -- Both parties need to operate in good faith in order for the contract to remain intact.
 For Example:  Neither party can argue they own all markets, 
               Bizzy must provide effective support for their software
               Volante must provide a robot at a usable cost and performance, etc.

# 16.06  Legal   (for signing the PIIA)
#### Legal words

(1) I am assigning all i did on bizzy platform to bizzy.

    The work done for Bizzy Inc. is all materials provided by any electronic, printed, written or verbal means 
    to the company including all source code in the Github repository, all presentations, designs, documenation
    and plans.


    For the avoidance of doubt no part of the Uniform or Lex langaguages are included in this assignement.
    In the case of any incidental inclusion of materials relating to these languages Bizzy is given
    an unlimited licence for use of that material.

#### Plain Text Intent

toslovar@omm.com

=====
SAID IN REVERSE:

Dan assigns all future work to Bizzy except: 
  (1) Things that do not relate to Bizzy's buisness at time of conception or reduction to practice
  (2) NDA client matters
  (3) Technologies listed in (or added w. approval to) exhibit A.
  (4) Further development on items in exhibit A
        provided that further development does not result from work performed by Dan for Bizzy
  
======
Here is the plain English version of what I understand is the business agreement:

Dan assigns to Bizzy any inventions that (1) are related to Bizzy's
demonstrable business at the time of conception or reduction to practice of
the invention, or (2) result from any work performed by Dan for Bizzy.

Exceptions:
1) Anything that falls under CA Sec. 2870
2) Any client-related matter related to New Dawn Analytics, Inc.
3) Any further development of the technologies listed on Exhibit A, 
   provided that they do not result from any work performed by Dan for Bizzy.


The assignment is essentially the scope of Sec. 2870 once you strip away the
time and equipment prongs. The exceptions are needed to protect your other
disclosed interests. There can't be an overlap on your assignments between
NDA and Bizzy - we're happy to limit the exception to client related work,
though. As for the development of the other technologies, as long as it
doesn't proceed from your work at Bizzy, the developments need to remain
yours.

Without expanding the scope of assigned Technology, the Developer and Company agree that the following 
are not developed for the Company's buisness:  Work done for or relating to New Dawn Analytics/Analytics Fire, 
the Uniform and Lex languages, and Marketplace based on those langauges, the book ``Engines of Control,'' 
and Notester.

Q2


QUESTION #2 -- It seems this agreement (with original text is section A) gives everything I have ever created since birth to the Company.
               All the company needs to do is to make its future buisness relate to that thing.
               This seems perposterous.  

Q2 answer: Perhaps it seems preposterous, but that is what it says, and it
is standard "starting point" language! So, we need to modify as appropriate.


##### David's response II

Hi Dan, responses inline-

DAN: It seems to me that if I remove the OR RELATING TO phrase, then as
their text is written I am only giving to Bizzy that which I developed for
Bizzy.

DAVE: That's right. If you develop something for someone else for yourself,
it belongs to you.

QUESTION #1:  In that case it seems I could remove  [OR FOR HIS OWN
PURPOSES] from your section with safety.

DAVE: I wouldn't - I think it is an important clarification.

QUESTION #2:  Going even further it seems I could remove all of section (i)
from your text with relative safety.
this might yield something like the sentence below.  (please edit, if using
this more limited form could make sense.)

DAVE: Again, I wouldn't. It is best to be crystal clear as to who owns what.


Best, Dav

##### David's response I

i Dan,

Q1 answer: The "now existing" language modifies the "right, title and
interest" clause, not the definition of what is assigned. In other words it
says that for any technology that exists as of this date, you assign all
right title and interest in the same, even if that right, title or interest
doesn't exist yet. For example, if you wrote a piece of code, you assign
that today. If, subsequent to signing this, you register a copyright in the
code, you also assign that registered copyright interest in the code. But if
you write code in the future, that code is not assigned.

Q2 answer: Perhaps it seems preposterous, but that is what it says, and it
is standard "starting point" language! So, we need to modify as appropriate.

Q3 answer: You could do that, but if it were a close call that it related to
the Company's business it still might not protect you, and it is an awful
lot of effort to go to rather than re-drafting the definition of what is
assigned. The solution, as discussed, is to redraft the definition of what
is assigned. Which brings us to Q4:

Q4 answer: Both of those are better, A being better than B. You could also
take out the "relating to" language. That way, it is only work that you
developed with an intention towards Bizzy that is assigned, rather than
something that coincidentally relates to their business.

Q5 answer: You could use this statement:

The following shall not constitute Technology:
(i) any business plans, technical information, inventions, software,
algorithms, processes and technology ("Inventions") that was created or
developed by Developer for either another employer or for his own purposes,
without regard to the Company; and
(ii) without limiting the generality of subsection (i) above, any Inventions
created for or relating to New Dawn Analytics/Analytics Fire, the Uniform
syntax, the Lex language, Cloud Config, the book Engines of Control, and
Notester.

Hope that help. I can discuss tomorrow or Friday  - let me know a few times
that work.

Best, Dave

As I read the TAA it seems that it might be worded to be both BACKWARD AND FORWARD facing.  Section 1 starts:
    1. Assignemnt
    The Developer herby assigns the Company exclusively throughout the world, all right, title and interest (WHETHER OR NOT NOW EXISTING) in the: (i) subject matter referred to in Exhibit A (the "Technology"); (ii) all precursors ...


QUESTION #1 -- It seems the intention is to assign all Technology developed in the past or future.  is that correct, or a possible interpretation?

QUESTION #2 -- It seems this agreement (with original text is section A) gives everything I have ever created since birth to the Company.
               All the company needs to do is to make its future buisness relate to that thing.
               This seems perposterous.  

QUESTION #3 -- The only exception to #2 seems to be if some other entity already owns the stuff.
               Seems crazy, but I could create an LLC that is 25% owned by my Father, and assign everything
               I have ever done to that LLC.  This would kind of operate as if a separate corporation owned this stuff.


====
Joe persuasively argues that the "delivered" language is too strong.
I was looking at the text and imagined two edits one could make to the original text:

ORIGINAL
   Technology includes all buisness plans, technical information, inventions, software, algorithms, processes and technology￼
   created or developed, in whole or in part, by the Developer for or relating to the Company's current and future buisness.
   Technology also includes all rights the Developer may have in trademarks, trade names and internet domains used by the Company.


DAN EDIT (A) -- remove [AND FUTURE]
  created or developed, in whole or in part, by the Developer for or relating to the Company's current [AND FUTURE] buisness,
  [THAT RELATES TO THE ROBOTICS INDUSTRY]


DAN EDIT (B) -- add [THAT RELATES TO THE ROBOTICS INDUSTRY]
  created or developed, in whole or in part, by the Developer for or relating to the Company's current and future buisness,
  [THAT RELATES TO THE ROBOTICS INDUSTRY]



QUESTION #4 -- It seems I should be ok with either?  Both limit what they are getting to some scope.



====
QUESTION #5 -- what text would I add to explicitly exclude my current work?
Here was what I was imagining, but you can provide the actual text.


For clarity of intent, Technology does not include any of the following:

New Dawn Analytics / Analytics Fire work
The Uniform syntax
The Lex language
Cloud Config
The book Engines of Control
Notester and related personal info manager ideas

Q2 answer: Perhaps it seems preposterous, but that is what it says, and it
is standard "starting point" language! So, we need to modify as appropriate.

#### Second Email to David

Things have progressed on the Licencing front.  I have become convinced that any licencing that I might 
provide to Bizzy could really hurt me in the long run, since as a founder of Bizzy I might be forced to 
accept changes that could confuse my subsequent ownership of my own IP.

So my new plan is to try to separate Bizzy IP from my IP as far as possible.
this seems easily done except for assumptions about working place and working times.


====
Right now I work around the clock for both Bizzy and on my own stuff.
It is difficult to separate the times and places for this work.

Part of my job at Bizzy is to be the cheerleader for the team.  So I am the first one into work, and the last one
to leave.  I also work early morinings and late nights in order to connect with our international team.
All of this is fine w. me, but it is fine, since I can intersperse NewDawnAnalytics and person stuff into this time.

I want to ensure that if I work of my stuff 
  (a) at work or
  (b) during hours that are typically working hours
I am not putting my IP at risk.

====
So how do I do this?  Specifically how do I do this in a way that seems most "ok" for a potential investor?
I think your text below works as I asekd, but may freak out investors:

    I will be working on Company time and premises and possibly
    using Company equipment on my other business activities, and these items
    will not be assigned to the Company unless they demonstrably relate to my
    duties to the Company at the time of their creation and I have actually
    delivered them to the Company.


I have spoken to Joe (my CEO and co-founder about this).  His comment is that ``you are working night and 
day, so there is not reason you cannot be doing your own stuff during normal biz hours, or at work.''

He thinks I am safe as things stand.  I am not convinced I am safe.  and yet I worry that this will blow up when 
I try to document it for investors.


====
Proposed direction:

-- Sign the TAA, and founder agreement.  Be sure that the TAA lists my current IP in "Attachment A" where you lists such stuff.
-- Work on my stuff sometimes during working hours, but not on company equipment, nor on premisis.

If I do this, assuming a standard PIAA, am I safe?
-- Do I need specific langauge in the PIAA to protect my ongoing work?
   (for example saying that I am still working on my other company and other stuff, or is that 



QUESTIONS:
-- In a standard CIAA, if I continue working on a conflict listed in the TAA, do I clearly keep that new IP?
   How are stanard contractor PIAA's created?

-- If our company has a flexible working hours policy + email with the Joe/Alex co-founder/board members stating that
   I will be using the flex in order to work on my own stuff, am I covered?

-- Does that email need to specfically mention work place ?

-- If any of these stuff explodes on me, I am prepared to leave Bizzy over the issue, 
   but I would rather not risk that explosion now


======
Tighten TAA
-- exhibit A:
   and delivered to the company for buisness of the company "Robotics"

#3 everything related to buizzy is their excluded things not getting assigned:  NDA, Lex
#2 be specific about what is in scope
#1 delivered.


this is fine with me, but a central consideration for this is being able to 


Honestly I don't want to draw attention to work I am doing on both sides

Instead I am now aiming to separate that IP from Bizzy as far as possible, while preserving my ability to work
on it during the time that I am at Bizzy.  Our plan is to:
-- list that my IP is exempted.
-- and also somehow state that I retain ownership of work I do on my own during my employment at Bizzy.  Specifically
   work not delivered to bizzy, 
   work which is not robotic-specific, 
   work not done for Bizzy
   work is for NDA (new dawn analytics)
   work that extends my current projects.

#### DanO Notes

MAIN GOAL: BOTH BIZZY AND DAN ARE NOT ENCUMBERED.
--  BIZZY-OWNS -- Bizzy owns all that I deliver to bizzy (unless explicitly licenced otherwise)
--  SELF-OWNERSHIP  --  I own the non-robotic-related work that I do.
--  INCIDENTAL OVERLAPS -- Bizzy and Dan are given licence to use & build upon conceptual overlaps.  
    (shared code should be controlled by explicit licencing -- this refers
    to conceptual overlap.
--  NO-AUTO-ASSIGNMENT  --  NDA related work; my own non-robotic language/application work
    --  Work making usage of Bizzy resources (working hours, executed in space rented by bizzy)
        is owned by Bizzy on in the case that it satisfies conditions above.

BIZZY USES DAN'S TECH
--  Bizzy Corp has a licence to the Uniform syntax and aspects of the Lex language as released 
    by Dan Oblinger to Bizzy Corporation.

   This licence affords bizzy unlimited rights to:
   --  Use utilize the released source code and languages within the context of robotic systems.
   --  Utilizing includes rights to, modify, licence others, 
   --  "context of robotic systems" means directly within the depolyed robotic system, as
       well as within the reserach and developement of such robotic systems.


-- Get David's assessement of my doc.
-- Get CIIA from Joe
   update w. language: Bizzy gets all IP produced by Dan
       --1--  specific to the Robotic Systems being developed at Bizzy
       --2--  related to Robotics
       --     Bizzy also gets an unlimited licence to use anything incidenally provided to Bizzy by Dan
       --     Work making usage of Bizzy resources (working hours, executed in space rented by bizzy)
              is owned by Bizzy on in the case that it satisfies conditions above.

#### David's text
#################

In connection with my relationship with Bizzy Robots, Inc. (the "Company"),
I understand that I will eventually be asked to sign a form of invention
assignment agreement. I am happy to do so, but in the meantime I want to be
clear about our agreement related to the following items.

I will only be assigning the inventions and intellectual property that I generate that 
  (i) relates to the Company's business, i.e., robotics, and
  (ii) that I actually deliver to the Company (each such invention, a "Company Invention"). 

I will be working on Company time and premises and possibly
using Company equipment on my other business activities, and these items
will not be assigned to the Company unless they demonstrably relate to my
duties to the Company at the time of their creation and I have actually
delivered them to the Company.

On Schedule A below is a non-exhaustive list of my pre-existing inventions
which, for the avoidance of doubt, I am not assigning to the Company. To the
extent that I incorporate into a Company Invention either a pre-existing
invention or an invention that I create outside of the scope of my
responsibilities as described in the paragraph above, the Company shall have
a nonexclusive, royalty-free, paid-up, irrevocable, worldwide license (with
the full right to sublicense) to make, have made, modify, use, sell, offer
for sale and import such invention. Such inventions shall remain my property
including any modifications that I make to the same during the term of my
relationship with the Company, unless such modifications relate exclusively
to the context of robotics, in which case such modifications (but not the
underlying invention) shall become the property of the Company.

Schedule A
LEX Language
UNIFORM Language
[Dan - please list any others]

#########################

Hopefully that works for now, but again, it would be ideal to actually
resolve this my working on the PIAA. Let me know any questions or comments.

Best, Dave

#### Short Summary

Licencing Agreement
   --     Dan provides a 'unlimited' usage licencing for the language work Dan delivers to Bizzy (including parts of the LEX and UNIFORM langauges).
   --     Dan continues to own extesnions he develops on these languages during the Bizzy contract that are not specific to the Robotic usage context.
   --     In consideration for this usage licence, Bizzy allows Dan unlimited usage of extensions to 
          these languages developed by Bizzy (as long as the extensions are not robotic specific)

#### Email to david


======
David, 
I am signing as a founder for a Robotics startup.
As always it seems the IP considerations are the most thorny.
I will write about those in a subsequent note.


FOUNDER CONTRACT:
Included is the proposed contract from Bizzy, the claim is that this
is the same contract being signed by the other two founders.

I generally trust these guys, but not at the level that I trust Nick  (which is a whole lot).
So what is the right kind of diligence on this?  Also is it better for us to try to write our own?
It is probably better for Bizzy Robotics if they have the same kinds of agreements w. all founders.


IP AGREEMENT:
Probably separate from the founder agreement will be some documentation regarding IP.
Here are the issues related to IP:

(1) KEEPING MY IP -- I will continue to work w. Nick, and work on my own stuff too.
    I want to be sure that this work does not accidentally get owned or somehow encumbered by Bizzy.
    Perhaps we can structure this something like a consultant's IP agreement where they only own what I deliver?

(2) SHARING IP -- A further complication is that some of my own language developement work is relevant for Bizzy.
    I am happy to give Bizzy unlimited rights to use this stuff, but I want to be careful that do not loose any 
    control.
    HERE IS MY INITIAL IDEAS ABOUT THIS:   

   -- IP Terms 
      -- styled after a consulting agreement:  
         -- That which I deliver to Bizzy is bizzy's.  That which I do not deliver is mine, or owned Analytics Fire or others.
      -- I am licencing my Uniform and Lex languages as delivered for unlimited usage within the Robotic context
         in consideration for this, I continue to own extensions and updates to the languages which are general purpose (not specific to robotic system)
      -- Dan grant's Bizzy a licence for anything that incidentally is incorporated thru his action into Bizzy systems.
      -- Bizzy does not gain any rights of Dan's IP on the basis of incidental usage of Bizzy time or Resource.
         e.g. work during working ours or in a bizzy paid space, etc.



===========
Bizzy Corp has a licence to the Uniform syntax and aspects of the Lex language as released 
by Dan Oblinger to Bizzy Corporation.

This licence affords bizzy unlimited rights to:

-- Use utilize the released source code and languages within the context of robotic systems.

-- Utilizing includes rights to, modify, licence others, 

-- "context of robotic systems" means directly within the depolyed robotic system, as
   well as within the reserach and developement of such robotic systems.





==============

      -- The aim is for both Dan and Bizzy to be able to use and extend, etc. the delivered 

      -- IP around building robotic systems is Bizzy's as are all things I DELIVER to bizzy
         that which you do not deliver to bizzy is not bizzy's
      -- plus a term that says anything that incidendally is used by bizzy is granted an unlimited licence to utilize
         (so there are no risks that somehow I could own something as leverage over bizzy)
      -- plus an explicit carveout for Uniform and Lex


    -- both sides have unlimited rights to use the common IP
    -- 



    -- INCEDENTAL USAGE OF BIZZY RESORUCES  (e.g. working on some aspect of my other contracts while physically at bizzy office) 
      -- Understanding that if I do work associated with Analytics Fire (or other activities) 
         this does not affect ownership even if it occurs during buisness hours or at bizzy location.
         (I won't be using bizzy resources)
    -- ANY WORK DONE at the level
    -- ANY IMPROVEMENTS TO MY LANGUAGE made by NDA in service of Bizzy, are owned by NDA





-- Shares / Vesting March-1 / F-shares

-- Salary:  comparable to Joe's

-- Title / Responsiblity:  
   CTO/VP engineering with immediate backfill of a Directory of Engineering
   And likely transition to CTO only as company grows



Discussion around title / reponsibility

-- In these early months I feel arriving at unified motion is very difficult.
   We are making and editing our path once a day (or soemtimes more often) along each thread
   this is both aided (and impeded) by having a single center for our execution.

-- So *immediately* we will be better off having a director of engineering who is 
   mentally fused with me, on an hour-by-hour basis.  Maybe Sean is this guy, maybe not,
   but I feel it is important that this person is in lock step on an hour by hour basis,
   as hour thinking evolves.

-- This single center model will fall apart in the coming months, both because
   the team size will grow beyond a single center kind of model.  AND the 
   need for a single center will also go down.  Each of our many pieces will become
   more mature, and will become more separated as they grow more defined.

   At this time there needs to be a second center.  That person is NOT in hour-by-hour
   lock step with the architect.  They don't need to be.  At the same time, they
   are maximizing the delivery of 20+ engieers.  

-- At a personal level it is valuable to take on the mantle of VP of engineering:
   both as a way to grow in skill and in order to be recognized for having those skills.
   I was the VP of Eng at Pay By Group, but that is a smaller/less technical venture

-- Also if I am actually doing the work, I'd like the title that matches it.

-- But this is a short lived time.  I will die if I keep this pace, I will 


=========


  -- IP agreement like a consultant agreement.
  -- IP -- agreed that work I do for Bizzy is all bizzys
        -- work I did prior to bizzy is mine to use;
           but if I deliver/use it at bizzy, then bizzy has rights to use it
        -- specifically other research including but not limited to my configuration / info managment 
           models of learning etc.
 -- 2mo on

TC/Alex:



COMPENSATION CONSIDERATIONS

- Above is my understanding of the Cap table for the relevant employees.  
  (I pulled this from our shared founder folder, that you have access to Alex.
   We should verify these percentages with Joe, since I am trusting I am seeing the most recent/correct document here.)

- I added Alex and Dan's conversion for comparison.

- According to my reasoning equity in Bizzy @7M cap with $1M invested would be diluted by a factor of TWO
  after having a $5M and then $12M rounds required to achieve the $16-20M investment that Aeolus will have.

- I think a 50% premium for the simplicity of having equity in the parent company... the same company as the manufactures 
  is a WIN for the employees.  This would cause each equity to be divided by /3 as I showed above.

- Alex suggested it should be a 100% preimum for having that same equity as the manufactures.
  This would be a /4 calculation.  And this would save about 1/2 percent in total equity.
  I believe this equity position can also be supported, but I think there will be room for Joe in particular 
  to argue back to the team that this is not fair to them.  (I don't know if he will do this or not.)

- So this is a strategy question.  I feel if we come in with a /3 number, we are in a very strong position to
  simply say that this is a very fair deal, and there should be no negotiation.  If we choose the /4 number 
  I feel we need to be more open to negotiation.

  I do not have a strong opinion about which approach is best, but I do we want our first offer to be one that is pretty good
  so we don't begin our disussions in a place where they feel they have lost ground.
  (if they push for other concessions or such, I would recommend that we consider those concessions but make it clear that we
   need to reduce their equity in compensation for that.)

- HEALTH CARE -- for those in the US, there will be an expectation of having health care.  Bizzy had good health care thru
  blue-cross.  Joe will be able to provide details on this, but I believe that we were paying multiple hundred dollars per employee per month for that.
  We should be clear on what we will be providing in this area, so they do not see this as area of confusion in our offer.

- Consultant vs. Employee
  It will matter to some employees whether they are an employee or contractor.  Our international folks are curently contractors
  so we can keep things that way, but we will want to be able to say something about what the future holds in the regard.

- SEVERIN
  If you notice.  Severin has ZERO equity in the company.  In my experience, folks in Silicon Valley know the value of equity,
  and they will demand it.  Folks who are international do not value equity, and they are more salary sensitive, AND they have
  lower total salary requirements since their economies are not as strong.

  Thus (I had to push Joe on this), I favor NOT providing equity as a starting point for these folks... it is not clear over
  time if we can maintain this separation.  I had not yet come to any conclusion about that.  I do like having people having
  equity, so they are committed to the company, but it is a waste when they don't value that equity.

  The primary issue we have now is that this call could make it very clear to Severin that he is the ONLY one without equity.
  I think we can avoid having any discussion about exact equity numbers on the call, so we could provide severin with *some*
  equity in Aeolus.  

  My idea
