## EDU CORP ADVANTAGES

The Edu Corp structure has significant advantages over micro loans & vocational schools 

### Advantages For The Student
- **NEARLY GUARANTEES A JOB** - Unless asked to leave or entire school fails, a student is guaranteed a job at the school at least, and if the market supports business creation, they are guaranteed to be part of any created business.  These guarantees are far far better than anything provided with a microloan or by an vocational school.

- **GREATER COMPANY STABILITY** - 
	- Starting with current training and customers - .
	- Franternity of Schools - allows creation of multi-school shared branding, marketing, etc. affording many "big co" advantages to smaller orgs.

### Advantages For The Funding Source
- **FUNDS ARE AT DRAMATICALLY LOWER RISK** - Structurally much lower risk repayment-failure or project-failure risk because:
	- **Like a business expansion loan** - since school is sharing workers, assets, and client, the "new" business is more the much lower risk case of expanding a successful business.
- **Very knowledgeable/motivated "loan officer"** - loans are co-signed by classmates who are (1) in your business, (2) who know you intimately, and (3) will pay dearly if your loan failure.
- **Much more committed recipient** - Student has little loyalty to a faceless investor, but great loyalty to the friends that trusted and trained them.
- **MORE PEOPLE HELPED WITH LESS MONEY SPENT** - Much more than all other systems, Edu Corp ensures that successful graduates work TIRELESSLY to ensure underclassman success.  Lowers the cost of training, upfront costs to acquire customers, etc.  This means every dollar given to Edu Corp can be greatly amplified.

 
FIRST SELF-DRIVING MODEL OF POST CAPITALISM
- Dollars Drive Capitalism - Capital enlists and leverages labor for maximal profit back to capital and minimal benefit back to labor.  (This is the STATED objective of a corporation!)
- Network of People Drive Edu Corp - x Stated objective of the network is to spread benefit to as many as possible, and minimize individual failures from the network.





## PROPERTIES OF AN IDEAL EDU CORP BUSINESS


BUSINESS PROPERTIES THAT MAKE THE EDU CORP MODEL WORK
This are requirements for a business to be considered for the Edu Corp model.  Edu Corp is creating a self-sustaining "wave" of businesses that create other businesses.  The nature of the wave itself places certain constraints on the kind of businesses that can be made to fit; they are listed here:

- 2-6 YEAR PAYBACK - Profits from the business, once it is up and running, need to be sufficient to pay off the progression loans required to start that business.  The longer this period is, the slower the whole Edu Corp mechanism is, and the more likely markets will change in a way that causes some businesses to fail before they can even pay back their loans.kj
- REPEATABLE - d 
- PEER-TO-PEER TAUGHT - d 
BUSINESS PROPERTIES THAT REQUIRE THE EDU CORP MODEL 
If a business type could easily be created without the advantages afforded by the Edu Corp model, then one needs to question why these businesses don't already exist.  And in any case, there is little reason to introduce the complexity of the Edu Corp model if that complexity is not gaining crucial advantage on at least some of these aspects that benefit from the Edu Corp model.


- LABOR INTENSIVE - The primary value that the student brings is their labor
- ON JOB TRAINING - Businesses that require significant on the job training can be difficult to start since competing businesses will have little incentive to help create pipelines 
- STARTUP CAPITAL - d 
- HIGH TRUST - d 

IDEAL STUDENTS FOR THE EDU CORP MODEL

- HIGH APTITUDE - d 
- HIGH ENERGY/MOTIVATION/GRIT - d 
- DISADVANTAGED - Of course the mission is to help the disadvantage start and own successful businesses.  But more than that, if one has high aptitude, high energy and grit, and were NOT disadvantaged, why would you opt to join Edu Corp where you will be required to cosign loans spend time helping others create their business?  You wouldn't, you would just create your business directly.  Edu Corp is specifically designed for those who have energy/ambition but are in danger of wasting that ability because they have no good paths forward.
- UNCONSTRAINED - The 


"Magic" Benefits Relative To Other Models

For The Student

MUCH LOWER RISK - Traditional trade school can be risky.  Book learning might not translate to real business.  There might not be a job for you.  Most profits might go to the company not you.

ZERO COST UP FRONT COSTS - d 

EXPERT MENTORS - Edu Corp upperclassmen are in your line of work, actively using the knowledge and business connections you desperately need. 

SKIN IN THE GAME - Traditional models throw you to the wolves and you must survive alone.  Edu Corp upperclassmen have co-signed your incorporation loans!  They will pay dearly if you fail, so they will work hard for you to succeed.
 

## EDU CORP FROM THE STUDENT'S PERSPECTIVE


AT HOME 
One day a group came to my village:
- A successful business owner  (with clothing, car, and phone to match)
- Five senior students and three freshmen
They said:
	"Soon we will own a business like she does.
	In two years, you can own your own business too.
	It will cost you nothing, except hard work.
	Come join us, we must find new students before we can graduate.
	We will train, house, and feed you for free.  You can go home anytime if you don't like it.
	Of course, only come if you are ready to work hard for your business, 
	since we will send you home if you are not serious about it."


Freshman Phase

WEEK ONE - So I went...  why not try it?
- Nine others joined in my month.
- The seniors in charge of new recruits were with us most of the last three days.  
- Now I live with a couple of juniors and am scheduled to help in a different place each day of the week.
- Classes are held both in the one classroom, and out on the machines every day.
- Everybody works pretty hard... and nobody is really watching them.

Halfway through my freshman year.
- The school keeps open books so I can see the money the seniors are making...
I already understand how many things work, I know I will be able to run my own farm soon, and the seniors just bought the land for their farm!  Now I know I want to stay!
- I am very close to most in my cohort, we don't know which corporation we will be part of, but we do know that our whole cohort will all be in the same corporation.
We are inseparable, mostly playing after school with each other.

A REALITY CHECK - The senior cohort decided to ask two classmates to leave the school.  They didn't have any in either class that were even considering cosigning their loans, they were often not punctual, and their work quality was not great.  Still, this is a reality check, I need to have four or five classmates agree they will sign my future progression loan before the end of my freshman phase.

Junior Phase

LIFE AS A JUNIOR
- These days I mostly just work hard.  I am still learning but mostly am just working and teaching others.
- After school and work, my remaining time is completely taken up by the soccer league I organize as part of my community contribution. 
- The cohort voted to eject a student... we are better off, he had co-signers lined up, but there was endless friction between him and MANY at school.  The central non-profit had us document our complains in detail, and that info was forwarded to other nearby schools.  I think one agreed to bring him in on a trial basis.  I have my doubts that will work out, but it is good he is getting a second chance.  Maybe getting booted out will be a wakeup call?
- We had to scramble to find a few more freshman and get them trained, although there will be time, since we have agreed no matter which cohort graduates to a new business first, these new students will be in the group that stays at the school.

- Our school has chosen a tough billet for our senior progression.  We have agreed to create a new school that is 300 km away and most of the incoming class will speak a different language!
- Still we are receiving a large discount on our progression loan for this choice!
- No other school would bid for this offer, since they don't have any students who spoke the language there.
- I do, and so does another at our school.  We are having a blast, travelling from village to village.  But I am tired of saying the same story!
- I am not sure if we are getting good students, we are trying hard, but it is much harder to gain trust here, since we did not grow up here.  We are really earning that discount!

THE JUNIOR COUNCIL
- Others in my cohort are on the Junior council, they are the ones in charge of our progression loans.   Even how much money the seniors will get when they sell their school to us, and how much of a discount will be given to those who move to the new school we are creating this year.
- I hope my cohort does not get chosen for the new school, the council decided it was worth a 15% reduction in the loans, but it is *so* far from the market... not worth it.
- The Junior council negotiates every detail of the split, but strangely they never know if they are arguing for or against themselves ... each of the three junior cohorts will go a different path... we just don't know which will be our path.


GRADUATION DAY!!
- No more promises.  Those who agreed to co-sign my senior loan, have just signed on the dotted line! 
- 4 out 5 were the same ones who agreed in my freshman phase.
The 5th one was part of a class whose business that has just completely failed.
 We all managed to find replacement co-signers, but it was a mess, most had to promise a small payback premium.  My soccer league paid off for me, since one of the Seniors just agreed to accept me as an additional co-signer based on his trust.
- We were randomly selected for that new school.   
Ugh.  But I don't care so much, we did save 15%, and soon I will graduate anyway!

Senior Phase
- So quickly our cohort is in charge!  We now own the school; its profits are our profits.
- Soon we will sell it to the Juniors and buy land for our farm.
- I hardly ever work on the farm
I am busy teaching the freshman (I remember my first days here), 
Buying and build all that is needed for our new farm, we decided to buy it near our village (which is far from here)  
- Some of us are living there now, busy building housing, still we will have to share in the beginning.
- This school is much harder than we thought, freshman respect us and work hard, but many upper classmen don't speak the same language.  
The rest of us do a lot of teaching!
- And I am very proud that to be the ones who were the first here.  I am sure this school will double many times quickly, there are so many potential students here!

MY SECOND PROGRESSION LOAN
- This is the progression where we are finally buying the land for my farm.
- I was already earning pretty good money while owning the school, but finally this is where I can settle in and build a life.

CORPORATE BUILD OUT
- Yesterday we signed a lease for our land and purchased most of the equipment we will be using.  
- To save money for the first few years we will lease much of our heavy equipment from the school.  We have agreed they have first priority on the equipment, so this will mean using it all night during harvesting, but it is really lowering the overall costs of starting the new business, eventually we will need to buy new equipment, it pushes those costs out a precious few years.
- We are also leasing space from the school for a small, fixed fee in order to grow our seedlings through the first two months, and then transport them to our land right as we take possession.  This shaves a couple of months off the time before we can start paying our loans back-every month represents dollars in our pocket and lowered risks on the loans.


HOW IS THIS WHOLE THING STARTED?

... Krzshiek I think this the question you asked, so I put this section right at the top ...

Before diving into the full complexity of the Edu Corp model, this section provides a thumbnail sketch of how the entire process might be bootstrapped from scratch.

THE RESEARCH PHASE
- Spreadsheeting - Identifying a good starting business will be quite challenging:  
- The ideal business should:
	- have a three-to-six-year payback period for its new business loan,
- 
	- be in a good geography with good governmental relations,
	- have good access to customers and suppliers,
	- along with many other specific requirements for each business type.
Finding good candidate business models will be quite challenging.  Ideally this "spreadsheeting" operation can be scaled-up so we are considering many potential alternate businesses to maximizes chances of immediate success on the first one.
- Business Model Construction - For each of the one or more businesses that are ultimately selected a business model is constructed detailing the required funding, the payback period, required critical  supplier/customer connections, etc.

PARTNERING PHASE
- Sector Partnerships - any business sector chosen will likely already have non-profits and for-profit businesses focused on growing such businesses.    In many cases we will be natural allies for these businesses; building those partnerships even before Edu Corp begins will be key to ensuring its success.  For example, suppose we selected greenhouse farming as Edu Corps initial business sector then:
	- Partnering with pre-existing non-profits focused on starting greenhouse farms would be natural.  They would have significant practical expertise and a very aligned goal of getting more greenhouse farms started.  From their perspective we would be bringing money and a new business model to support their mission.  And Edu Corp would be more than happy to share in any "credit" for businesses created.
	- Partnering with downstream business would be natural as well.  Markets and stores that well the produce would potentially be happy to have a new supplier for their business.  Especially one that promise to scale in size, reliability, and efficiency.
	- Partnering with upstream businesses would likely be the easiest of all.  After all we represent another customer.  The manufactures for greenhouses as well as the purveyor of all kinds of hardware that might will be needed.
- Specialty-Skill Partnerships - businesses require a myriad of technical services for their setup and execution.  The central non-profit must look for appropriate providers to work for these new businesses. Because these are newly formed businesses and they are being approached by a non-profit corporation, there may be opportunities for some pro-bono or reduced rate work for some period for these businesses.  Services will include:
	- Legal services
	- Financial/Accounting services
	- Governmental liaison services
	- And possibly other technical services (e. g. surveying, etc.)
	- Plus, relevant experts from the targeted business area.
- Intellectual Property  - The ideal businesses will have significant barriers to entry which Edu Corp is helping to overcome.  One common barrier is relevant know-how.  
	- Training Materials - In order to corporation creation scalable the non-profit must acquire relevant training materials that ideally can be taught using a combination of: reading, video presentations, peer to peer on the job training.  Ideally very little paid instructor/expert time is required.
	- Contractual Templates - Ideally the basic business model is being replicated for each corporation with a little variation as possible.  This should allow for great reuse in many of the formal corporate and governmental documents required.  When possible we should be gathering these at the same time we are gathering other materials.
- Potential Donors - The vision potential scope of Edu Corp is colossal in size.  If its aligned incentives, ensure that the Corp tree mostly grows in places with rapid reliable returns wall street will fall over itself to loan more and more money.  It would only be limited by lack of disadvantaged people will.  This future potential is not proven until Edu Corp exists and is growing - still many philanthropists imagine spending their limited funds on a huge vision capable of transforming humanity.  We believe Edu Corp will look very attractive to such philanthropists.   
- Founding School Class - The founding class will set the tone and social norms for many subsequent schools and will serve as the test case that enables larger follow-on funding of the Edu Corp model.  Thus, it is essential that great care is taken in identifying ideal students for the first class.  In some cases, partner organization within the same business space may know of ideal candidates for this role.  In any case, great care must be exercise in identifying these starting students.



EDU-CORP NONPROFIT FORMATION
Incorporation - The Edu-Corp nonprofit is formed 
Seed Funds Acquired - The seed funding required to stand up the first vocational school is acquired.
Founding School Created - unlike all subsequent schools the first school is directly owned by the Edu Corp nonprofit and purchased using its seed funding.  Assets required for the founding school are acquired using a combination of seed funding and collateralized loans.


THE FOUNDATIONAL SCHOOL
Foundational Class Timeline - Each cohort class at the foundational school operate differently than all subsequent classes.  They will never have to co-sign loans for their underclass, instead they take the "long road" to owning their own business (see second generation schools below).  
Founding Cohort Templates - The founding cohorts will serve as a kind of experimental testbed for Edu Corp.  Many social and legal aspects of corporate life must be ironed out.  How does the school do its recruiting outreach?  How are meals handled?  What are training and working hours?  Since each corporate school will ultimately be a stand-alone entity it is important that they begin with a robust set of policies to ensure good outcomes.  (e. g. what is the policy for failure for showing up to work, or repeatedly not completing training materials, etc.)  A complete set of starting policy templates will be ironed out with help and oversight from Edu Corp itself.


SECOND GENERATION SCHOOLS
Senior Cohort - The senior cohorts founding these second-generation schools are special.  They will never have to co-sign business loans for their underclass, but in trade they have a longer road before they own their own business.  Each founding cohort at a second generational will:
1.	First get trained themselves at the foundational school by the mentors and partners of the Edu Corp nonprofit profit, and possibly by earlier cohorts at the foundational school.
2.	They in turn train their lower classman at the foundational school before leaving it.
3.	Upon founding their own school, they must recruit and train under class cohorts.
4.	Finally, they sell their school to one of their junior cohorts and use the proceeds to purchase their final business when their other junior cohort.
Junior Cohorts - Each underclass at a second generational school operate according to the standard progression paradigm (described below), and they are the first generation to begin co-signing loans for the underclassmen trained at their school.
