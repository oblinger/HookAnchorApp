## SCHOOL MODEL

- Run by one stellar senior, 2 juniors, and 2 freshman.
	- Senior is the only one earning a real salary
	- Juniors are earning 'bee hives' the faster they can buy them the faster they can graduate.
	- Freshman are working for free for the first month then they are 'paid' in a nominal fraction of the new hives.

- Schools have enough land to have the hives for three generations of businesses on premises.  Owners relocate once their loans and their dependent loans are all covered.shut
