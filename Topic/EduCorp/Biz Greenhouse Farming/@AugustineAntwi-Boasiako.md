Augustine,

I am in the midst of selling my Business, and am considering kicking off a non-profit idea that has been on my back-burner for the last 5 years.  At its heart this is a novel mechanism for funding, oversight, and accountability on projects that require significant seed capital, but also deliver reliable downstream profits.  The idea is to empower individuals (not large corporations) to reap the benefits of these downstream profits.

I think greenhouse farming in Ghana might be an ideal application area for this funding mechanism, it seems to have an ideal set of properties for this approach, but I wont really know this until I have built a reasonably detailed model of how this business would operate.  I noticed your article in Right For Education, and your current status at CSIR and thought you might be interested to learn of this project, and at the same time to provide your insights into how one should best analyze greenhouse farming in Ghana.

If you have a time for a brief call, I would love to connect.

Best Regards,
Dan Oblinger, PhD.
