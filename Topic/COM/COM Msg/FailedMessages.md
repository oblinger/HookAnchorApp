Joe,

In a Quora post you argued connecting with the right recruiter is key.  

Your advice stood out because the firm I co-built, Analytics Fire, is in the final stages of acquisition, so I find myself quietly considering what might be next and would love to be a part of your network.

A few quick notes about me:

- I’m an AI/ML/Robotics PhD
- I’ve held leadership roles at start-ups, as well as at DARPA and IBM
- I have 3 exits under my belt
- I’ve commercialized across $2B in assets
- I’ve built three 50+ engineer orgs in SF

Look forward to possibly connecting, as I’m considering advisor or leadership role with companies focused on novel AI-tech.
