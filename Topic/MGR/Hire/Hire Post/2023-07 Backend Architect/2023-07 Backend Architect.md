(Principal Software Engineer/ Software Architect (full-time)

At Sports Visio we are tackling the cutting edge problem of using AI/Computer Vision to turn video recorded from a smartphone into real time basketball stats–which player made the shot, block or assist.  We are bringing NBA-level analysis to everyone along with auto-generated per-player highlight clips, social media content, etc.

We are a tight team of experts across all areas: PhD propellor heads in computer vision, across to long time ballers in the industry.  We are looking for a passionate Principal Software Engineer/ Software Architect with 8+ years of hands-on experience architecting and building world-class APIs and databases to join our crew.  Could that be you?


In this role, you will:
- Lead the architecture, design, and implementation of scalable, reliable, and maintainable software solutions.
Provide thought leadership and build software solutions that deliver high-impact business and customer value.
Collaborate with a diverse cross-functional team, including business partners, Product Managers, and designers, to define product requirements, direction, and clarity.
Drive technical innovation and improvements of the design and architecture of software systems towards leading-edge technologies and practices.
Define, develop, and drive software engineering best practices.
Become an expert in the business process domain to support the business better and align technologies with the business outcomes.
Work with the leadership team to develop and execute the company’s technical and business strategy.
Perform technical due diligence and architectural assessments of third-party technologies and solutions.
Experiment and test ideas, validate assumptions against needs, reach conclusions and recommend solutions.
Document standards, best practices, and engineering artifacts so others can easily understand, build, and maintain best-in-class software systems.
Debug the critical problems which arise in production and execute effective solutions within the application and across multiple applications/systems.
Lead continuous learning and process improvement activities to improve the design and overall engineering practices.
Grow talent by participating in hiring and mentoring team members.
Ability to identify missing or ambiguous requirements. Ability to design at high and low levels of abstraction, understand complex requirements, and translate them into understandable solutions. Ability to accurately estimate based on requirements.
Understand the rationale behind and how changes impact the enterprise, applications, and the technical/business ecosystem.
Requirements:
Must be able to speak English
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, or closely related field of study; or equivalent work experience.  Master’s degree is a plus.
8+ years of software engineering experience
Must be able to work with a high-performance distributed team in a startup or equivalent fast-moving corporate environment.
Experience in the lead role overseeing the technical direction of a team of software engineering talent across multiple software systems.
Expert knowledge of software engineering best practices with experience building complex software engineering products
Extensive experience with building and driving the adoption of software engineering best practices.
Strong understanding of distributed systems, cloud computing, and microservices architectures
Experience working on mission-critical enterprise-class applications
Demonstrated ability to work with business partners, cross-functional team members and coach and mentor experienced team members
Extensive experience in relational databases like RDS, MySQL, data modeling, and design
Experience with Nest.js (Typescript) and ORM
Experience with working with AWS
In-depth experience with building application programming interfaces (API).
Experience in API security, analytics, throttling, caching, logging, request, and response modifications

TechHunting:
At Sports Visio we are an AI-tech company applying recent advances in computer vision to the problem of automatically computing stats for basketball directly from video.  Our complete solution requires full stack talent in both web and mobile.  Our team is largely based in South America / Argentina and so we hope to continue hiring in this region.  We are having difficulty sourcing a few key roles and are reaching out to see if helping us land such talent is something you might be able to help with.

We have a team of about 15 devs and would like to use the hiring of our backend architect as a first case for us to explore together.  We have a detailed job ad that we can share, but it would be nice to have a quick summary regarding how you operate as a starting point.  Just a few sentences about pricing and business model / process is helpful.  We can also have a quick call to clarify our need if that turns out to be something we should pursue.  I am very happy to hear back from you, but I would request that you not add my email to any mailing lists.

Looking forward to hearing more!

Dan Oblinger, PhD
CTO Sports Visio

COMPLEX P2P - Kavak - 
- thousands of developers

- "AT this point in my career I dont have ego about technical decisions"
- "I have an ego about what creating things - and without wasting resources"
	- We are spoiled with so much money, want to be 
- "I really know technology"
- "At a certain point in your career the patterns "
- DESIGN - XN telecom project - CYO project
	- They were sure it would only be a couple of sprints, and had a bad attitude with many.
	- In end had good working relationship.  how?

		- Realized others were moving faster.  started believing him 


IMPROVEMENTS
- Kavak - standardize system to improve coding velocity - it went really wrong (last guy)
	- "Believe in SW pillars not tools"
	- Forced everyone to use same tools.  but not organzied the tool.
	- SOLN:  We need to train teams: layered & modularized.  moved things you could not change.
		- the strategy creating strong SW exported to other


DESIGNING - XN working with Telecom - wanted a fin tech app - just doing the backend.
- Needed to design the features with the product team.
- Worked closely with three product owner leads. 
- EXAMPLE: if you make a payment, will account balances immediately change
