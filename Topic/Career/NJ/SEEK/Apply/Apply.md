## 2025-11-01  Two Intuitive Jobs



I have 15 years of experience applying Machine Learning in robotics, Computer Vision, and medical contexts.  At Analytics Fire, I lead the development of real-time video connectivity for robotics surgery at Arthrex.  At Martian Robotics and then Aeolus, I led the development of two different dexterous robotic systems. Currently, I am leading a computer vision team in building deep models for sports analysis.

My passion and strength is fusing deep scientific, technical, and business constraints into a roadmap and day-to-day choices for advanced product development.  I thrive in the fast-moving productization of research ideas that are nearing the point of commercialization at scale.  Excellent teams require leadership that deeply understands constraints from all three sides and is creative in setting a driving, effective action.  I am presently hands-on coding and leading the execution of Deep-Learned Computer Vision models for sports analytics.  This work is rewarding, but I would like to return to work with greater benefit to humanity as a whole, and I think Intuitive Surgical would be an awesome place to do that.
