You are a recruiter, career counselor and certified coach with extensive experience working with and successfully placing data scientists and data analysts into well fitting positions. 

Please craft a cover letter < 400 words for the attached job description based on my experience (see attached resume) using the following structure:

(1) Start with a compelling hook that shows how my background is relevant to the current position.  Prioritize unorthodox, lesser known hook formulas and feel free to ask me any questions to identify the best hook.  

(2) Structure the rest of the cover letter by addressing the top 2 to 3 pain points described while making a case for the top 3 competencies the hiring manager is interested in using the attached resume. Feel free to ask me any questions to clarify details about my experience to support the case you may want to make. Don't force 3 pain points if my experience cannot make a strong case (or have anything interesting to say) for any particular pain point. 

(3) Please use bullets and bolding to show the pain points clearly so that recruiters and hiring managers skimming quickly can see the structure and content of the message clearly. Use this lead: My experience addresses several challenges outlined in your job description:

(4) Make sure to clearly indicate the job I am applying for and any identification number

(5) Where possible, incorporate details about the company, emphasising its mission or unique aspects that align with my values. 

Please use job-specific terminology from the job description as much as possible and keep the tone professional and  confident yet humble--focus on contributing rather than asserting. Avoid contractions and exaggerated language (eg. how my background aligns "perfectly" with a job description or how my experience is "precisely" what the company is looking for)--a more measured tone is more credible more closely matches my voice.

You are a recruiter and a certified career coach with extensive experience working with and successfully placing data scientists and data analysts into well fitting positions. I'm applying for the attached job using the attached resume. Please review the cover letter below on the degree to which it makes a compelling case for my candidacy. I don't like exaggerated language (such as how my background aligns "perfectly" with a job description or how my experience is "precisely" what the company is looking for)--in my opinion this decreases ones credibility. However, I don't need to volunteer my weaknesses, such as the mention of visualisation experience in Excel and R, which are not directly relevant to this position--what else could I say?   

Another prompt I've used before:

Please review the cover letter below for grammar, professionalism, appropriateness, logic, redundancy and smooth transitions. PLease also reduce this cover letter by at least 15 words.



### 2025-04-01  Ya-Shin's Prompts

So, I've been developing two libraries: one of cover letter paragraphs describing my experience in X area (areas that are commonly sought for in JDs) and the 2nd of LLM prompts that I use repeatedly. Typically, bc my resume bullets do not provide sufficient detail for LLMs to correctly guess how I reached listed achievements, it tends to guess wrong and that's a reason why their drafts tend to be bad for me. But just now I applied for a job that was different from the usual description (I generally don't want manager type jobs but I was tricked by a false easy apply to apply for this one). The CL produced via below was reasonable:

  

In Claude.ai 

Step 1: paste (1) and attach JD--paste the response you get into an updated version of the JD.

Step 2: paste (2) and attach resume and JD

  

1) What are the top 3 competencies this hiring manager is searching for and what can infer are their main pain points? 

2) You are a recruiter and career counselor and certified coach with extensive experience working with and successfully placing data scientists and data analysts into well fitting positions.

Please craft a cover letter < 500 words for the attached job description based on my experience (see attached resume) using the following structure:

(1) Start with a compelling hook that shows how my background is relevant to the current position.  Prioritize unorthodox, lesser known hook formulas and feel free to ask me any questions to identify the best hook.  

(2) Structure the rest of the cover letter by addressing the top 2 to 3 pain points described while making a case for the top 3 competencies the hiring manager is interested in using the attached resume. Feel free to ask me any questions to clarify details about my experience to support the case you may want to make.

(3) Where possible, incorporate details about the company, emphasising its mission or unique aspects that align with my values. 

Please keep the tone professional and confident yet humble, using job-specific terminology from the job description as much as possible.
