To build the world’s fastest AI inference technology, enabling efficient, cost-effective, and accessible adoption of AI and ML across industries ￼.
### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: C
#### dlproj1: 
.-.Groq LPU inference engine – Developed a new AI chip architecture (Tensor Streaming Processor) and the Groq Language Processing Unit, specialized for ultra-fast, batch-free inference on large models. In independent benchmarks, Groq’s system achieved state-of-the-art latency and throughput on GPT-size model inference, outperforming other cloud AI platforms  .
#### dlproj2: 
...Scaling inference with Saudi partnership – Secured a $1.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia to expand Groq’s generative AI inference infrastructure  . This will deploy Groq hardware at scale for real-time AI services, demonstrating confidence in Groq’s ability to accelerate nation-wide GPT and GenAI applications.
#### dlproj3: 
LLMOps platform (Groq Orq) – Introduced an end-to-end platform for Large Language Model Ops: Groq’s software (like Orq.ai) helps enterprises build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications on Groq hardware ￼. It streamlines fine-tuning and serving of LLMs (e.g. GPT-3, chatbots) with tools for versioning, testing, and cost management, leveraging Groq’s fast inference to support responsive GenAI services.
