### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)

AI Smart Trackers – Gong’s conversational intelligence platform uses generative AI to automatically track and analyze key topics in sales calls. These Smart Trackers summarize call content, detect buyer sentiment cues and risks, and map events to sales methodologies (e.g. highlighting when a competitor is mentioned or a pricing objection arises), giving managers deeper coaching insights without manually listening to calls ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
AI Scorecard Suggestions – An AI feature that generates a summary and performance score for each sales call. Gong’s system uses GPT-based models to assess how well a sales rep covered important topics, then produces a brief coaching report: for example, praising effective questions or flagging missed cues. It also links to relevant call moments for evidence ￼. This automates what a manager would do in a 1:1 review, saving time and providing consistent feedback at scale.
#### dlproj3: 
Call Spotlight – A generative AI capability (part of Gong’s proprietary LLM models for revenue teams) that instantly surfaces the highlights and next steps from a sales call ￼. Call Spotlight condenses a lengthy customer call into an outline of key points (such as customer pain, objections, and agreed follow-ups), allowing reps to quickly grasp context without re-listening. Trained on Gong’s huge dataset of sales interactions, it’s tailored to recognize sales-specific signals and produce highly relevant, accurate call summaries.
