Automation Co-Pilot (2023) – An AI assistant embedded in enterprise applications to help users with workflow automation via natural language. Co-Pilot is powered by generative AI, letting employees simply ask in plain English to fetch data or execute business processes. It orchestrates the appropriate bots and API calls under the hood, so complex tasks (from updating records to handling insurance claims) can be initiated through a conversational chat interface ￼ ￼
#### dlproj2: 
AI Agent Studio (2024) – A generative AI-based development studio for creating custom “AI agents” that can automate complex processes. AI Agent Studio provides low-code tools to design, deploy, and govern AI-driven bots that use LLMs and enterprise data (via retrieval-augmented generation) to make decisions and take actions. It enables developers of all skill levels to build specialized agents (with access to company knowledge bases) that execute tasks via natural language instructions, with built-in governance and transparency features ￼ ￼
#### dlproj3: 
IQ Bot (2018) – An intelligent document processing bot that applies deep learning to extract structured data from unstructured documents. IQ Bot uses computer vision and machine learning to “read” semi-structured documents like invoices, purchase orders, and emails – classifying fields and capturing values with minimal human training. It learns from each document example, improving accuracy over time, and integrates with RPA workflows to automate data entry and document-heavy processes ￼ ￼
