To revolutionize the long-haul trucking industry through the development and implementation of cutting-edge autonomous technology ￼.
### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
AI sensor fusion & mapping – Developed a modular autonomy system (“Kodiak Driver”) that uses deep learning for multi-sensor (camera, LiDAR, radar) fusion and a lightweight mapping approach, allowing autonomous trucks to handle ever-changing highways (e.g. construction zones) without HD maps ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Deep vision for trucking – Applied state-of-the-art deep neural networks to lane detection, object and traffic-sign recognition, and 3D perception on highways, enabling reliable long-haul truck autonomy ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Automated AI training pipeline – Built an “AI flywheel” data pipeline that integrates advanced pre-labeling of sensor data with human annotation tools, automating training data generation and continuously improving Kodiak’s driving models ￼.
