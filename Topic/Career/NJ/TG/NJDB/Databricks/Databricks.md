### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Dolly 2.0 (2023) – An open instruction-tuned LLM released by Databricks. Dolly 2.0 is a 12-billion-parameter model fine-tuned on a new 15K record human-generated dataset (databricks-dolly-15k) and openly released for commercial use, allowing organizations to create ChatGPT-like apps without relying on proprietary APIs ￼ ￼
#### dlproj2: 
MPT (2023) – Family of open-source “Mosaic Pretrained Transformer” models (7B and 30B parameters) introduced after Databricks’ acquisition of MosaicML. MPT-7B prioritizes efficiency and MPT-30B higher quality; both are commercially usable and can be further trained on custom data, enabling organizations to deploy their own advanced LLMs ￼ ￼
#### dlproj3: 
Mosaic Diffusion (2023) – A text-to-image generative model released by Databricks/MosaicML. Mosaic Diffusion is optimized for efficiency, turning text descriptions into images. The code and pre-trained weights were open-sourced, allowing enterprises to generate and customize images with a model trained on a trusted, proprietary dataset (e.g. a collaboration where it was trained on Shutterstock’s image library) ￼ ￼
#### dlproj4: 
LLM Foundry (2023) – An open-source library by Databricks for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating large language models. LLM Foundry provides highly optimized code and recipes (e.g. support for FlashAttention, low-precision techniques) to help researchers and industry train big models like GPT-style transformers efficiently at scale ￼
