### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Pelican (Anti-Hallucination) – SRI’s researchers developed Pelican, a framework that splits tasks into sub-queries to make generative AI more trustworthy, reducing hallucinated content by ~32% in image-based question answering experiments ￼ ￼
#### dlproj2: 
AiCorb Generative Design – a collaborative project with Obayashi Corp. and Hypar: AiCorb® is an AI “machine creativity” toolkit that lets architects input a rough 2D sketch or photo and automatically generate a feasible 3D building model (BIM) for rapid ideation and visualization of architectural designs ￼ ￼
#### dlproj3: 
Generative Memory (Lifelong RL) – SRI’s AI researchers (as part of DARPA’s L2M program) created a generative memory mechanism for reinforcement learning agents that “replay” imagined past experiences, allowing continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting (inspired by how sleep consolidates human memory) ￼ ￼
#### dlproj4: 
TrinityAI (Neuro-Symbolic) – under DARPA’s ANSR program, SRI leads TrinityAI, a hybrid AI system combining symbolic reasoning with deep learning (large language models) to create transparent, resilient agents that adapt safely to never-before-seen situations, improving human trust in AI recommendations ￼ ￼
