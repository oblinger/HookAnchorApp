### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlproj1: 
PlusVision transformer perception – Introduced PlusVision™, a perception stack built on transformer networks, occupancy grids, and BEV 3D reasoning for superior scene understanding in complex driving environments, easily adapting across sensor setups ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Auto-labeling 3D pipeline – Developed a multi-view camera auto-labeling algorithm that reconstructs 3D ground truth from camera data, producing training labels for 3D perception without manual annotation (boosting model accuracy with self-supervised data) ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
L4 autonomous driving with Generative AI – Plus’s driver-out autonomy solution leverages generative AI and large-scale models to enable fully driverless semi-trucks, as part of its next-gen Level 4 driving software ￼.
