### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Character Engine – Inworld’s core platform for creating generative NPCs whose personalities, memories, and behaviors are driven by AI. Developers can design virtual characters that carry on open-ended conversations and react dynamically, going beyond scripted dialog trees ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Xbox Partnership – a multi-year collaboration with Microsoft to build AI tools for game development, harnessing generative AI for dialogue and narrative. Inworld’s tech will help studios generate interactive character dialog and quests at scale, as announced with Xbox’s Gaming AI division ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
“Neo NPC” Project – a partnership with Ubisoft and NVIDIA showcasing AI-powered game characters (“Neo NPCs”) that can speak directly with players. This demo (revealed in 2024) used Inworld’s conversational AI and Nvidia’s Audio2Face to enable realistic, unscripted NPC interactions in future games ￼.
