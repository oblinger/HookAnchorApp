### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Stable Diffusion on IPU – Demonstrated high-performance image generation by running Stable Diffusion diffusion models on Graphcore IPU processors ￼. Through integrations like Hugging Face Optimum, developers can perform text-to-image generation on IPU-PODs with efficient parallelism, showcasing IPU as a viable platform for generative vision AI.
#### dlproj2: 
Cloud IPU services for GenAI – Partnered with cloud providers (e.g. Paperspace, Gcore) to offer on-demand IPU hardware for generative AI workloads ￼ ￼. This allows AI startups to fine-tune large language models or other GenAI models on Graphcore’s IPU infrastructure, benefiting from the IPU’s speed and parallelism without owning hardware.
#### dlproj3: 
IPU for extreme-scale models – Developed the second-generation Bow IPU systems with greater memory and scalability, enabling training of extremely large models with efficient scaling ￼. Graphcore’s unique architecture unlocks new efficient training regimes (e.g. fine-grained parallelism) for models that are challenging for GPU clusters, targeting advanced generative AI and ML applications.
