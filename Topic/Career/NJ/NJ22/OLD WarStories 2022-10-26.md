- Joe at Acme will provide X by DATE1  (with contract having DATE2>DATE1 in planning)
- Aggressive steak holder notification of delivery risks.
#### . In House Testing Upon Delivery (AF)
- Ultimately do it for free; but try to charge on next cycle.
#### . Poor Counter-Party Performance Planning (AF)

## = EXAMPLES: HUMAN PUZZLE PIECES

	Early failure feedback
- Notice where people gravitate; build from that

### - AMBITIOUS
#### . Attilla
#### . Krzsiek

### - STRONG DIFFICULT
#### . Alexy
- Let him operate on his own
- Let him define & own and run his own stuff
	- He defines, we review, raise inconsistencies
	- He delivers, tests and supports integration
- Required to provide short term coaching on specific activities

- Issues:
	- didn't respect others (but he was stronger dev)
		but was polite as long as other was more junior & not too much of his time
	- Poly-phasic sleeper
	- didn't want others defining his tasks/apis, but his work was good
		--> just needed to validate his approach was compatible (& would easily update)
#### . in the Italian log cabin

### - GAP FILLING
#### . Matt 
Stressed by top down politics
Stressed by ambiguity

## = EXAMPLES: DELEGATION
What’s your approach to delegating work to employees? 
### --- Ensuring Results:  SMART
How do you ensure that tasks are completed?

--> Let THEM tell YOU when and how they will do it.  AF-admin-team.  AF-leads.  AF-alexey. 
> Get precise especially about when.  Add time for other things.
> Allow them to slip for good reason, but be explicit and target new time

- SPECIFIC (simple, sensible, significant).
- MEASURABLE (meaningful, motivating).
- AGREED  Achievable (agreed, attainable).
- REALISTIC   Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
- TIME bounded (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).


### --- R&R Doc + One belly button ---
- AEOLUS Role & Responsibilities docs at.  (needed to tread softly, tentatively,  and swiftly, would often ask person to assume role for a month to 'help out')
- AF: Responsibilities Chart -- Hundreds of responsibilities
### --- By Written Input & Output ---
- Written output
- Video outputs -- At Aeolus.

_
### --- By Pairing ---
- AF: Hiring/Research - James with Maria
- AF: Piotr and Monica
- AEOLUS: Georgios (afraid of responsibilty), and Filepe
_
### --- Theory: Situational Leadership:   Directing --> Coaching --> Supporting --> Delegating
[Web](http://www.md2md.uk/delegation-using-situational-leadership/) [Situational Leadership](Kenneth Blanchard and Paul Hersey’s situational leadership model ) Blanchard&Hersey

					EMPLOYEE SKILL
				High		Low
SUPPORT High	Supporting	Coaching
SUPPORT Low		Delegating	Directing

- Precise output
- Small / Quick -- 
- From Them (in quick iterations)
- Written -- goal&output (even few sentences)
- SLOPPY! -- I grade on sloppiness of result
- VIDEO --
- Actually Delivered
- Process

DIRECTING: 
COACHING:  DARPA slides.  Aeolus: Theo.  AF Hiring
SUPPORT:  Aeolus: Georgios
DELEGATING: Aeolus Lane leaders:  Filepe&Severin, 

_
### --- Clarity beats Speed
- Dot your i-s and cross your t-s when delegating.  Extra overhead seems a waste at the time, but it's NOT!  Something blows up so often when you don't do it!

- Not able to make a quick 'firing' decision because tasking was not clear.  So failure was plausibly our fault.
- Ownership of testing and validation was not agreed upon @ Aeolus and it resulting in team skill gap.
- PH team data gathering.  Many hours of wasted effort, until we forced "single row" acknowledgment.  (cannot just say 'I got it'.  Instead say 'like this, right?')
  Highlighted mis-understandings, missing knowledge/capabilities etc.
### --- Simplicity is key in goal/business case
- Everyone needs to be able to articulate their goal easily and quickly
- 
### --- Communicate Obsessively
- Have regular 1-on-1 meetings w/ reports and stakeholders

### --- Create a Flywheel
- Creatively clump things together in order for you and others to gain efficiency in throughput.
- How things are delegated.  What things you&others are responsible for.  
- Which areas each person must 'keep track of'


### --- OKRs 
- Objectives and Key Results - Very powerful in cases where they can be made to make sense
- Many Contracting Objectives - Around completeness and timeliness for contracts and agile stories
### --- EXAMPLES ---

### --- AEOLUS:  Two level org structure
- Built around skill areas & architectural design
### --- DARPA: Decks.  DIRECTING -> COACHING ---

### --- AF: PDD.  Supporting --> Delegating ---

### --- AF: Hiring.  Directing --> Delegating ---

YES:  Under legal obligation.
- NDA occasionally requires white lies in order to keep secrecy.  (90% of the time an lie of omission will suffice)

- ABSOLUTELY YES - You do what you need to do to get the job done.  I would even enjoy a certain amount of it.
- BURSTY - Indeed I am a 'bursty' performer, with desire and ability to drive hard when it matters

#### . Monitoring and Testing Standards (DARPA)
- Worked with NIST/LDC on TREC competition and on test set creation & APIs
- Worked closely with XXX at Cycorp to develop BL curricula


## = DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT
### - TESTING
#### . Universal Video Validation  (Aeolus, Mgt, Fail, Testing)
   REQ:  Explain in text how you tested it & why that shows it is done.  Include phone video w/ audio.
==> Super super EASY.  No one can argue it is too hard.  avoids generality/stability need for repeatable tests.
==> Ensure testing really did happen.  (just compiled it!  couldn't test easily so said it 'worked')
==> Upper management results porn; Team alignment (hey! that is not done, or not right!)

  people were not lying exactly, but they were being sloppy and generous in saying it was tested.
  backlog items had a star if they needed a video (often sub items did not need a video)
  
#### . Robot Integration - Not done till upstream system ran (Aeolus, Mgt, Fail, Testing)
#### . Customer Bug-Frustration
- Customers don't like paying to fix newly discovered bugs in already delivered code.
- Built out cost effective testing org, and use it even when customer isn't paying for it.

### HACKED - Hacked something to my advantage

	- Convinced my linear algebra teacher that I should not be scored on my homeworks but only on my
	  test results.

	- Later used his open-ended test taking policy to save my GPA, by staying over an entire night and re-deriving 
	  two required lemmas that I would have known had I actually done the homework.

	  (ok, so my second hack was really more of a painful recovery from the consequences of my first hack.
	   still in the end, I got my way, and saved my grade.  Wise?  no.  but hacked, yes.)

#### Management
#### . Swim Lane Architecture
#### . Remote Robotics

### Management
#### . Remote Work
- 3-shifts.  24/7 lab tech support.  Fly-in
#### . Siloed & Interoperable work streams
### FAILURES
#### . "Completed" work failures
- Frequently we were running into failures in work that was claimed to be completed & tested.
- Obvious approach is to agree on formal tests, but way to costly for our velocity and work piece size.
  (is appropriate for 2 month integration tests, and maybe 3 week sprint tests, but not back log items)
- PUBLISHED 10 LEVELS of test & validation.  Documentation of validation included: the level used, an explanation, and a video.

--- Aeolus: 'done' things were never really ---
- Team members said it was done; Even fantisized it was
	but they had only tested their part
	but only run in simulation
	but only ran it in their context
	but it only ran once and is not stable

==> Needed to carefully construct test, that would really show it.	
==> Cell phone video
