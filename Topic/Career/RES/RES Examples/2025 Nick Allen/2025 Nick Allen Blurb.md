**Blurb: this is an example "blurb" I sent, along with my CV**

  

I'm a VP of Eng turned founder/CEO, re-entering the workforce after selling my bootstrapped company (which provided specialized engineering services to solar manufacturers). My aim is to go deeper in applied AI. I'm very interested in Forward Deployed Engineering, Forward Deployed Engineering Management, or a hybrid role spanning technical, sales, & service delivery.

  
My value prop is different from a traditional engineering leader:  

- **"Builder who can sell"** - From coding to sales, I do what needs to be done.
- **"Founder-mode" ownership** - I've bootstrapped a business from zero to multi-million in revenue, culminating in a successful M&A exit.
- **"Buck stops here" operational leader (not process facilitator)** - I've managed 15+ parallel software workstreams, while simultaneously also leading GTM, finance, recruiting, HR, and operations functions for the company. I did this by owning both process and outcomes.
