Rafah, awesome to catch up!  I am glad to hear your future plans include moving to more relaxing locations (both NH and FL fit that bill!)
Looking forward to hearing a more in depth summary from your side on our next call.
Here is a few sentences you can use to introduce me to your college who is setting up a new robotics group.

Dan is an ex-colleague of mine from IBM research.  He is in the midst of selling his third exited startup, and is deciding what he's going to do next.  Here are a few words from him:

The first chunk of my career was devoted to Machine Learning as an individual researcher (PhD from UIUC, IBM Researcher, teaching at Columbia) then scaling that to many hundreds of researchers as a Program Manager at DARPA.  The second chunk has been in silicon valley focused on Robotics, Machine Learning, and HW+SW systems.  I have co-founded a couple of successfully-exited Robotic, or HW+SW/IoT companies, and twice hired & managed 50+ person orgs, including 40+ PhDs in Robotics.

My sweet-spot and personal-love is managing teams that are bridging recent academic research into novel commercial plays.  I love the complex interplay between recently understood technologies and novel, not-fully-understood business use cases and products.  If there are roles within Microsoft that fit this kind of a sweet spot, I would love to hear about them!

### 2022-10-31  Avidan - Tessa VC
Avidan,

Over the years Tessa has told me a lot about you, so it will be great to finally make your acquittance. 

I am in the final stages of selling my startup into a fast growing building disinfection startup, and have just received an offer to be a late-joining co-founder & CTO for an unrelated computer vision startup.  It is an interesting offer and interesting technology, but I would be accepting w/o having really explored the larger market much.

So, as Tessa suggested in the note below, it would be great to get your perspective on this specific offer, and more generally on how I might best use my talents in the next years.  Beyond this, I think there is good value in us getting connected since you enjoy digging in on the early side of hard tech startups…. And I enjoy digging in on the early side of hard tech startups too!

Let me know if you have time for a short call or quick coffee in the next days.  I will arrange my schedule and/or location to accommodate.

Looking forward,
Dan
