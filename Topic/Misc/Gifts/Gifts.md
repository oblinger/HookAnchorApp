### misc
by the way….

these were great ideas!!  I have not done them yet, but I will

So, I searched the internet based on the info you gave me and if you're looking to do something with her, here is what I can suggest:

I saw this hiking tour at http://www.treebonesresort.com/eco-adventures/. It's a 4-hour drive from your home.

The best thing about it is after your hike, you can go Glamping in their Autonomous Tent for a really nice evening with a view of the ocean.

For food, they have a restaurant and a sushi bar.

As for a gift, since she likes to hike, and be outdoors, a great hiking watch would be great. Here is a link to Garmin Fenix 5

Now, if you want to go a bit stylish, I suggest getting her a Pandora Jewelry. They have a wide variety of charms that you can attach to a bracelet, earing or necklace that will customize the jewelry for your fiancee.

Let me know how you want to go and I will assist you.

Good luck!

it is my fiencee’s 40th b-day.  in a week.
I don’t need to get her anything big, but I am looking for some good ideas.  (I suck at gifts)

I have done jewelry in the past.  always good, but looking for other ideas.

some facts:
-- Expensive photography stuff
-- Loves hiking/camping/outdoors
-- Loves food / dining / doing things  ( maybe tickets to musical, simphony, etc.)
-- Anything we could do together
