## 2025-11-30  Mayo Clinic Notes

  The Big 3: Protein, Resistance Training, Consistency

  1. Protein is Critical
  - Target: 1.2-1.6g protein per kg body weight daily (some say up to 2.0g/kg)
  - ~25-30g protein per meal
  - Why: GLP-1 drugs reduce appetite, so you may accidentally under-eat protein → muscle loss
  - Sources: chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, tofu, legumes, protein shakes (low sugar)

  2. Exercise - Both Types Matter
  - Strength training: 2x/week minimum - crucial to prevent muscle loss and loose skin
  - Cardio: 150 min/week moderate intensity (brisk walking, cycling)
  - Muscle loss happens with ANY weight loss method; resistance training is your defense

  3. Diet Structure
  - Aim for 1,200-2,000 cal/day (300-500 deficit from normal)
  - Eat slowly, smaller portions, more frequently
  - Prioritize: lean protein, vegetables, fruits, whole grains
  - Avoid: high-fat foods, alcohol, refined carbs, sugary drinks
  - High fat + Wegovy = GI distress (nausea, diarrhea)

  Other Factors

  - Hydration: 64+ oz water daily
  - Sleep: Poor sleep disrupts appetite regulation
  - Stress management: Affects weight loss outcomes
  - Alcohol: Empty calories + amplifies side effects + blood sugar drops
