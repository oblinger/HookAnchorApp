  Semaglutide (same active ingredient as Wegovy):

  - Ozempic - approved for type 2 diabetes (also semaglutide, but lower doses than Wegovy)
  - Rybelsus - oral version of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes

  Other GLP-1 Receptor Agonists:

  Liraglutide:
  - Saxenda - for weight management (3.0 mg daily injection)
  - Victoza - for type 2 diabetes (lower dose)
  Tirzepatide (GLP-1 + GIP dual agonist):
  - Zepbound - for weight management
  - Mounjaro - for type 2 diabetes
  - Note: Often considered more effective than semaglutide
  Dulaglutide:
  - Trulicity - once-weekly injection for type 2 diabetes
  Exenatide:
  - Byetta - twice-daily injection
  - Bydureon - once-weekly injection
  Others:
  - Adlyxin (lixisenatide) - daily injection
  - Tanzeum (albiglutide) - discontinued in some markets

  Key Differences:
  - Semaglutide (Wegovy/Ozempic): Currently most popular, once-weekly
  - Tirzepatide (Zepbound/Mounjaro): Dual-action, potentially stronger weight loss
  - Liraglutide (Saxenda): Daily injection, older medication
  - Dulaglutide (Trulicity): Once-weekly, primarily for diabetes

  Most of these are prescription-only. Tirzepatide (Zepbound/Mounjaro) is gaining popularity as it may offer better results than semaglutide for weight loss.

TEMAZEPAM - A couple years ago you prescribed Temazepam for occasional insomnia. The stuff is great, it knocks me out, and does not last into the morning. As directed I use it very occasionally. Indeed it has taken years to use up the bottle! I would love to get a refill.

PRILOSEC - The lung doctor asked me to take Prilosec as an experiment to see if my persistent cough was related to acid reflux. You commented on my visit that if it was working for me, that we needed to move me to another medicine since ones body adapts to Prilosec. Indeed I have likely waited too long to switch... now I really get noticeable acid reflux if I stop taking Prilosec for a couple of days. What should I switch to?

LIVER RESULTS - My liver numbers (Bilirubin, AST, ALT) are often a bit too high. I am working on this thru diet (fiber, fruits, etc.) But so far, I have not really dropped them much. Still working on it! I just noticed a test result from 10/7/2019 (CPMC-E) that was an indicator for possible HEP-C.

Did I ever get checked for HEP-C? Should I? It seems a long shot, but I wondered if there could be a connection.

Bilirubin - colestatis - marker of obstruction - inflamed liver can do that -

### 2020-04-14  Stress test results


Interpretation Summary
 #1 technique suboptimal images
 #2 hypertensive blood pressure response to exercise
 #3 the patient developed a supraventricular tachycardia which appears to be AV   node reentry during exercise
 #4 abnormal exercise EKG with EKG evidence of ischemia at maximal exercise
 #4 normal resting left ventricular size and systolic function, left ventricular hypertrophy
 #5 no exercise echo evidence of ischemia at a maximal exercise level

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
__

Examination Performed: A two-dimensional stress echocardiogram was performed. A limited
color and spectral doppler study was performed. Study quality: Adequate.


Exercise Data: The resting blood pressure was normal (140/86 mmHg). The maximum age-
predicted heart rate (MPHR) was 166 bpm. The patient exercised for 7:15 of a 2 min Modified
Bruce protocol. The peak heart rate was 230 bpm. Percent MPHR: 138%. METs Acheived: 12.10. The
blood pressure response to exercise was abnormal (exaggerated 210/86 mmHg).

Resting EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 75 beats per minute.
Resting Echocardiogram: Normal global systolic function. Estimated EF is 55%. Resting
echocardiographic images demonstrated normal LV diastolic volume. LV wall thickness was
increased. There are no wall motion abnormalities. The color flow Doppler study showed trace
TR. The peak resting TR gradient was 23.0 mmHg.

Post Exercise EKG: SVT in 4th stage of exercise. Test stopped due high SVT heart rate 230
BPM which lasted into recovery. Horizontal to downsloping ST depression in recovery.
Post Exercise Echocardiogram: After exercise as described, there was a symmetric increase in
contraction, with an increased LVEF and decreased LVESV. There is a symmetric decrease in end-
systolic LV volume. No new segmental wall motion abnormalities were noted. The LV wall motion
score index was normal. The post exercise TR gradient could not be accurately measured.
Supervisor: Cardiac Nurse: Alex Valerio, RN. EKG Technologist: Jason Wong-Lima.
