UF 4 chunks
### 2019-08-14 - Dream
- Went with group of 4 companions to an amusement park, or resturants and pools, etc. on a pier.  
- There were lots of interactions with the possibility of sex, but I (we?) turned them down.
- The attendants as this park were kind of evil automoton-like people.  This place was wrong.
- we eventually pulled some part of it down, I was against this, but its effect eventually was to cause the whole place to collapse.

- This repeated, but this time Erlick, almost immediately tore something, to cause collapse.

- The third time maybe we acquiest to this place.

- Then someone (a woman, not in our group) realized the whole thing (marriage) was wrong, and so she screamed and it lifted some stuff off the top of a field of snow.  Over and over she shouted to remove section after section in a grid, until it was all gone.  Clearly she was relieved.

- This encouraged me to consider the same.  But as I did, it did not seem her solution was right for me.
### 2019-08-05 - AUGUST - Sleep - TopFocus

- SLEEP -- I am loosing 2 hrs per day in 1/2 sleep.  My plan:
	- THINK -- For 20min only think of dreams, 
		zero thinking about ideas or tasks.
	- WAKE -- At 20min get up and work for 2-4 hours.
- TOP ONLY -- Focus only on top tasks.
	- SLAM -- Slam non top tasks aside (drop, delay, quick do)
	- ATTEND -- Put focused slots on top tasks.
	- GOAL -- Define and achieve specific goals for top tasks
### 2019-08-05 - WEEK

Chunks  6 of 11.  plus 3
### 2019-07-01 - JULY - Work chunks first

I am not making the progress I could/should be making.
Couple of ideas:
- Need to have 2-3 focused chunks of 2-3 hours each.  (DOTS outside on lower right)
- Need to have morning free from meetings and working (CIRCLE outside on lower right)
	- Circle surround dot(s) that occurred in the morning (upto 1pm)
	- Circle if at least 2 hours free in morning.  Trying for 8a-1p

- Need to prioritize the work chunks.  Need to reset and start one if off track.
- Even doing lists of activties can count as a work chunk.  But only 3 per week can count.

JULY GOALS
-- House / Baby read (no pressing tasks)
-- AF Projects humming
-- ?? UF interp EXE+  (maybe printing new colon)
-- Most weeks 2x5 ; Sales thinking push fwd



MARCH GOALS
-- Uniform Novelty (Markdown, Agenda, Embed, Collab) . have 1meet & slides 
-- Uniform Finish markdown parser
-- ?? Uniform Useful Py impl
-- Todo Lists -- Get time sensitive Doc/House/Fin moving.  make progress
-- AF Sales ???
-- 1-2 meetings per week
-- ETC -- read 3 books.  do expllicit thinking
### 2019-07-01 - WEEK Back in town - slow week

I didn't get so much done this week.  At the end I had some luck with UF.
Something has to change.  See July Monthly Experiments.
### 2019-06-25 - WEEK Baby Shower Weekend

Last week was quick becuase it was sandwiched by two trips.  

- Catchup on all work proposals (enphase/legrange)
- Chunk of UF work on interpreter
- 1 day of home stuff

At end of this week I should feel in groove on home/baby/work proposals and have 1-day of UF interp done.
### 2019-06-18 - WEEK CEMEX weekend

Did not complete my prime tasks for the week.
CEMEX took up notable time.  As did daily tasks.

Upcoming week is shorted by a day.
Should be in good position to execute THREE core tasks this week W/R/F mornings.

Aim to keep meeting off of mornings.
### 2019-06-09 - WEEK Lists caughtup, Living room put together

I feel good this week that both by todo lists, and living room are in much better shape.
I have the idea that I can really "complete these" -- get them to the 80% done state, and focus on other areas of my life.

I worry that there is no commercializable path for uniform.
Also these days I put 5hrs per week into Uniform.  it is tiny.  most time is AF and home.

I need to time box both AF and home, then decide what is to be done with remainder of time.

I am pretty relaxed and happy these days.  Baby is comming too.
### 2019-06-05 - JUNE - Trying 2 chunks of focus on many days
FORMAT:
left 	- day of week
top 	- travel / meetings

TRACKING:

### 2016-05-25 – Lex Ownership

My goals:
l-- GROW – Able to safely work at Martian, Google, etc.  and retain ownership of newly grown Lex stuff
L-- INIT – Able to initiate new things and have them owned by me.
X-- CREDIT – Get broad credit for work done.

C-- MAJOR – Be the major owner of commercial entity using it.
	Ob Labs LLC   (Owns Uniform)
		ML-LLC  Dan Nick Sean
	

I don’t know how I might use Uniform in the future, but I won’t use my ownership of it to thwart aims that NDA puts significant and (hopefully ongoing) effort against.

Informal:
 If NDA starts doing a thing w. Uniform, then I never stop it, or try to own it.
 if NDA does not stick with a thing, or never really puts significant effort against a goal, then that goal is fair game for me to later own

### 2010-12-17 – LESSONS FROM DATING ELAINE

lesson

- I could not face the conclusions I was coming to.  So I did not.  but I also did not act.

- My expectations (rules) about how this should be froze me away from breaking up, and away from marrying.  neither met criteria, but by sheer force of will I imagined I could change one or the other.  Or at least fantasized that I could (Even thought at another level I expected I could not).


2010-11-18 – A day laid waste

I am trying to figure out things with Elaine, and manage to completely kill a day, in prep for thinking about that.
I want to understand this day.

### 2010-10-00 – Gave up on Siege

It occurred to me after our phone call yesterday, that ours was one of the best business relationships that I never had.  I was worried early on, based on the comments coming from STO, but I have found them to be quite groundless.  There have been several times when it was clearly in your best interest to simply let things ride along w/o comment—after all you were getting effort for free.  But you (or at least your wife) took it upon yourself to be explicit about assumptions being made.

In the end, it turns out that integrity is one of the most prized attributes in close partnerships.  Many folks believe they are operating with integrity, but integrity is not defined by your actions when there would be consequences, it is defined by those rare moments when there would NOT be consequences.  I think you have the right stuff to lead a successful organization—and for the kind of business you are shooting for—it is so critical that folks *want* to work with you, to trust in you.

I think early on you were really ready to open up to significant sharing.  You pushed for something safe for both of us.  Later you conveyed our lowering sense of opportunity in a good, open way.  Several times being explicit about it—all good stuff.  From my point of view this time was well worth it.   I really did put quite a bit of mental energy in this direction, but it pushed me to think about my time post DARPA, and gave me an inside look at starting my own gig.

In 20-20 hindsight, I would have played the game of the last year a little differently.  Playing around with SBIRs was probably not the right game.  Given that you were already in motionthe night we first spoke, and I was mentally quite far from leaving DARPA, I needed a “shoot the moon” as a strategy for catching up.

I needed to pitch work (white papers) that were generally separate from your current thrusts.  It is hard for that to work, since you would still be the one shopping those papers around.  Still it was really what was needed.  Winning work off of such a paper would be the basis for a quarter of Siege.  Winning a SBIR even two, would not qualify.  Especially if you have Joe doing the same w. little equity!  It just doesn’t add up.

I am not quite sure what to make of the fact that I did not even manage to achieve this lower goal.  In a certain sense it was a partial test, there was never enough riding on a SBIR to merit putting in sustained effort.  Still, it makes me question if I am too far from cyber to play that game.  I don’t think that is true.  My belief about AI+cyber is essentially unchanged.  Still it does give me pause…

At this point I think I am too late to get enough of Siege for it to make sense.  I do plan to continue down this path of pitching a Cyber program (at least if management gives positive signals).  If I do move in that direction post DARPA there may be some way to share equity across two inter-related companies which affords the right up sides for both of us.  I don’t know, but I am open to it.

In the end, I am convinced that you are the kind of person I would trust to work with—I would want to work with.  I am also convinced that the world is more win-win than anything else.  Whenever possible it is better to pool resources rather than going it alone.  So who knows, I don’t see the way forward right now, but I would be looking for that way forward.

Best luck with Siege!

### 2010-10-09 – Organizing Self

FOCUS – I can do many different things, but I jump from idea to idea way too quickly.  
- At DARPA there are so many efforts that have never gone anywhere, but I never ran into a wall, I just got working on something else.
- With Jason/Siege I never put the work in necessary to join siege, but still put much work in.
- In my research I have jumped from place to place

MAJOR TASKS
- NewStart
- Mgt MR/BL
- Admin
- NextJob
- Decision
- Fun


MY RESEARCH FOCUS – Teachable systems
This is consistent w. my work from: IBM, from BL, and Cyber or ISR.

–  work @ IBM 
### 2010-04-01 – Life is moving faster

There is much less time, than I am pretending there is.  But less that needs doing as well.
- Need to ensure that the important stuff is getting done.
- Need to ensure that each day is lived the way I want it to be lived.
- Need to be strategic in leveraging my activities.  Too often I build the first half but don’t reap the benefits.

- Need to be strategic in spending time.  I kill too many hours in less than effective ways:
   Meetings/calls that take too long.  Getting to into the details.  Procrastinating.  Piddling on small stuff.
   Working on tasks that are not the most impt.

- Days must have space & periods of fast activity.

- Should have few activities in each bucket, then keep coming back, so each activity is pushed to a place of value.



BUCKETS OF ENERGY
Project – personal “fun” projects – these can also have other value but must be fun.
Career – Pushing my career forward – beyond my day job
Work – My day job
Spiritual – Spiritual growth
Family&Friends – Paying attention to those that matter
Mate&MyFamily – D 
Self – Health, Finance, Possessions, Capabilities

PROJ:  TightKeys, ConfigTool, ?jason?
CAREER:  Jason, Pubs, StartupContacts, 
WORK:  Fewer more focused hours.  
FAMILY&FRIENDS:  Just a bit of time from time to time
MATE:  Make a decision
SELF:  Pretty on track.  Focused hours

### 2010-01-02 – From last year’s retreat  (12/2008)
