## 2025-11-24  Envelope.  Narrow focus
- Started using Envelope to keep on task
- Narrowed focus:
	- 40% applying
	- 40% learning

Let's see how this week goes!



## 2025-11-14  My Priorities

Here are my preferences:
BigCo AI Leader > Eng Mgr > StartupCTO > Consultant

- No idea if an AI-leader role is plausible
- I could hate the stress of the AI-leader role but the pay is double, and I'm probably good at it.
- Consultant is probably the best path to Eng Mgr
- If SV gets its A-round in June I am pretty safe for 2+ years, but salary 

## 2025-11-09  THE NICK TALK

- Talking with nick as he got his new job feels like a pivotal moment for me.  
- For the last 10 years, I have been flailing.  Dallying and dreaming but not 
	- Not with enough commitment in any direction to go anywhere, and 
	- without enough realism in my choices to actually achieve anything

In talking there are three targets right now
- CIAO or AI leadership job (MOST LIKELY / HIGHEST PROBABILITY PATH)
- AI Eng related job -- still mgt, but focused as a 'doer'  (LARGE DEMAND, BUT NO)

## 2025-11-03  Narrowing ...

- Each 1/2 of focused work is precious, I need to get a good handful of these each day, then use well.
- Narrowing focus to
	-  CIAO prep; ML Prep; Applying; AI-safety
	- Tiny work on HookAnchor and SV

## 2025-10-28  


## 2025-10-20  More Focus
I am letting myself work today on hook anchor, I am close to a resting spot.  after this, I will only allow fixes that are getting in the way of work, or that take < 15 min.  Lets see how that works.

- Need to wrap brain around ideas for AI-safety.
- Have a concrete idea if I am "going for it"
- Have concrete plans for rest of job search
- Make concrete progress this week on this


## 2025-10-13  Focus & Deliverables
- Letting myself off the hook w/ a diffuse set of targets, 
- and a lazy feeling that I won't achieve them anyway
- and by allowing other important things (Eli, Daily activities, SportsVisio to get in the way)

The key is to focus on a few items, and pick achivable advancement on each.
Here is my thinking:

AIsafety: Sketch of middle-path AGI-path, Read/Think/Sketch -- systems approach to AI safety.
Seek: Apply 3; follow recipe twice
Lrn: Train make/miss model

~~
The result is that I did significant work on a couple of items, but am still spending too much time on HookAnchor.

- [x] [[MPR]]: Sketch of middle-path AGI-path
- [x] [[AIS]]: R/T/Sketch systems approach
- [ ] [[Seek]]: Apply 3; follow recipe twice
- [x] [[Self]]: Ozempic, Basement, 
- [ ] Cloud Roadmap
- [x] Reach out: Dean, QL, 

- [ ] [[Make]]: Train make/miss model


## 2025-10-07  Made big progress when focused on Make/Miss; need to focus on AI Safety

- Need to make a quick initial assessment of AI safety viability in delivering a quick result as basis for talking w/ Antropic



## 2025-09-23  Biggest fail is starting each day on Hook Anchor

- I will try allowing myself to fix quick bugs on the fly, but not allowing myself to work on core task during the day.
- But really I STILL want to get this pup out!  It is a driving goal.
## 2025-09-23  Deeper problem job tasks are not task #1

This is the real problem, I have let getting hook anchor out be task #1, and really I am dubious and frightened about.


## 2025-09-23  Hook Anchor release absorbed all

I really nose dived on this goal of releasing hook anchor.

I have the belief that if I get this out, then my brain will be clearer to work on another major task, 

==> I do have the sense that I can get spread thin, by having multiple projects at once.

==> And I think I am happiest when making fast progress on a project, so this suggests being focused on one

"Fun-ish" project at a time, but this is giving me licence to nose dive and get nothing else done.

The problem is, I have given a goal to release this app, and I thought it was a smaller goal that it is.

## 2025-09-15  Limited success last week; redouble this week

- I did clean the house/yard
- I did dig deep on the forum
- I did not have a good plan for applying
- I did not have a do great in exercise
- I did not do great learning new stuff

- Solo parent this week.
- Yashins push for me on forum last week.

- **Focus this week**:
	- whole body/life - exercise & time w Eli
	- applying plan/action
	- learning stuff


## H3 headings

### 2025-09-08  No Plan no progress

- Killing TOO MUCH TIME on my hook anchor
- Don't have plan for the week
- Not jumping in quickly during the day

I know what to do, I am just not doing it.
I think I need to start small, but push each day to grow this habit.

will check in daily on this during this week:
- M: Started slow, limited hook anchor stuff in the way
- 

### 2025-09-02  Few MIT targets

- Sleep is better, motivation is better.
- This week I want to set several MIT tasks & hit them
- Need to feel the "wins" of doing what I am saying
- Need to work on important items



### 2025-08-25  Daily Reflection on Approach, Emotions, and Outcomes
- M:  Sunday night nose-dive watching TV. ==> edit my alarm settings, and then really follow them.  May be hard 2night I am a little off schedule.

### 2025-08-11  Well I am doing better on sleep!

Having this PKM app is taking up much more time than anticipated.


### 2025-08-05  Not being disciplined about sleep & work

I need to focus on process more than ouput.
I need to build rhythm, hope, backbone.
Need to have modest but real deliverables each week, then drive towards achieving them.


### 2025-07-28  (1) A Plan, (2) time on task, (3) stop hacking before dinner!

- Get an achievable plan for the week.
- Put in 3 hrs per day on MIT
- Stop hacking before dinner
	- Very quick fixes.  Set timer for 10-15min.


### 2025-07-24  Feel better this morning, but emotions are very shaky
- I don't see the future for Engineering-IC AI for me, and Eng Mgr seems vacent and hard to get even when it comes back
- Chief AI officer seems better.  and for the moment I am excited to build towards that, and can imag [[Reflections]]<br>                                                                                                                             kflip, and maybe the enthusiasm to learn then execute the job.
- maybe...     

### 2025-07-11  MWF 1h minimum on Contacts.  
- My idea is that it might be in-bound looking at linkedin
- Scanning my LAMP list and taking action, or
- Looking at my [[ping]] list and operating from that.


### 2025-07-08  Great sleep w/ hope; Need to lean into strengths; will find job

Nick suggests I don't consider consulting as this is not leaning into what has worked for me in the past.
He notes when I am 

### 2025-07-01  Sleep seems better.  MIT time is still bad.

### 2025-06-24  Tomorrow
I will do better tomorrow.

### 2025-06-16  steps taken

- worked out on Sunday
- broadening list of areas I am aiming to make progress in.
- got moving quickly today
- trying to frame small actionable items in each key area and get high efficiency in my day across 4-5 big areas.

Here is the top of the [[Bkt]] list nwo

### 2025-06-12  Tiny Step
==> My tiny step here is to have an MIT list of time-bound activities.
==> Each day do one 90 hit of these, and exercise as the basis of my day.  will try to add on to that to round out the day.



### 2025-06-10  Flailing

Wow am I flailing.  I have very bad patterns of daily activity.
I am procrastinating worse than I ever can remember doing.
I am stressed that this job market is too hard and I am too misaligned.

Sometimes I feel things will be ok-e.  I have many goals, but they are parts of very large buckets.

==> One idea is to set specific goals for each day, and push to achieve those
maybe I will even do that for the rest of to hole gently.
get some low bar wins...
going to bed


### 2025-05-29  No More
No More
- empty days

How do I want to feel?
- Alive.  At work, at home, in bed.
- Impactful.  My actions are not hurried, or crowded, but are impactful.

What do I do daily?
- Exercise

Values?


Red Pen?
- Free Cell, procrastination

Experiment

Tell a new story

Build a new ecosystem



### 2025-05-19  This week:  Push self on MIT time; Fun many days; Exercise
### 2025-05-12  Need to center on actionable short-term outcomes.  Need to upgrade my optimism.  Need to limit targets.

Trying to implement [[HABIT SAVERS]] habit

### 2025-05-05  .

### 2025-04-22  .

### 2025-03-31  Crashing and Burning.  What may come from the ashes?

- I am less and less able to accomplish anything.  Anything at all!
- I need to make incremental progress each day on A, B, and C I this will relieve stress.  

RESOLUTIONS
- SLACK:  I need to cut myself some slack.  I have $3M in the bank and QL and I together have $5M, all will be ok.
- FOCUS: I need to ensure key things are attended to weekly:   (a) Health, (b) Fun, (c) Job, (d) Career, Work, Home
- SMART: I need to have s.m.a.r.t. goals in my key areas.
- CONFIDENCE: I need to build confidence by daily progress in 

### 2025-03-17  Really off track & what to do.

In all areas, I think I am just demoralized.  I know that I am not making good progress. I think the wall emotionally looks too large, so I am sticking my head in the sand.

Thoughts:

==> BUILD SYSTEMS: I need to build systems that are self-working and cause me to get productive work done each day.  When I do get productive work done, I immediately feel more optimistic, but when I don't, it quickly collapses.

==> LOWER RISK OUTCOMES: During this time, I need to build some lower-risk outcomes that are still acceptable, even if not ideal. Then, I can shoot for higher-risk ones at the same time.

==> HAVE FUN:  I presently have little to look forward to each week.  Reading sci-fi is my only luxury.  That is pretty thin.  I need more.

### 2025-03-03  Depressed?  Demoralized?

- I get so little work done in a week, but I seem to be "working" all the time.
- When I think about my waking hours I do end up frittering away 30-50% of them.

Approach this week:
1. Have achievable goals in 4-6 key directions
2. Figure out some 'fun' to do each day or every other day.
3. Get MIT task going first each day


TO NICK:
I have a general sense that my priorities are correct and my time on task is not great.  that is my focus right now.  As far as concrete actions here are my targets this week:
- NETWORKING - Have 3-5 networking connections/meetings setup (includes companies and people)
- TIER II TARGETS - Finish building my tier 2 companies target list. 
- COURSE - Finish another Andrew Ng deep learning course.
- PAPERS - Read 3-5 AI papers/blogs
- SPORTS VISIO - Do an all-day management meeting on Wednesday.  Prepare the 2025 AI plan for that meeting.

Last week, the task of building my Tier II list grew in complexity.  it has taken longer than I initially expected to do this task.  Still, I think it is good work.  My main complaint is that time on task is not where it needed to be last week -- I think part of the issue is just life tasks taking time.  (e.g., half a day lost taking Eli around town and not being fully engaged in the task). this week, I am trying to find a couple of 'fun' activities for my week... it has been too long since I did anything that I personally wanted.  Also, I am not attending to my general health (exercise), and I think that ties to motivation too.

How about you?  what are your tasks, and how do you feel about progress?

### 2025-01-06  Done By One
I am working too much on SV and not on NJ

- Done by one.  Includes my breakfast at 11
- Then 30-min focused NJ work starting 12-2p

### 2025-01-03  Get Serious About Interviewing

- Schedule interviews
- Schedule meetings w/ mentors
- Train many days
- Drop hours on SV.  Done by 12

### 2025-01-03  NEW YEARS RESOLUTION -- Get Healthy!

- Exercise 4 days per week at least 40 minutes
- Strength training 1 per week
- Max heart rate 1 per week



### 2024-12-16  Need to push for specific targets for a day or period

- Had luck when I pushed to get code ready for Juan... ended work hard into the night, but was very productive
- Caused next day to be productive too (maybe)
- Pushed to get range of home project done by end of day on Monday.  again felt good and was productive.


Generally before I was not getting time on impt stuff, but when I do, real progress is made


### 2024-11-26 DEEP WORK discussion w/ Yashin

In answer to your question below I will tell you what I am working on in my journey as it seems relevant for you.
I read an article about “deep work” and in it the author claimed that your output is related to the amount of deep work you do, and the busy work can easily eclipse the deep work and you get nothing done.
I think this is true of me, so I broadly bucket work into “chew” tasks
These are true work tasks, and needed for my job, but they are kind of house keeping tasks like reading emails/slacks and quick responses.

Then I have “deep” tasks, and these are:
- big deliverables (couple of hours minimum) 
- that require focus.  (Often they are tasks that I have been procrastinating or are mentally hard)
- they are especially important relative to other ‘chew’ tasks
- they represent key outputs that would cause me to say “oh I made good progress today”
   (Example: Email is essential, still if I dispatch is in quick and sloppy it can be ok, so they are not deep.)


This split is pretty clear for me.  If it is a big rock that was defined at beginning of week as a key item, then it is a “deep” task, else it is not.

Now I try to optimize my day so I can get a couple of deep hours per day.  And I take notice when other tasks are drowning out my deep tasks.  This is helpful since now it causes me to push chew tasks to the back burner, when in the past I would often do them first, and just try to move faster.  Now they start dropping of the plate, but deep tasks get done.

  

At least that is the theory…. And so far it is starting to work.
### 2024-11-18  Exercise

It is just not happening.

Rule To Try: 
- if prior day was a miss and
- emergency is not underway 
- and "exercise last chance"
- Then drop all and exercise


### 2024-11-12  Hackers was fun/energizing.  I am credible 4 many jobs
### 2024-11-03  COMPLETION - Pick things to finish; then finish them!

- Just finished the basement, felt pretty great.
- I am in shooting distance to finishing my car and resume.
==> I need to pick items to 'finish' at least to some specific level of done.  then do it!

### 2024-10-21  Focus on deep work hours & emotional stance & fun


### 2024-10-14  MY PROBLEM & AN IDEA

PROBLEM: Without strong focus, i can easily:
- Spend 4 or so hours doing shallow work & Repeated tasks (like eating)
- And spend 4 or so hours frittered away on non work (like browsing) each day
- These leave scant hours for IMPORTANT and DEEP work

SOLUTION:
- Contain shallow work.  Plan few bursts.  Focus on quality over quantity.  
- Enjoy the rest of your day.

ONE APPROACH
- 8	shallow.		Contain required shallow work from 8a-10a when possible
- 10	Burst-1.		1hr burst 'till 11am
- 11	Rest/Eat. 	
- 12 Burst-2.		1.5hr
- 1:	Lunch/Chew.
- 3	Burst-3.		1hr
- 4	Exercise.


### 2024-09-09  Went to 1/2 time at SV

The idea going 1/2 time is that 
- I really WILL re-coup at least 1/3 time in order to job search
- I will be able to keep Jason happy and look good
- I will still be able to spend a bit of time getting more technical --modest time
- I will be able to swing back to full time and stay at SV in the unlikely event that I want to do that

mostly unclear if I can re-tool enough to change the kinds of jobs I can get.

A little optimistic but also apprehensive about my upcoming job search

### 2024-08-22  My Biggest Issue: Daily hours on MIT

I am stressed on a daily basis, and I think the biggest stressor is lack of progress on my job search.  This is because I don't work on it.

I really need to re-shape how I work so that I DO work on my MIT task both for work and for next job.

UPSIDE: The good news is that this is an absolutely essential skill if I am to successfully make a transition to a strong next job.  

DOWNSIDE:  And my big challenge is that I don't think I have ever been good at doing this
### 2024-08-14  Stressed & Procrastinating

Well I am procrastinating right now!

I am stressed that 
- Jason does not find full value from me at Sports Visio, AND 
- I am going to have difficulty finding a good job in this market, AND 
- I have missed the boat in doing research which I trained for and like doing.

I don't think it is as bad as all of that.  I think I am painting an overly negative picture, 
But emotionally this is the way things feel, and there is at least some truth the picture.

As a result I am pushing things off,
not getting to the most important stuff, and
not working enough focused hours per day.

**My plan**:

Each day I need to put in at least 3 hours on key activities
Never below 2 and trying to hit 4.





### 2024-06-08  Saying Goodbye to Yoshiko



Yoshiko its Dan.

The drifted apart
- not impt part of my life.
- on my list to re-connect
- young son
- I guess this voice message will have to do

Thinking back there are alot of happy memories
- simple ones like your dinners prepared with care for when I would travel to Princeton for the weekend.
- The way you were always so so crazy happy if I would repair anything.  I think your plan was to make me feel like a complete genius... and it really kinda worked!
- mom's wrapping
- ashley's rememberance
- my high sc [[Reflections]]<br>
-                                                                                                                                                              I knew it at the time, but I never really appreciated it!

You are a ray of sunshine to every person in your life.  Your smile, and your presence as soon as you would walk into a room.  everyone could feel it.

It was great to have that as part of my life.  A crazy rare gift actually.  More anything else, you are a walking ball of joy, and it makes the time anyone spends around you joyful.  

I was damn lucky to experience that, I miss it, and I will always miss it, and miss you.

I will never forget you Yoshiko, my big yellow birdie.
Lots of love always. 
-- dan



Hey this is Dan, Yoshiko's boyfriend from years ago  (I think you will remember me from my stay at your parents house and the trip where I took you and Yoshiko to Eiheiji temple). I am so shocked to learn that Yoshiko is                                                                                                                                                                               f you could play it for her.  I wish I could tell her in person!  I am happy for any details if you think she was or wasn't able to hear it.  This is all so so sad!

Yours, 
Dan






~~
Yoshiko, it's Dan Ablinger from New York City. I heard just recently, a couple days ago actually, some shocking news that you're in hospice and very ill. I still can't quite believe it. I know you were running races and I don't know, it's very hard for me to imagine. Okay. It's been, it's been more than 10 years, I think, since the last time we spoke. I never intended to, to let us drift apart. The truth is when I started doing startups out here in California, I actually drifted away from a lot of my friends. And you were on my list to reconnect to, for the last two years. I really felt like there was one or two things that, that I wanted to say to you, when reconnecting. And, well, I guess this voice message will have to do. You know, I'm just kind of thinking back on our time together. There's really were a lot of happy memories. Most of them were very simple things. I remember the way you were just so crazy happy if I would repair anything. I don't know. I fixed a window at one time and I remember there was something electric. I remember what it was. Each time you feel like a complete genius. I think it was your plan, but it kind of worked. My mom still remembers and often will say something at Christmas time when we're wrapping up the gifts. I don't know if you remember, but that was your job when you were in town. Well, gifts definitely haven't been wrapped as precisely. More beautifully is that. Since then. And my cousin Ashley, I don't know if you remember her, she was young, she was probably eight. No, maybe a little bit more, maybe ten. When you were coming for Christmases. And to her you were the cosmopolitan woman. And so, I don't know, she always would refer back to you and say that. That she kind of wanted to be like you. I mean, she's since grown and probably grown out of that. But that was her memory. I remember my high school reunion, I don't know if you remember, we're on a boat. And you're very gregarious and very happy. And so, still now when I go back to my reunions, my classmates all remember you. And ask after you. But the reason I wanted to connect back, I did feel like there was something that ought to have been said. It's not exactly an apology. It's just, I was very unaware. Unaware of what I had in you. At the time, I knew it, but I just didn't appreciate it. You're very much a ray of sunshine for anybody. Your smile when you go into a room, lights the room up. Everybody can feel it. And it's a presence that I enjoy for a while. But never really. Appreciate it. And realize this over the years, as I just think back to all the different people I've known in my life, that really it's a crazy, rare gift. You're a walking ball of joy, and it makes the time that people spend around you joyful. I was damn lucky to experience that. I'll miss it. I'll always miss it and I'll miss you. I'll never forget you, Yoshiko. My big yellow birdie. Lots of love. Always. Dan. Okay. Okay.

~~
Yo Shiko, this is Dan, Dan Ablinger from New York City. I just heard that you're in hospice and very ill. I was shocked to hear this. I knew that you had been running races not so long ago, so I couldn't quite believe it. It's been more than a decade since we last talked. And I never imagined that we would just drift apart and not talk. I guess my startup world had me moving away from a lot of my friends. I had the idea that I would reconnect with you over the last year or two. Over and over I kind of thought this was an important thing to do just because we were close and I think there was a few things left unsaid. At this point I guess this message is going to have to do since I've missed my chance for that. I was thinking back on a lot of the happy memories from the time we were together. Really just simple ones like the dinners that you prepared for when I would travel to Princeton for the weekend. They were simple but it was very nice. I was always so crazy happy if I would repair anything. I think it was your way of making me feel like a complete genius. It really worked. I don't know. I think I fixed your water at one point. I fixed something electrical. I can't remember what it was. You were just so happy about it. My mom still mentions you're wrapping. I don't know if you remember, but. Coming to my mom's house for Christmas, your job was always to wrap the gifts and you're quite precise about that. So they've not been wrapped as well since then. My cousin, I don't remember if you remember her. She was very young when you were there, but you were the cosmopolitan woman for her. her. So she's often... said things back to me, just asking about you years later. Of course, she's married now and has kids, but she still remembers. And when I go back to my high school reunion, if you remember when you were here, we went to my high school reunion and your gregarious smile definitely had lasting impact on on the folks that we met then. Then. But more than anything else, there was one thing I wanted to tell you that I felt needed to be said and it's one of the reasons I wanted to get back in contact with you. It's not exactly an apology, but years later looking at it, I knew at the time how special it was, your way of being, but I never appreciate. The reality is, you were a ray of sunshine for me, but for anybody in your life. Your smile and your presence when you came into a room, everybody could feel it. All of my friends felt it, everybody knew it, all of your friends of course knew it, and I was blessed by it and I really took it for granted. And that was the reason I'm not sure. I wanted to get back in touch with you. I felt like, I don't know, just that it was not handled well by me. I think it's a crazy, rare gift. And there's nothing more to say about it. I'm just sorry that I wasn't more appreciative when I had the chance. I was damn lucky to experience it. and I'll miss it and I'll miss you. I'll never forget you Yoshiko. Lots of love always. Bye bye. Okay.


### 2024-05-03  The way you work.... and don't work

- Under the gun, you perform
- When inspired you perform
- But after a period you take a break, and it all falls apart
  you blow out, with many hours frittered away, not with fun, but with distraction.

- But "fun" with family is not "fun"...  you rarely plan fun


### 2024-04-01  Control from topdown lists

- TOP DOWN CLEAN UP -
  Strong feeling of control from organizing / cleaning lists from top down.
- RAPID DELEGATE - 
  Strong feeling of velocity from rapidly tasking and delegating stuff to team members.
- top MANAGERS BRIONES & JUAN - 
  Velocity from setting up Briones and Juan.



### 2024-03-04  Occasional Loss of Traction;  now building BKT tree

- Sometimes I am pretty effective, and sometimes I will just loose 4 hours.

==> I know I need to "eat the frog" everyday...  this will really help.
==> I know I need built tree of actions so I have high ROI actions always ready to go
	- Need to better manage my transitions between activities




### 2024-01-28  Starting to feel caught up

I am going to bed by 11pm, and sometimes waking by 6am, this makes sleeping better and gives me some extra room some days.

- I am cranking thru my lists to delete stuff of finish stuff
- work lists is getting clean, starting to hit other lists.
- need to get 1-2h per day on personal stuff to clear the decks.
- Feel better now that schools are applied for, really was not such a big deal once we got to it.  (though QL was the one that actually filled them out!)


### 2024-01-02  the 2024 life reset

- Build sustained, effective action
- Focus on key things most impt in ALL areas
- Live a little



### 2023-12-04  Depressive-time-suck

Sunday was a pretty big waste.
- Just not motivated so I kill many hours watching TV or reading/write on Medium
- Need to organize fun into my week so I am motivated
- Need to really organize my energies into actionable channels, so I make bite-sized progress in key areas so I feel better.
  Adding this to [[Full]] section.


### 2023-11-27  Obispo-Trip.  am I depressed?

Travelled to Saint Louis Obispo over the weekend.
Being on the beach with Eli was fun, but in general these days I have little motivation to do hard things.

I think I need to focus on growing this motivation
I need to re-frame what really matters to me.

I think my motivation is low, because clarity of my mission is so poor.


Too many things have been accepted... too many abstract plans to someday fix all of them.

Feels overwhelming... I play solitaire instead!

### 2023-11-07  Two Blistering Avoidance Failures:  Eating the Frog.  Exercising.

My ability to push myself is just not strong, if I have some activity that I am avoiding then I really go into a tail spin and just never do the activity.


### 2023-08-21  Gratitude Meditation; Feeling valued @ work

Gratitude meditation course is giving a new view on my day to day.
I do have much to be happy with, and much to enjoy with Eli.

And for my present role at SV, I am delivering a ton of value, and I am recognized for that value.  So I think I need to relax away from the stress regarding this topic.

Today did have a small backdrop of stress, as I am just "on" and pushing the whole day.  I like the task of getting folks moving on the "ingest" problem @ work, but still it is novel for me to be pushing the ball on so many things at once.  I need to learn how to manage this w/ less stress.

### 2023-06-20  A HAH - Treadmill

I am living on a self-inflicted treadmill.
I never feel I am remotely caught up.

Key Issue:
- I do chew first, thus prime things slip so I feel/am behind
- If prime things are not fun enough, wont do them
  need to shape aims to be more fun, or drop them

Approach:
- Do prime things first, chew will slip, thats ok
- Radical streamlining of prime list needed
	- Drop many things
	- Do others FAST, with 80/20 thinking
	- Delegate, Multitask, Track

- Less Is More.  Be happy with less done & planned
- Broaden list of things getting 'prime' time





### 2023-06-20  Work First; Streamlining; 

Observation:  All of my chew tasks eat up much of my prime working time, and I am not getting important stuff done.

Proposed Approach:
- Meetings - My day typically begins with 1-2 hours of meetings.
- Flash Check - based on email senders and slack channel I *ONLY* look for emergencies, usual there are few/none.
- Prime - Then I try to work on any F1 tasks under work, now, or week
- Eat - While reading or fun chew tasks
- Chew - Daily & Chew tasks are done in the afternoon/evening

This week I am getting more 'prime' tasks done.  Still not as many hours as I hope.  BUT
It really helped that this weekend I really cleaned up my F1 lists well so things are organized.
Still don't feel like I am quite getting as much prime tasks as I hope, but definitely way more (than the typical ZERO from before)

Makes me realize I need to streamline my prime and chew tasks dramatically.
Makes me realize I can achieve SO much more, by saying no, by delgating, by being intelligent, by streamlining tasks.

==> Need to start adding:  Startup thinking, and Networking thinking to my weekly mix
==> Need further steamlining first, and need to get small tactical plans for these activities



### 2023-04-24  Lesson Learned:  I am too tactical, too insecure, not proactive @ high level, & running from fear


- GUT KNOWLEDGE - I have known from the start that my position seemed untenable, 
- AVOIDANCE RESPONSE - But I ran from this issue rather than confronting it.
- ***SHINY THINGS - I worked furiously on other things instead of the key thing that needed fixing***.   <--- key point
- INSECURE - I am insecure in feeling I needed more coding & algo strength than I now do for the CTO job
  INSECURE - Not acknowledging broad strengths that others see in me.
  INSECURE - in feeling that I am "not worth" the extra equity over Mike/Brian
- NOT TALKING - Not talking with Jason/sam nearly enough
- NOT SEEING - Jason feels isolated at the top, and I should have seen this


NEED TO GROW A PAIR! - Just assume I am amazing and can own any piece that is needed, and figure out what is really needed here.



### 2023-04-12  PIVOT - shift towards AI




### 2023-04-04  STRESS!  Feel my path AT SV is time limited


I have never jumped into a job more fervently than at SV.
I feel I am provided value and help



### 2023-03-31  Week travel to Disney

Trip to Disney was a great way to spend time with Eli and QL.
I was able to enjoy the trip, and QL gave me time to work too.

I am feeling like I can get on top of my job with enough room left over to start taking on the rest of life.

But I need to use the same efficiencies to other parts of life in order to get them to fit into available time.  My three strategies:
- Just say 'no' - find ways to get stuff off my lists.
- Put in more hours - avoid frittered time, and get more time in.
- Get obsidian organized about all these areas, so with limited time I can dispatch the core stuff in efficient ways

==> Want to make progress of 'self' items, and want to have feeling of spare time... just small amounts, but not the feeling of overwhelm that I have had my whole adult life.



### 2023-03-21  Back from all hands; feeling of efficiency coming!


Wow, my ability to execute feels stronger and strong by the day!

OBSERVATION:  I *am* a cat person, I DIVE on a juicy problem that looks like it is just about to get away with fervor!  But I often want to jump from task to task, w/o specific timeline (except for move FASTER).  But I tire of working on the same task for too many hours.  I am happiest to have a rotation of five all in motion.


Still, my execution is very dependent upon avoidance of too many meetings.  Still building that muscle.

Also I should take extra care to be humble as I am feeling stronger and stronger in my ability to execute.
I think there is a risk that my confidence will spill over into a kind of patronizing of Jason, or riding rough on Mike.



### Dream: "what am I getting myself into"

Woke this morning with a feeling that doing the "crush it" talk in Argentina that I am signing myself up to be a maniac worker for the next many years.

Maybe I am to some degree, but I do need to deliver value, and this is one kind of value I can deliver.  I still think I can shape the job stay out of many of the weeds, AND get stronger in CV at the same time.


worried about this issue, but I am hopeful I can manage it.

And it is part of an evolving picture of what I can deliver in future jobs too.  My biggest worry is that I will only earn 200-300K at SV but need more in order to retire well.





### 2023-03-01  Mid Week - Different kind of tracking
- Before SV I needed to track that I was getting stuff done each day
- Now I am "running hot" with many actions happening each day
- But not necessarily the most important actions happening all the time
- Idea: track 'buckets' of activity in order to ensure good percentage is going in best directions

### 2023-02-27  Week 2 at SV 

- **EFFECTIVE** - For the first time in a long time I feel like I am being particularly effective with my time.  Why?
	- DELEGATE - I quickly cut to the nub of many issues, so I can delegate quickly.  and I LIKE delegating.
	- FIREHOSE - I like surfing many different issues, and putting bits of high value time against them.
	- CAT - I get to choose which task I will add value, how and when.
	- TEMPO - stuff happening is at a high tempo; it puts me into a high tempo

- **MY VALUE** - I went from feeling insecure in what value I might bring to SV, into a mode where it is clear of the value that I can bring on a sustained basis, and how I am able to "level up" my value, by getting to the top of the pyramid in all areas:
	- Low-hours, high-coverage tracking of ALL of SW Execution
	- Occasional collaborative creation of processes across ALL of SW and ALL of the Company
	- Investor Relations, Fund raising, 
	- Planning/Managing/Execution/Delivery of high value planning, and projects  (e.g. Bridge Round Prep)


I think/hope I can quickly become super time efficient at juggling many balls and have spare time/energy for growth and other things.
Controlling my time & deliveries is key to delivering high value & having spare energy/time

This job is fun, and jobs like this will continue to be fun.

Maybe I supplement this job to make a high income?
