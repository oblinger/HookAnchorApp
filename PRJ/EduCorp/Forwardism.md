# Forwardism

## Introduction

Those who call for the end of capitalism and the current world order would do well to deeply understand an love the many incredible benefits capitalism has brought to humanity.  We literally cannot LIVE without many of these benefits.  Simply over throwing the current system would yield chaos and widespread death as the many needs of the 8 BILLIONS humans on earth would not be met is a gruesome mad-max, hunger-games kind of way.

Still with this tribute in place, we are going to let's call it like we see it: capitalism has an evil seed buried right in its very center.  This evil pervades and perverts all aspects of the capital system.  Here we first identify this evil seed, and then go on to try to envision a system that weaves benefits from many systems use today into a system ejects this evil seen from its core:

## The promise and perils of capitalism

POST CAPITALISM 
- CAPITALISM 
	- Modern corporations have a fiduciary duty to legally maximize shareholder value.
	- Additional considerations (like benefit to the employee or society) only have value to the extent that they somehow indirectly benefit shareholder value.  
	- Capitalism slaves assets and labor for solve benefit of capital itself.
	- According to modern corporate theory, the board of directors has a fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder value.
	- Shareholder value (and applicable laws) reigns supreme as the sole and ultimate arbiter of "correct" action.
	- Capitalism seeks to enslave labor in service of slave to capital.
	- Capitalism slaves both assets and labor in the sole pursuit of maximizing the concentration of that capital.
	- Capitalism enslaves labor to capital in pursuit of increased capital.
	- Capitalism seeks to slave both assets and labor to capital in pursuit of increased capital.

- Sustainable Differentiation - 

- FORWARDISM
	- Seeks to maximize the number successful entrepreneurs (member beneficiaries), while minimizing the number who fail in the attempt.
	- Seeks to maximize the number of self sustaining, thriving participants, while minimizing the number who fail in the attempt.
	- Like capitalism it is a self-amplifying system


RETAINS MANY ADVANTAGES OF PRIOR SYSTEMS: Entitlements, Unions, Corporations, Market Systems
- SELF-AMPLIFYING - Capitalism is a self-amplifying system.  This is critical for any system seeking humanity-scale change, the funds needed for any such endevor must come from the change itself.  No other source can scale with the problem being tackled.
- SELF-CORRECTING - 
- BOTTOM-UP DECENTRALIZED - 
- MAXIMIZES - 
- COLLECTIVE - Builds upon notions of collective action underlying labor unions, but forwardism seeks benefit to leverage that collective power in 
- ENTITLEMENTS - Like entitlements, forwardism seeks to provide benefit to ever larger numbers of beneficaries.
- OWNERSHIP / 
- EMPOWERMENT
