# Edu Corp Whitepaper

::: {.author}
_Contractually and Culturally Mandated “Pay It Forward”_
:::

Empowering those without opportunity but with motivation and potential but to create opportunities for themselves and others, by providing the (1) funds, (2) training, and (3) network to create ones own business.

## INTRODUCTION

In many parts of the world one can readily find people with aptitude and high motivation who are nonetheless frittering decades of their lives away ineffectively struggling against poverty.  They merely lack the proper context for success, otherwise they would be wildly successful.  What a terrible waste of human potential! 

It is this high-motivation-with-aptitude subset of the disadvantaged that Edu Corp seeks to lift from their poverty.  Edu Corp targets this group specifically because it can use their future earning potential as a means of funding the entire process.

The result is a system whose total costs ramps DOWN TO ZERO as the number of people lifted from poverty GROWS UPWARD.  Traditional benefit organization’s naturally have costs that GO UP as the number of people helped go up.  This is just crazy!  How can Edu Corp’s costs go in the other direction?!  This document explains how.

In principle there is no limit to the number who can be lifted without cost.

In practice the two limiting factors are:
- The number of disadvantaged with aptitude and motivation
- Availability of new profitable, scalable businesses


### The Edu Corp Mission

The **_Edu Corp mission_** is to _maximize_ the number of successful entrepreneurs and corporations it creates while also _minimizing_ the number of failed entrepreneurs and corporations that happen along the way.

There are other considerations (like not breaking laws, students not having miserable lives, etc.) that also drive Edu Corp’s behavior, still it is helpful to spell out this prime optimization criteria up front, since it underlies many of the design decisions baked into the entire Edu Corp model.

### The Edu Corp Principles

At its core, Edu Corp is a cultural/contracting/incentivizing mechanism that drives the creation of employee-owned corporations in a self-propagating, ever-amplifying wave.

The following four bedrock principles serve as a guide in developing the specific cultural/contractual details of Edu Corp:

(a)   **Individual autonomy** – At any moment each individual is free to act in their own personal best interest, even if those actions are not the expected progression of the Edu Corp model and even if those actions directly conflict with Edu Corps stated mission.  They might leave their cohort to form a competing business using the knowledge they have gained here.  They might refuse to co-sign underclassman loans at the last minute.  They might vote to eject others from their corporation or stall the whole school and simply reap profits from the labor of their underclassman.  Of course, these actions are not encouraged!  Still business is complex, and there can be valid reasons for each of these (and many other) unexpected actions.  Edu Corp does not attempt to legislate against these actions.  Quite the opposite, it embraces the centrality of individual choice and simply ensures that contracts and incentives are in place at all steps of the process to fairly compensate the individuals in question and the system, against all these possible futures.  This is tricky stuff!  Still, we believe a framework centered on individual autonomy is a more robust solution than trying to legislate correct behavior top-down under all possible future cases and edge cases.

(b)  **Bottom-up decision making** – a second related tenet of the Edu Corp system is that of bottom-up decision making. Nearly all major actions happening in the Edu Corp system are emergently determined bottom up.  This include deciding who should receive loans, deciding when a cohort is ready for graduation, deciding who should be selected for which future role or what compensation should be afforded for these unique roles are ALL determined in a  many different paths is determined in a bottoms up emergent fashion.  Individuals make individual choices and global outcomes, and pricing all follow from these choices.  In order to obtain the desired overall behavior, we must arrange incentives and contractual structures in ways that drive effective collective behavior from these individual choices.  This requires correctly structured contracts.

(c)   **Robustness to reality** – Breakdowns, stalls, and failures of one kind or another are possible at each stage in the lifecycles of these school-businesses, this is reality.  And real dollars, real assets, real personal livelihoods will be on the line.  Contracts need to be in place ensuring that fair ownership and fair fiscal responsibility is laid upon each person in each micro-step in the process, since we cannot know how or when such breakdowns might occur.

(d)  **Collaborative, win-win culture** – With all this talk of individual autonomy & self-serving actions it might seem Edu Corp is designed to be a hyper competitive winner-take-all environment.  The opposite is true, both the culture and the incentives of Edu Corp are constructed to reward win-win constructive behavior.  The system’s incentives aim to maximize the number of successful businesses and entrepreneurs produced while minimizing the number of failed businesses and failed entrepreneurs that happen along the way.  Getting a head in this system requires helping other get a head too.  This is encouraged both contractually and culturally.


### Motivating Examples

**SIMPLIFIED GRADUATION-DAY CONTRACTING**

Before diving into the very deep rabbit hole of complex corporate restructuring contracts that are required for some self-propagating business creation waves.  It is important to note that Edu Corp also has a “low road” contractual progression process that can be used in the simplest cases.  In cases where (1) the school is remaining intact with only standard depreciation occurring on its value, and (2) when the newly formed sub-corporation is not taking significant assets from the school.  In this case, simple billet price negotiation (shown below), along with standardized school price depreciation will be sufficient to generate all contracts for graduation-day loans.  This process can become more of a “rubber stamping” affair in these simple cases.  For complex business restructuring this simple model will not apply.  The remainder of this document is dedicated to these more complex contracting cases.

**MORE COMPLEX CORPORATE STRUCTURING EXAMPLES**  
The fully general Edu Corp progression model can be shockingly complex; it includes considerations for the propagation of all manner of businesses with all manner of requirements and risks.  Fortunately, this complexity can be layered onto the simplest contracting in an a-la-carte fashion adding only the complexity required for a particular kind of business context.  In this section we provide a several motivating examples of business complexity which can be referred to in subsequent sections.

**A BASE CASE**
The Call School is a call center and a school for training others to set up their own call center.  The call school specializes in smaller centers located in smaller towns closer to the local talent.  The school is owned by its senior cohort, who have travelled to live at the school while getting trained.  On graduation day they get loans to create their own school back home, and they sell the school onward its junior class.  These contracts are simple since the origination loans for the school are simply transferred to the junior class, as the junior class takes ownership and control.  This just ensures the assets of the school don’t “walk away” and are well cared for, since they are always owned by the senior class.

**MULTIPLYING LIKE BUNNIES**
Edu Corp realizes there is enormous potential for these remote call centers, and wants to produce more of them per month, so it publishes a ‘billet’ for a call center school to split off into a second school instead of splitting off a business.  This is harder and costs more, so it adds a $50K positive bias as an incentive on this billet.  The 5th generation owners of the Call Center couldn’t resist the $50K so the agree to create Calls Central in a distant city (to avoid competing for students too badly).

**END OF LIFE**
After many hundreds of small call center businesses have been created, it is clear this market is being saturated, and further growth is going to threaten the entire sector.  As Edu Corp saw this happening is created a new termination billet that had no requirement to create a sub corporation, instead the school just revert into a call center business (which it already is!).  Since this billet is much easier than the standard propagation billet, Edu Corp added a significant _negative billet bias_ so that all school would not try to stop at the same time.  Then over time it reduced this negative bias allowing more and more schools to simply convert into stable businesses.

**COMPLEX CORP SPLITTING**  
A tomato farm school is splitting off a farming sub-corporation that is leasing land close by.  The junior cohorts have agreed the sub-corporation will own the old tilling equipment and will lease this back to the school for the next three years, while the school saves for more modern equipment.  Most of the customers will stay with the school, but to new contracts that seem like they have lots of potential for adjacent growth will transfer to the sub-corp.  To defray costs half the junior class joining the new corporation will remain at the school for 9 months while they help train and work.  On the second harvest they will all finally move to the new corp.  The new Corp will delay land leasing until ¼ of the way thru the first growing season and have rights to grow their seedlings in planters at the school for up to one month beyond taking possession of their land.  All these complex negotiations where managed by the two junior cohorts who, during negotiations, did not yet know if they were the cohort to remain that the school or would be the ones forming the corporation.  Once the splitting contracts were finalized, the two cohorts used _counterweight bidding_ to determine the payments between school and new Corp to correctly balance this complex array of plusses and minuses. 

**THE BUSINESS BACK FLIP**
After years of successful small farm creation.  Edu Corp sees an opportunity to move into building construction, so it researches ideal markets and find appropriate training partners and training materials.  Then they publish a “crazy” _billet_ for some farming school to learn enough about building to train an incoming class into a whole new business.  This is very risky move since they will eventually co-sign _graduation-loans_ for their underclassman to create their new business!  But there is great value to the Edu Corp ecosystem if it can leapfrog into a completely new industry.  The farm school will need significant new assets trucks, tools, etc. to even be able to train their incoming class.  Thus, this crazy billet comes with upfront seed funding from the _forward fund_, as well as a moderate line of credit also from the forward fund.  This billet additionally includes $250K _positive biasing_ as an enticement for taking on all this additional risk.  Still Edu Corp now needs to worry that a school might say “sure we will give it a try,” enjoy themselves while burning thru the provided seed funding but give up at the first setback.  So, the billet also comes with a notably stiff $100K _forward-failure_ loan amount.  Any school grabbing for that tasty $250K positive biasing, better be ready grunt it out, and try to make this building school WORK!

**MANAGEMENT MESS**
Building Co has just never been that well managed, and its culture is shaky at best.  They can build houses, but few students really want to join, and their churn with students leaving to join other schools is dramatic.  They have trained several students up to the junior level, but it this point they are ready to give up the ghost, and declare failure, they are not going create a sub-corporation as they committed to.  Thus, the senior cohort will pay the portion of their forward loans associated with selling the school to their junior class (since they are not going to do that).  They will get credit for a new corporation since they will now become that corporation.  And about half of the seniors will not need to pay forward failures for their co-signing part of their forward loan, since the underclassman they have already agree to co-sign with transfer to other schools where they will complete their training.  This cohort is not paying it forward in the expected way, but they are still paying it forward by other means.  There still functioning corporation will these forward failure loans after they pay their progression loans.

**FORWARD FAILURES**  
Overnight the COVID pandemic has dramatically reduced housing new starts, the booming business of creating new construction companies all the sudden looks very mis guided.  Several schools are escaping this fate, by applying for a new billet to convert to a non-building related school, while others simply decided to pay the forward failure loan and renege on their promise to create new businesses.  Because this situation is so clearly onside the control of these businesses, Edu Corp decided to cut the forward failure loan by 50%, they are still paying for the failure, just much less than expected.

A FINAL NOTE:  Edu Corp should never use its many incentive and contractual levers to encourage businesses to make the “right” choices for those businesses as Edu Corp sees it. Instead, Edu Corp should its market intelligence directly to its schools and then let them choose paths forward as they see fit.  Edu Corp should only use these incentives in cases where it sees paths that globally good for the ecosystem as a whole but come at notable cost or risk for the school with boots on the ground _following_ that path.  In this unique situation, Edu Corp has several powerful incentive types it can combine to allow schools to remain the final decider of their own fate, while also shaping the tendencies over all schools towards these more challenging paths.


## THE EDU CORP MODEL

… This section is yet to be written …

 

Franchise Model – Each school is a fully independent, for profit, corporation that is owned by the senior cohort.

- Ensures assets are well managed – with very clear ownership.

- Ensures precise & correct control – those taking the financial risk have total control over the assets and decision making around those assets.

- They can “fire” underclass students, they can liquidate the company, they can get additional loans to expand the output of the school.  Whatever make business sense.

### Nth Generational Schools

The **_standard formation_** for a vocational school has one senior cohort, two junior cohorts, and two Freshman cohorts.  Third and later generational schools cycle through four phases that being and end in this standard formation:

1. The Training Phase – During this phase each of the four lower cohorts are busy learning the skills of the business from their upper classmen, from reading, and digital materials.

2. The Negotiation Phase – During negotiations the junior cohorts chooses the future commitments of the school (which they will soon purchase) as well as many details about how the new business and old school will be split.  This phase ends on “graduation day” when all contracts are signed in a single “closing” event.

3. The Construction Phase – Once funds have been signed-for construction for the new business can begin.  This process can stretch out and have various delays based on the nature of the unfolding business.  This phase can overlap subsequent phases as required.

4. The Recruiting Phase – During this final phase the newly formed school with one junior cohort and two Freshman cohorts will recruit two new under class cohorts.  Once this process completes then the junior cohort becomes the senior cohort, the two Freshmen cohorts become the junior cohorts, and the incoming cohorts become the new Freshman cohorts.  This returns the school back to its standard formation and a new cycle of training can begin.

 


## GRADUATION-DAY LOAN AND CONTRACT SIGNING

OUT OF PLACE.  
Using contracts and culture Edu Corp ensures good outcomes across many futures with bottom-up emergent decision making. Clearly Edu Corp contracts have some big shoes to fill, achieve this will be HARD!  But recall, these are first time entrepreneurs, not investment banker corporate structuring experts, so how are they ever going to correctly create and execute these contracts?!

The Edu Corp nonprofit simplifies contracting, by reusing the same basic, repeated corporate restructuring contracts as schools split off into new corporations.  This allows Edu Corp to maintain a set of templated contract documents as well as a detailed recipe for the negotiation steps to support each school in its journey.  Additionally, Edu Corp provides mentoring/arbitrating services to help keep discussions productive and constructive.  Nonetheless, these are _real_ businesses bought with _real_ contractual commitments by the students; it will be critical that students are informed about risks and accept those risks of their own accord.  Edu Corp merely serves a coach, midwife, and councilor in this process, never as its director.

On graduation day a large number of individual contracts are signed in a single atomic step, very much like the way house buying is done on closing day.  The negation of those contracts happens over the previous weeks and month using the following three sequential steps:

1.     _SCHOOL PRICING_ – The senior cohort is selling the whole school over to the two junior cohorts, in this step a price is set for this transfer.

2.     _BILLET BIDDING_ – The junior cohorts negotiate against other schools to decide which schools are going to accept different future paths (with differing difficulties).

3.     _BUSINESS PLANNING_ – The senior and junior cohorts together build a business plan for the new business; this will be detailed enough to support the underwriting of the graduation-day loans required to build this business.

4.     _JUNIOR SPLITTING_ – The junior cohorts finally negotiate how tangible and intangible assets will be split between school and child corporation.

**1. SCHOOL PRICING** – Using a standard depreciation formula the initial price for the school is set using the purchase price of the school as a baseline.  The senior cohort and junior cohorts can argue this price should be adjusted up or down based on changes in the status of the school.  If the tractor has broken down, that would lower its total value, if it now has a larger repeatable customer base that would increase its value.  With arbitration support from the non-profit hopefully a mutually agreeable adjustment can be found.  If not, this is handled as a progression failure as discussed in that section below.

**2. BILLET BIDDING** – Once school pricing is complete at each school junior cohorts bidding against other schools for the progression billet of their choice.  These juniors will be the ones buying the school and executing the mandate indicated by the billet, so they should be the ones to set the price the school is willing to bid to get the billet it wants.  Billet selection executed as an n-round counterweight negotiation as discussed below.

**3. BUSINESS PLANNING** – Once the school has selected a billet it then begins to build its plan for implementation.  These plans need to be detailed enough to support the underwriting of the required capital loan for both the school (if needed) and the new corporation as well.  Both the range of amounts required as well as documentation needed to ensure sufficient value for underwriting are required at this step.

**4. JUNIOR SPLITTING** – With these first two negotiations complete the _two_ junior cohorts then negotiate with themselves regarding how the tangible and intangible assets of the school should be split upon graduation.  Every split will be unique since there can be good reasons to give to tangible and intangible assets to each child entity.  Crucially during the negotiation neither cohort knows if they will be the ones staying with the school or staying with the corporation.  Thus, all are motivated to produce the most effective split possible for both halves. 

## COUNTERWEIGHTING

Counterweight bidding is a process used to balance asymmetric options available to the participants in the billet bidding and junior splitting steps above.  It ensures that all participants are fairly compensated for advantages/disadvantages in selection they receive.

> **_Counterweight bidding_** begins with a price increment, $inc$, a set of $n$ “participants” and $s$ “selections” where $s \geq n$ and finds prices $p_1, ..., p_s$ for each selection such that there are no two participants that want the same selection given those prices.
> 
> Counterweight bidding process proceeds as a sequence of rounds where each participant indicates a selection and a new price, they are willing to pay for that selection.  Their new price must be a positive value which is at least $inc$ larger than any price they have previously bid for that selection.
> 
> Bidding stops when all participants have made distinct selections.  Final pricing for each selection is set to be the second highest bid for that item or is set to zero if only one participant has ever selected that item.
> 
> This bidding encourages participants to immediately bid the maximum amount they would pay for their desired selection, since they will only end up paying just enough to rise above the leading counteroffer.  If their desired selection becomes too expensive, they can switch to another selection.  Because prices are only increasing, eventually the process is guaranteed to terminate with a set of selection prices where each participant prefers a distinct selection.
> 
> **_Neutral pricing_** is achieved by subtracting $P/n$ from all prices where $P$ is the sum of $p_1, ..., p_n$.
> 
> Neutral prices causes some prices to become negative so that the sum of all prices is 0.  In this way prices become a balanced $n$-way cash flow between participants that serve as a “counterweighting” against advantages/disadvantages inherent in the distinct selections they are making.

Counterweight negotiations are performed at the end of both billet bidding and junior splitting to ensure outcomes are fair, everyone is happy with their personal outcome, and that negotiations themselves can be executed with a win-win spirit rather than a zero-sum competitive one.  In billet bidding the negotiation participants are the schools themselves and the selections are the open billets published by Edu Corp.  In junior splitting there are just two participants, the two different junior cohorts, and the two selections are to either remain in the school or join the new sub-corporation.

	NO LONGER NEEDED?  
	In both cases the negotiations proceed as an iterative bidding where each participant chooses a selection and a price that they are willing to pay for their selection.  If two or more participants make the same selection, then the price of that selection is set to be the second highest bid received, and the process repeats where each participant is free to increase their bid for any selection they want.  Eventually this process will bid highly desired selections up to the point where one and only one participant is willing to pay that price.  At this point the process stops with all participants having received their desired selection at a price they were willing to pay.

Payments are intended to be zero sum, thus the sum of all payments are divided by n and then subtracted from each participant’s payment.  This means some participants will be making negative payment, e. g. will be PAID for accepted their choice.  And all payments add to zero, so the system is balanced.

Of course, these are participants are disadvantaged students, they in many cases don’t have any money to pay for anything!  So, when we say “counterweight payments” here, we are referring to agreed-upon future payments made monthly based on future revenue from their future corporation.  The contractually these payments are structured as loans between corporations, with terms carefully constructed so payment is only due when making such payments will not cause the payer’s business to fail.  Thus, the receiver is assuming some risk in accepting these payments, but allowing this minimizes overall corporate failure rates, and will simply be priced into the required payment amounts.  (See cash flow considerations for discussion of the mechanics here.)

Crucially during billet negotiation and junior splitting all participants know there will be a final counterweighting.  This keeps negotiations friendly and win-win.  Each participant may secretly have their favored future selection; this could tempt them to negotiate to heap many advantages upon their secretly favored selection.  But doing this will inevitably ratchet up the counterweight payments they will eventually be forced to pay to _get_ that selection.  Thus, it makes sense to give ground as often as one can and still be happy with the outcome.  This will minimize one’s final counterweight payments since it ensures other participants are _also_ happy with their choices too.  Knowing up front that final selections will be counterweighted can make complex negotiations much more win-win!

## BILLET PLANNING & NEGOTIATION

We said a central tenant of the Edu Corp model is bottom-up decision making, yet right at the center of the whole model is this _centralized_ Edu Corp entity that is publishing a single _centralized_ list of billets that prescriptively dictate action for all schools.  THAT doesn’t sound very _decentralized_!

The way this process is executed is much more decentralized than it sounds at first.  Edu Corp (and sometimes the schools themselves) are performing research into novel geographies, novel customer bases, and novel new businesses, which might be created.  This information is published in a regular forum attended by all existing schools.  Schools are very motivated to have forward looking billets that they will be comfortable signing up for—since they will be required to sign up for one of them when they graduate.  Remember, the schools themselves are for-profit entities that are owned by entrepreneurs hoping to make profit both from their school as well as from the future value of the school itself.  Having good billets makes for good profits.  So, it’s in their collective interest to accurately inform Edu Corp of any knowledge they have regarding outcomes for new businesses within their industries.  If huge profits are to be had selling soybeans, tell Edu Corp so it can create a billet for growing them!  This is a double-edged sword since your school will then need to compete to win that billet.  Still, overall, it is better to have many profitable billets out there (especially ones where you will be differentially in a better position to execute them) than to have unprofitable billets out there.  The counterweight bidding will ensure that you will benefit from profits that are likely to flow to other corporations since they will be willing to bid higher for their billet.

In this way the exact makeup and requirements of then all billets can be shaped towards higher more robust profits _overall._  Notice the collective win-win nature of this information sharing if a school provides information that improves understanding and profits of ten different billets it will profit from ALL TEN, since the required counterweight payments from all of these will flow proportionally back to them.

This mechanism is not a panacea, schools may well keep small local opportunities to themselves, opting to allow their next corporation to reap those benefits alone.  And schools will be incentivized “whine” a lot about the deleterious effects of competition from new future competing corporations that will be serving their same customer base.  Edu Corp will listen attentively, but also discerningly.  Its mandate is to avoid corporate failures, it knows by its very nature Edu Corps can quickly pump out too many corporations that saturate and destroy a viable business ecosystem, so it needs to be on hair trigger alert to stop producing before that point.  The many businesses in that sector are quite motivated (and informed) to help with this!

Part of what makes the information more open and win-win during the planning period is the knowledge that counterweight negotiations will occur at the end of this period.  Tricking Edu Corp into mis framing a billet will only be helpful if they can ensure that no other school also understands this mis framing.  If they do, they will bid to get it themselves.

### BILLET BIDDING

Getting all ducks in a row needed to simultaneously sign all graduation day documents for complex corporation creation will be a feat of corporate restructuring finance.  Trying to coordinate this across multiple schools simultaneously would be entirely unworkable!  Not to mention that not all schools will progress at the same rate.  So exactly how does this billet negotiation process work?

Edu Corp continuously maintains a sets of open billets for future school operations for each type of existing school.  It must develop at least as many billets for each school type as there are schools of that type. 

On a regular cadence of something like every three months, six months or a year, all schools of the same type are invited to bid on these open billets.  Bidding continues in rounds until no billet is selected by more than one school.

If Edu Corp has created a surplus of billets for one type of school, then by default Edu Corp has no preference as to which subset of billets are selected by the schools.  Alternatively, it is possible that Edu Corp does have a preference towards or away from certain billets.  For example, in the case of a new business type or distant geography might open doors for whole new trees of corporation growth if the new models are proven to be profitable.  In that case it might have a strong preference towards such a billet. 

### BILLET BIASING

Edu Corp can express this desire using an incentive called a “forward billet bias.”  A **_forward billet bias_** is an extra loan amount published along with the billet itself which will flow towards or away from the school/corporation that selects this billet.  Billet biasing is cash neutral, so for example a school selects a billet with a positive $12,000 billet bias then and there are six total companies bidding in this round, then each of the bidding companies will effectively have a $12K / 5 or $2.4K loan which they much pay back to the school that selects the positively biased billet.  If no school selects the billet, then each of them will STILL be effectively taking out a loan of $12K / 6 = $2K loan that will be paid into the forward fund.  Later perhaps in the next bidding cycle a second billet bias might put on the same billet… maybe a second $6K bias.  Then the company selecting the billet would be paid the original $12K bias, plus a second $6K coming from the schools in the next batch.

Using such biasing Edu Corp can leverage modest payments from a number of schools in order to fund a truly risky super jump made by some daring school that is greedily eyeing this ever-growing billet bias. 

Negative or ***reverse billet biasing*** is also possible.  For example, if a geography is slowing becoming saturated, Edu Corp might start introducing a headwind against further creation of business within that geography rather than cold turkey removing all billets within that geography.  This ‘headwind’ might be a $30K negative billet bias to be paid into the forward fund. 

Given Edu Corps mission of maximizing successful businesses it should not introduce forward or reverse biases in most cases.  Simply allow schools to  select the path they see as most viable for them.  Only in cases where there is a clear and significant tragedy of the commons, or a clear global good, should it intervene with explicit billet biasing.  Nonetheless the mechanism is there when it is needed.

REWRITE OR DELETE  
Edu Corp does not want some school to way “sure we will try it,”  but then drop the ball at the first hurdle they face.  At the same time they also don’t what the school to go down in flames if they ultimately cannot successfully train their junior class to be able to get building construction business.  Thus Edu Corp sets a very high but not punitive forward loan amount for the construction of this new school.

It is a one _SCARY_ billet.  Everyone bids significant money to escape this one!  But over time all other billet prices steadily rise until this remaining billet has an enormous counterweight payment that will flow from ALL other schools.  It is not so much counterweight that it fully erases the costs of a forward loan failure, but it takes a significant dent out of those payments……   and imagine if your school is the one that succeeds!  Then you will not have to pay any forward loan failure at all, AND you will be getting those fat monthly checks from all the other corporations that did not choose this path less travelled.  Eventually one school can’t resist the opportunity, it bites the bullet with eyes wide open to all the risks.  Win-win-win!


## FORWARD LOANS

Each entrepreneur joining Edu Corp is gaining the chance to build and own a life-changing business based on the many resources given to them by the Edu Corp system,  thus each “owes” a debt to this system, a moral responsibility to “pay it forward” so others may enjoy the same benefit.  The primary way this “forward” payment is made is by co-signing loans and training others to build a thriving business just like ones own.  Still, even with the best of intentions things may not always work out that way.  Personal life circumstances or business-environmental realities may legitimately impede one’s ability to complete ones “forward” duties.  In this case we don’t seek to punish failure, rather we seek to ensure this entrepreneur  is “paying it forward” appropriately in another way.  Like counterweight payments these forward failure payments are structured as loans which are paid from future earnings in ways that don’t threaten the survival of their business but are “garnished” from those future revenues in a way they cannot easily escape.  (See cash flow considerations for details.)

Forward loans are typically broken into three components for each of the three commitments being made during progression.  Typically, these commitments are to:

1.  **CO-SIGN** the loans for four underclassman and one person within one’s own cohort.

2.  **SELL SCHOOL** to your junior class, and

3.  **CREATE SUB-CORPORATION** that becomes and remains cash-flow positive for some defined period of time.

Each of these parts is associated with a very precise contractual definition of “failure” to execute that part of the pay it forward responsibility, and the specific loan amount associated with these failures.  When forward failures occur the loan proceeds are paid into a special “forward fund” that is maintained by the Edu Corp non-profit.  (See forward fund for discussion of its usage.)

Other billet structures are possible, sometimes Edu Corp (in discussion with existing companies) decides to increase the total number of schools by encouraging one to split into two schools to increase the rate at which corporations are produced.  Alternatively, it might encourage the termination of schools of a certain type, by offering a billet that has no requirement for a sub-corporation.  Selecting these different billets with different expected futures will come with different Forward loan contractual terms since they will have different expected progression outcomes.

In all cases the forward loans contractually formalize the ideal progression pathway for each selected billet and formally encode the global costs of failing to complete each part of that path. 



## THE FORWARD FUND

The forward fund is the way entrepreneurs “pay it forward” by other means.  It receives funds from three sources:

1. Forward loan failures are paid over time into the general forward fund.

2. Edu Corp may additionally uniformly “tax” all progression billets over time as a way of building excess funds if certain future billets will require significant seed funding for branching into new risky business areas.
   
3. Philanthropic organizations with missions related to Edu Corp goals may opt to provide funds to Edu Corp (usually with strings attached).  These funds are placed into the forward fund but remain segregated so that Edu Corp can be sure to honor the requirements placed on the spending of those funds.

The primary way future funds are used, is in driving the overall growth in the Edu Corp ecosystem.  Normal school progression is performed using the revenues generated by the school itself.  But in exceptional cases excess risk, or significant up front seed money may be required to even make the attempt on these new businesses.  In these cases, seed money built up over time in the forward fund it used.

The Edu Corp mission is to maximize the number of successful businesses and entrepreneurs while also minimizing the number of failures it produces.  Thus, is it may opt to uniformly tax all billets to gather funds for more rapid expansion, but not up to the point of harming those future businesses.  In all its actions Edu Corp seeks to balance these two objectives as best it can.



## CASH FLOW CONSIDERATIONS

            ``There’s many a slip a ‘twixt the cup and the lip’’

Edu Corp schools and companies are often formed from first time entrepreneurs, potentially with little or no prior business background, and whose members may not have even know each other for that long prior to signing large multi-year loan contracts.  And their corporate assets are worth many times any salary they have ever seen in their life, and their accounts receivable revenue streams are larger than any they have ever had access to before.

What could possibly go wrong???      Answer:  A LOT!!

Of course, there is no way to fully protect members from the many forms of malfeasance that such a system might enable, still there are a set of simple, well understood controls that Edu Corp use which can great help protect its own interests in having its contracts honored, as well as the interests of each participant that are hoping their own corporation is operated honestly and fairly for all its members.

All schools and corporations begin their existence in a kind of ‘receivership’ to the Edu Corp nonprofit.  All their assets and loan obligations are owned by the for-profit entity, but they are managed by Edu Corp accounting.

This process is streamlined and largely automated.  All accounts receivable flow into accounts controlled by Edu Corp, and loan documents, asset deeds, etc. are maintained by Edu Corp on behalf of each corporation. 

Further, the status of and computed payments for graduation loans, forward loans, and counter payment loans are maintained centrally by Edu Corp.  Then certain classes of accounts payable can be made directly prior to paying these many loan cash flows out.  Finally profits and other discretionary spending can be taken out after that.

Generally governmental tax obligations as well as payments required for corporate continuation are taken out before loan payments, then loan payments, followed by discretionary payments.

This often means that employee salaries are paid in two parts, the first small bit of money is just enough to keep them able to eat and continue the business in a very basic fashion.  Only after all loan obligations are covered is the corporation able to further pay its employees.  This structure maximizes the value that these loan guarantees have for their recipients, without unduly risking the survival of the corporation itself.

Getting this balancing act correct is important for the _profits_ of the corporation itself.  This counter intuitive point is important to understand.  On graduation day, each participant will be required to sign counterweight loans, forward loans, and graduate day loans too.  The ultimate value they will get from those loans will be directly connected to the chances that their recipient will ultimately receive their payments. If we make it too easy for an ultimately successful individual to get out of pay their loans back, the recipient counter parties will have to apply ever greater discounts to the face value of these loans when valuing them.  Each participant wants the perceive value to be nearly 100% so they don’t need to overpay on graduation day.  But this requires Edu Corp being stringent on repayment terms.  But not so stringent that they cause corporations to fail (or lives of the entrepreneurs  to be too miserable).  The correct payment structure will be a nuanced ordering of priorities that balances these concerns.

But once businesses have discharged their obligations for a given period their funds are theirs to use as they see fit.  They will likely have rules regarding employee voting and such when major transactions are being considered.  A nice benefit of having the corporation in this stylized receivership position is that such oversight validation can be easily and reliable done for benefit of the corporation.  This virtually eliminates the very real risks new corporations face that somehow one of the employees manage to drain huge funds, then quickly flying to the Bahamas for early retirement never to be seen again.

Once a corporation has discharged all its Edu Corp contractual obligations it is free to leave receivership with Edu Corp, or for a fee, it might choose to continue to retain the added layer of accounting protection afforded by the arrangement.  But either way, at that point, all restrictions are removed from how it might utilize its monies.
