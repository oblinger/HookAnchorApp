## COMBINED MATH

$200,000 USD = Total  setup costs (Greenhouse + initial land lease for 4 years + well for water)
$57,961/yr  =  $165K paid over 4 years at 6% interest

$58 /Year /m^2  = Loan payments required
577 GHC / Year /m^2   (Target annual revenue per square meter for a 4 year payback)

12-50 Kg/m^2 = Annual tomato yield per square meter   (50Kg yield per m^2 is quite aggressive )

13 GHC/kg = Whole sale tomato price surge found in 2020 = 933GHC / 72kg 
==> 156-650 GHC /year /m^2

8 GHC / m^2 = Average wholesale price in 2022
==>  96-400GHC /year /m^2
