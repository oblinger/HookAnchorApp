### r2022-06-10  Master thesis, Code Mirror 6 editor that edits in two different languages at once

What a coincidence. My master thesis "Projectional Editing of Internal Domain-Specific Languages" relies on CodeMirror 6 for its implementation, and I just happen to have handed in my thesis today, on the same day CodeMirror 6 is released. :)

If anyone is interested in the topic, the implementation is on Github: [https://github.com/niklaskorz/puredit](https://github.com/niklaskorz/puredit)

Also, here's a demo: [https://thesis.korz.tech/](https://thesis.korz.tech/)
