### --- Ben Wild Compensation ---

-- Normally a hands-off introduction is 4% of the gross revenue of the first 12 months of contract work.
-- In the case of this “city towing” idea, it is pushing us in new strategic directions that seem interesting
In this specific case makes sense to double that to 8% of the first 12 months, 
BUT if we are going to be doing a lot of internal, unpaid R&D then we only want to start paying out money once we have broken even on the internal work we did (we will count using any and all sources of city towing money towards this break even point.  We would keep the amount we owed you on paper until the break even point, and then start paying you as revenue came in.)

Not written to him, but if he talks about equity:
If you are owning some part of a joint business then it would make sense to share equity around that business.  Still as you know, really driving a new business take sweat, so we would want to be in a position where you are ready to throw down some agreed upon, significant chunk of time.
### --- ChipStack ---

REFERRAL FEE -- Some kind of referral fee payment for any business that Shane brings to AF.

SHARED EQUITY -- Some kind of equity sharing for the system built.
(specifically, the ability for either he or AF to “go our separate way” and build from the IP that had been produced.  At least for some period of time.)

KEEP-THE-LIGHTS-ON-SALARY -- Something like 20K/year.
