Jason, 
Generally US labor law generally recognizes location of where as the governing law.  In 2016 California explicitly eliminated possibility of using contract jurisdiction at a means of avoiding California CIIA rules.
So its fine to use that CIIA, but it is not valid for a California resident without modification.  A common strategy is to adopt an Orrick-style CIIA (as used by default when Clerky.com sets up a new company) this CIIA explicitly retains strong IP guarantees while also accommodating laws in relevant states.

As is this contract creates ambiguity.  This is a stick point for those we hire (like me), and also for our investors, as they would need to use a partially invalid contact as the basis of any IP fight.





## Issues
- Post A salary of $300K
- IP restrictions
- 
- Max shares on the SIP


- cannot get cap gains on the sale, unless you sell before 1 year
	- QSBS works well when reinvesting it.
	  (holding period required.  option is not )
	- Congress QSBS has already been looking hard 

- will pay ordinary income on shares


- 409A - valuation
- Exercise the option.


2.4 Keep the company informed:  Do I just give them a running log of all inventions that I conceive.  Even ones that have nothing to do with the business?
   can we limit this to inventions that relate to the business.


Company cannot force you to assign.  22.42
- Own time
- Relates to the companies business
- Arises out of the work for you company
- Don't use their resources.

Approach
- Disclose some things - 
- Seperate laptops - 
- Create evidentiary record - 

=================
CIIA 2.1 (d) “**_Company Inventions_**” means any and all Inventions (and all Intellectual Property Rights related to Inventions) that are made, conceived, developed, prepared, produced, authored, edited, amended, reduced to practice, or learned or set out in any tangible medium of expression or otherwise created, in whole or in part, by me, either alone or with others, during my employment by Company, and all printed, physical, and electronic copies, and other tangible embodiments of Inventions.


**==> If I understand this... it is TERRIBLE.  If I came up with a catchy tune, they would own it!  If so I am trying to think of ways to amend this that would be acceptable to investors in their upcoming A-round.  Here are some ideas:**



IDEA 1
   "Company Inventions described above shall be limited to any invention relating to Sports, Computer Vision, or any IP produced in the course of work at Sports Visio"
   
I also tell Jason the CEO that I will sign a new CIIA if the company pivots so far this does not cover the company.  I believe this will satisfy Jason since I think he is confident in the direction of the company within such a broad scope.  Further any investor will also understand this scope is broad enough to over any version of the current company.

Still, in diligence investors might worry about a pivot where the company moves in a new direction, based upon early research from their CTO, who then refuses to sign a new CIIA.  They can fire me, but in theory I could still claim ownership over my personal research into this new direction while on the company dime.

I tried to cover this last case by saying even work outside those areas, if undertaken as part of my duties at SV would still be owned by them.  This would leave them with the burden of showing that I in fact did the work in course of duties at SV, but that seems pretty easy assuming it is work that is being discussed and requested by SV.

I am ready to go the mat over this issue with Jason, still I cannot request something that will be major heart burn at a funding event.

What is your thought?


IDEA 2
   "Company Inventions described above shall be limited to any invention relating to Sports, or Computer Vision or any new area of company interest as expressed in written form by a company officer."


Even if I allow for the company to retroactively declare a new interest in bounds, that could still offer some pragmatic coverage for me:

It would be incredible evil to let me start a new company that becomes successful, then 2 years later express an interest in the area, and try to claim ownernship over the early IP I produced before leaving SV.  I dont think Jason would do this, it would really require pressure from other investors or such.  At a pragmatic level even this language would add value for me, if investors would accept it.

Ideally I would have language that says "new interest" can only apply retroactively to IP generated within the last year.  this should cover Sports Visio, but it is also getting complex.



IDEA 3
Failing the two ideas above, I could just create a stream of documents to the company where I declare various things I am doing and ask in each case for an exemption.  as allowed by the existing agreement as shown below.  Jason would grant these, but it is not cool to have to do this all the time!  And I wonder if such a multi-item list itself would cause concern for investors:

e. g.  so are any of these an issue for the company, each would need to be considered, and also what the heck is our CTO doing?!

or maybe such items could be framed as an ongoing list of "outside interests of the CTO" in a way that was either not seen, or just looked like something to be glanced at to ensure nothing looked close to the corp mission (which they would not)

maybe that would be low risk/complexity??


CIIA 2.4    **Obligation to Keep Company Informed**.  During my employment by Company, I will promptly and fully disclose to Company in writing all Inventions that I author, conceive, or reduce to practice, either alone or jointly with others.  At the time of each disclosure, I will advise Company in writing of any Inventions that I believe constitute Nonassignable Inventions; and I will at that time provide to Company in writing all evidence necessary to substantiate my belief. Subject to Section 2.3(b), Company agrees to keep in confidence, not use for any purpose, and not disclose to third parties without my consent, any confidential information relating to Nonassignable Inventions that I disclose in writing to Company.



Big picture, what do you see done in cases like this that balances employee freedom and corporate control?



==================
SIP   3.1       Reserved Shares.   Subject to the adjustments provided in Article 8.0, the maximum number of the Company’s Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), for which Awards may be granted under this Plan shall be four hundred ninety six thousand, six hundred sixty seven (496,667) shares of Common Stock (the “Authorized Plan Shares”), unless the Board and the requisite shareholders of the Company increase or decrease (but not less than the number of shares issued or issuable pursuant to Awards that have not expired or been terminated, surrendered or canceled) the same.

**==> Do we need board approval to apply the SIP to my 1M shares?**



==================
SIP 3.2       Termination, Surrender, or Cancellation of Awards.   If any Award expires or is terminated, surrendered, or canceled without having been fully exercised, is forfeited in whole or in part, or otherwise results in any Authorized Plan Shares not being issued, then the unissued Authorized Plan Shares covered by such Award shall again be available for the grant of Awards under this Plan.  If any Authorized Plan Shares issued pursuant to an Award granted under this Plan are repurchased by, or are surrendered or forfeited to, the Company at no more than cost, then such Authorized Plan Shares shall again be available for the grant of Awards under this Plan, subject, however, in the case of Incentive Stock Options (as defined in Section 5.2), to any limitations under the Code.  Authorized Plan Shares issued under this Plan may consist in whole or in part of authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.

**==> What do I need to do with share if I leave/terminated either before/after vesting is complete?  Are all shares vested shares protected here?  In all cases can I just exercise them at the first liquidity event?**

**==>  qualified Incentive Stock Option.   what is this?  are mine qualified?**



======================
**TERMINATION** 
SIP 5.5       Effect of Termination.   No Incentive Stock Option may be exercised unless, at the time of such exercise, the Participant is, and has continuously since the date of grant of his or her Incentive Stock Option been, employed by the Company, except that, unless the Option Agreement expressly provides otherwise:

(a)        the Incentive Stock Option may be exercised within the period of ninety (90) days after the date the Participant’s employment with the Company terminates other than for death, disability or Cause;

**==> So if I quit or are terminated do I loose my vested options?**

PAYMENT 
5.7       Payment Upon Exercise.   Payment for shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of an Option granted under this Plan shall be made by one or any combination of the following forms of payment:

(b)       to the extent permitted by the Board, in its sole discretion, by (i) delivery of a promissory note of the Participant to the Company on terms determined by the Board, or (ii) payment of such other lawful consideration as the Board may determine;

==> Right now, if I fully vested, and moved on after five years I would need 
		to cough up a million bucks in order to keep my shares!

If so, I will ask Jason, Let's just agree I can pay for shares @ time of liquidity event.  



========================
**TERMINATION FOR CAUSE**
SIP 5.5 (d)       if the Participant’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company for Cause (as defined in Section 9.5(b) below), the Incentive Stock Option shall terminate immediately;


SIP 9.5 (c)        The Board shall make all determinations regarding whether a Participant’s conduct constitutes Cause, and the Board’s determination as to whether particular ***conduct of a Participant constitutes Cause shall be final*** and binding upon such Participant.  In making any such determination, the Board shall act in good faith.

==> So the board can say I was terminated for cause, I loose all share and have no recourse?



========================
TAX CONSEQUENCES

Dave, I know that tax consequences are well outside your area of expertise.  Thus I am simply asking as one who as need a few of these document, if the claim made below by Jason seems untrue in some way according to whatever you have picked up along the way:

Feel free to confirm with the lawyer but my understanding is that there is NO tax consequence to options, that's the advantage of structuring it this way. You get to keep all the cash and get the gains still.
