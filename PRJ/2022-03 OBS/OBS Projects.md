### PRJ - Projects
PRJ - Larger efforts.
- SHORT NAME -- Used as a prefix for todo items and for the folder name.


### ROCKS
ROCK -- A large-ish time bounded effort.    [[PRJ]] 
- NAME -- Each rock has a shortname shows as: NNNN.  If this project will have todo items the name should be abbreviated to under 10 chars
- FOLDER -- Each has a dedicated dated folder ROCKS/YYYY-MM NNNN
- HEAD -- Each rock has a head file whose name is:   ROCKS/YYYY-MM NNNN/YYYY-MM NNNN
- PRJ -- Optionally a Rock may have a project folder:  PRJ/NNNN  with a project head:   PRJ/NNNN/NNNN


A rock is a time-bounded effort where the active portion of its life is between a week and a year in length

- LINKED - Each must be linked from the [[PRJ]] hook page.
- DATED PAGE - Each must have a  "pYYYY-MM NNNN"  hook page (which often links to a short)          <--- give this a prefix!



THINKING

- Maybe ALL prj:
	- Have a folder:   ~/ob/kmr/P/pYYYY-MM NNNN
	- A dated landing page:  ~/ob/kmr/P/pYYYY-MM NNNN/pYYYY-MM NNNN.md
	- And an entry in the P.md file with an explanation text
	- OPTIONALLY have
		- A shortname landing page in the same sub-folder, linked with the dated page (which is usually just a reference back to the short landing page)
		- Then further optionally as a simlink to a short name folder (In the prj folder) and 



- ??? Even when a project only has a dated entry Obsidian quick switcher will find it by just typing the name since it is exactly contained in the name after the date (but they are always listed AFTER non-dated entries)
- Later when deleting the sim-links the dated entry still lives on without any path change, so no broken pathnames
