### CAPS ENTRY

An ***all caps*** entry is a "hook of hooks", within the unified namespace it serves as a prefix for many other hooks thus becoming a menu of other hooks.

- For smaller menus we try to arrange each sub-menu item to have a unique starting letter, this allows one to navigate BOTH menu levels in an open loop fashion.

- In some sense, any hook with multiple named facets in already a name space menu, but we don't use all caps for hooks whose sub entries are mostly the universal hook facets (like folder, doc and website).  Instead ALL CAPS is reserved for hooks that have subhooks that themselves might have facets, there by being a full two-level menu.
