# Proposed collaboration model


APPROACH --
- LIGHT -- Just trying this out.  easy on both sides.  learning on both sides.
- EARLY GIVE -- We double our lead gen rates during this learning phase.


- PRESENTATION -- Dan present's himself as 'part' of AF, as an Advisor, with an AF email address etc.
	- ADVISOR -- Assuming that we manage to create a thriving sales channel with Dan, we have him as an advisor for a year, and reevaluate where we are at the end of that period.
	- EMAIL -- All of his emails on behalf of AF are sent using this email address and visible to us.  (Indeed we collaborate as a team on making them as effective as possible)
	- CALLS/CONTACTS -- In some way that is efficient for Dan he keeps a log of calls/contacts on behalf of AF so we can coordinate all of our outreach.


REV SHARE RATE MODEL
				
				Preferred	Other
	FULL SALES	12%			6%
	LEAD GEN	4%			2%
	Q1/Q2		8%			4%


REV SHARE
- FULL SALES RATE -- Rate paid for a sales exec that owns 100% of sale closing.
- PREFERRED CLIENT RATE -- A client that meets our current "ideal customer model"


DETAILS ABOUT REV SHARE
- Percent of all topline revenue connected with the first 12 months of contract execution.  
- this excludes any planning phase if it is less than 2/3rds full pay, and include pay for hours worked in those 12 months even if payment not recieved during those month.  
- Payment is contingent on AF receipt of funds
- Payment is due 30 days after AF is paid.

### 2019.10 - Nick's Thoughts About An Agreement

Also, last note:

No websites
No marketing tech companies
No services companies
No compromise on pod model
No negotiating rates for us (instead let us give proposal)

my main thoughts:

strategic sectors:
energy & utilities
automotive
transportation, logistics, & maritime
smart city, smart building, smart sensors
strategic work:
AI
IoT
Safety critical
mission oriented (eg clean energy, clean water, etc)
very large scale
for strategic accounts (in strategic sector || strategic work) I think we would pay up to the following...
F2K: 10% first year top line
Sub F2K: 5% first year top line
...for :
high density lead intros RIGHT NOW (but not long term). 100% commission. Strategic only.
Full cycle sales (get to PDD with high density closing). 100% commission. Strategic only.
We want to pay less for non-strategic in general & also pay less for non-full cycle lead intros long term. However, I think those numbers probably have more to do with negotiating leverage & what he will say yes to

I like the idea of starting with 8/4 as our ceiling from the beginning instead of 10/5 to create negotiation room, & proposing lower numbers from the rest based on your read of what he would accept

thoughts?
