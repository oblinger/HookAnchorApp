A Dan Project (DP) is the way I manage my coding projects.  Local dan projects
- Have a project folder with a unique filename that serves as the project name. 
  (Often these are under ~/ob/proj or ~/ob/kmr/Prj/binproj).
- Have a project markdown file with the same name as the folder:  XXX/XXX.md
- May have a GitHub-linked git repo in the root folder with the same name as the project.
- May have a .claude folder with claude config for the project
- May have a .idea folder with config for pycharm for the project
