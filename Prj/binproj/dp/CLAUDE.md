This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Dan Project (DP) documentation repository that defines a personal project management methodology. The project consists primarily of documentation files describing how "Dan Projects" are structured and organized.

## Project Structure

- `dp.md` - Main documentation file describing the Dan Project methodology
- Projects following this methodology typically have:
  - A project folder with unique filename serving as project name
  - A markdown file with same name as folder (XXX/XXX.md)
  - Optional GitHub-linked git repo
  - Optional .claude folder for Claude configuration
  - Optional .idea folder for PyCharm configuration

## Development Context

This is part of a larger "BinProj" collection of script projects that are linked by a personal bin folder. The parent directory contains other related projects like "Budg" (budget management) and "km" (knowledge management).
