Edmunds
- $6,412 trade; $10,366 Private; $12,655 Dealer.


Car is in very good condition, it has XXX scratches but otherwise in great shape.
It was lightly driven by the original owner (me) until 2010 when I put it in my parents barn for storage.
This year we took it out and did $3000 in repairs, replacing all old rubber etc. in order to get it ready for sale.
Edmonds lists $10,366 as value for private sale, I am putting it on the market for $9,000 just to speed the sale.

Please call my parents at
