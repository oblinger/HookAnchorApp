## THE PLAN

Question: once sale is complete, do we keep the signed title to send to DC, or do we send a photo copy of the title?

SELLING PLAN

- Mom check's DC requirements (or we just take the risk)
- Dan gets the notary to notarize the power of attorney
- Danny mails documents:
	- Notarized power of attorney
	- Bill of sale with dates and details missing
	- The title itself
- Dan lists car on Auto trader and on mom's facebook account in to facebook marketplace with her number as contact on both.
- Once sale is agreed:
	- The seller brings cash or mom's goes to bank to accept cashiers check
	- mom fills in details on bill of sale and on the title and gives the title to the buyer.
	- Mom makes copies of the docs (at a copier or on her phone)
	- Mom sends the Bill of sale (and a copy of the signed title) to me and to DC DMV


PRICE
- Edmonds.com lists the car's value at $10,366 for private sale
- I am thinking to list the car at $9,500
- And if someone negotiates down we go to $9000 on the first day.
- After couple of days we drop to $9000 and allow folks to negotiate down to $8,000
- If we are not getting bites at all we can drop the price after a week or two.

what do you think about that plan?


TEXT ABOUT THE CAR

Selling a 2000 Acura for my out of state son:

The car is in good condition, it has XXX scratches but otherwise in great shape.
He is the original owner; it was lightly driven until 2010 when he put it in our garage for storage.
This year we took it out and did $3000 in repairs, replacing all old rubber etc. in order to get it ready for sale (I have the receipts for you).
Edmonds lists $10,366 as its value for private sale, so I am putting it on the market for $9,000 just to speed its the sale.


## Where to sell

Here are some of the best places to advertise a car for sale by the owner:

1. **Craigslist**  
    Craigslist is a popular platform for selling used cars locally. It allows you to list your car for free or a minimal fee depending on the region. You can include details, photos, and contact information for potential buyers.
    
2. **Facebook Marketplace**  
    Facebook Marketplace is widely used for local sales and offers a huge audience. It’s easy to post your car listing, and you can leverage your social network for additional visibility. Buyers can contact you directly via Messenger, simplifying communication.
    
3. **Autotrader**  
    Autotrader is one of the top platforms dedicated to selling cars. It has a vast audience specifically looking for vehicles, though it requires a listing fee. You can include detailed descriptions, photos, and even run vehicle history reports.
