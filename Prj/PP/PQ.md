### 2024-06-04  Hiring a new Cleaner


We are looking for a through clean of 2 bathrooms and a kitchen. Then (vacuum only) for one area. One worker should be plenty. We are aiming for 3 hours of work. We are flexible about which weekday when the work is done.  I am calling this a "through clean" since we want the bathrooms to be carefully cleaned.  Still right now, those bathrooms are not too bad.

Our Tub faucet started dripping about a week ago, probably just need the rubber seal replaced.  I would like to get a price estimate for just replacing the rubber seal (assuming that is the problem).  As well as the price for replacing the whole faucet with the only from Amazon.  Below is a photo of the current faucet.  New one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TIRHV0I/ref=syn_sd_onsite_desktop_0?ie=UTF8&pd_rd_plhdr=t&aref=n5PPIcTYDi&th=1
