Clay, Kevin, Vicki, Baji, and Jim:
I have FINALLY managed to collect contact info for our extended building (that was harder than the spraying will be!). And everyone is 'down' for try to spray our way out of the ant infestation.  Below I have the product info for the indoor/outdoor spray I intend to use.  I also have an outdoor-specific spray I can use if this one does not work, but lets try this first.

Here below is the product I will use, and the info sheet that goes with it.  Also I have cut/paste the relevant part from that data sheet here too:
• People and Pets may re-enter treated area after spray has dried. 
• Thoroughly wash all food processing surfaces and utensils with soap and water before reuse. 
• Repeat as needed. Re-treatment is recommended at least once per season (3 months) outdoors. 
• For long-lasting residual control leave spray undisturbed. The product will keep on killing for up to 12 months


I will keep my dog out of the back yard for a few hours and that is it.  Let me know if Tuesday evening can work with everyone.  My thought is to aim for about 6:30 or so in order for folks to get home and it is still light out.

Down with the invasion!
Cheers :-)

### 2024-06-06  Bathtub Faucet

- 6 3/4" 
- 

Dan, 
The faucet on our tub is busted and it will cost $2-3K to break tile and fix it.  We have been thinking about renovating that tub into a shower anyway but right now we are loosing about $300/mo in extra water bills, so we need to decide what to do fast.

Our tub is in an area 28" x 58" x 96".  We are thinking to remove the tub and the tile, then replace with floor to ceiling slate with a glass wall door in front.  I know that you mostly do outside work, but I was hoping you would know very ball park numbers for how much such a simple install could be.
Is this 10K, 20K or $30K?  Any idea?  And do you have someone that I could send a photo to, who would give a unofficial estimate.  (our main goal is to first just decide if we should just go a head a spend the $3K to fix the faucet and worry about the renovation later, or do the renovation now.)

Thanks for any pointers!



### 2024-06-04  Hiring a new Cleaner


We are looking for a through clean of 2 bathrooms and a kitchen. Then (vacuum only) for one area. One worker should be plenty. We are aiming for 3 hours of work. We are flexible about which weekday when the work is done.  I am calling this a "through clean" since we want the bathrooms to be carefully cleaned.  Still right now, those bathrooms are not too bad. 



### 2024-05-16  Replace bath faucet

Our Tub faucet started dripping about a week ago, probably just need the rubber seal replaced.  I would like to get a price estimate for just replacing the rubber seal (assuming that is the problem).  As well as the price for replacing the whole faucet with the only from Amazon.  Below is a photo of the current faucet.  New one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TIRHV0I/ref=syn_sd_onsite_desktop_0?ie=UTF8&pd_rd_plhdr=t&aref=n5PPIcTYDi&th=1
