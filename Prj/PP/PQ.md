- Multiple ALL_CAPS prefixes in the spot defs file indicates a "jump" table
- Scan KMR finds definition file (error if multiple found)
- Scan of Jump content indicates old jumps, deleted jumps (with given prefix), and new jumps to add at end.
- Should look for suffixes as well as full entries when looking at content.  So AMA Kindle or just Kindle.

- Figure out why we get repeated entries in the "::" sections of the doc

### 2024-06-06  Faucet

- 6 3/4" 
- 

Dan, 
The faucet on our tub is busted and it will cost $2-3K to break tile and fix it.  We have been thinking about renovating that tub into a shower anyway but right now we are loosing about $300/mo in extra water bills, so we need to decide what to do fast.

Our tub is in an area 28" x 58" x 96".  We are thinking to remove the tub and the tile, then replace with floor to ceiling slate with a glass wall door in front.  I know that you mostly do outside work, but I was hoping you would know very ball park numbers for how much such a simple install could be.
Is this 10K, 20K or $30K?  Any idea?  And do you have someone that I could send a photo to, who would give a unofficial estimate.  (our main goal is to first just decide if we should just go a head a spend the $3K to fix the faucet and worry about the renovation later, or do the renovation now.)

Thanks for any pointers!



### 2024-06-04  Hiring a new Cleaner


We are looking for a through clean of 2 bathrooms and a kitchen. Then (vacuum only) for one area. One worker should be plenty. We are aiming for 3 hours of work. We are flexible about which weekday when the work is done.  I am calling this a "through clean" since we want the bathrooms to be carefully cleaned.  Still right now, those bathrooms are not too bad.

Our Tub faucet started dripping about a week ago, probably just need the rubber seal replaced.  I would like to get a price estimate for just replacing the rubber seal (assuming that is the problem).  As well as the price for replacing the whole faucet with the only from Amazon.  Below is a photo of the current faucet.  New one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TIRHV0I/ref=syn_sd_onsite_desktop_0?ie=UTF8&pd_rd_plhdr=t&aref=n5PPIcTYDi&th=1
