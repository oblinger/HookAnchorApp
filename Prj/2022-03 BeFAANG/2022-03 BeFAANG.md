I think one thing that would be helpful would be to take 20 minute to write down the answer to these questions…

1. Who do you want to be hired by? (What humans, in what org) 
2. Who does that person think they want to hire? (What is the stereotype they are looking for? Words do they use to describe them?)
3. What do they think that the person they are looking for does all day? (Skills, type of experience)
4. What outcomes do they think they are going to get? What words describe those outcomes?
…and then, as a separate follow up activity, try to fit yourself (skills, experience) into to match.


1. HIRED BY:  A FAANG VP/Director with leadership gap in their Data Science/DL/ML project team.
2. THEY WANT:  A hands on, leader, with extensive experienced  building novel solutions that transfer recent AI advances into product.
3. MY DAILY WORK:  Forges business&technical consensus around solution approach, then leads his team's tactical & strategic execution of the approach.
4. DESIRED OUTCOMES: 
	- TEAM GROWN - Often such teams must first be hired internally or externally.  Then
	- CORP CONSENSUS BUILT - Technically, Strategically, and Politically strong solutions planned ...
	- STRONG/TIMELY PROJECT COMPLETION -   ... and aggressively executed.
	- TEAM MANAGED AND MENTORED - ... by an engaged, happy, and progressing team of individuals.
