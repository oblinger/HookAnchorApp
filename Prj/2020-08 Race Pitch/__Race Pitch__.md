Mark Granovetter -- distance friends bridge structural hold


Objectives:
- Provide quantitaively driven non-confrontational guidance and thought leadership for portfolio companies in managing their 

Problem:
- Most who participate in diversity training honestly believe that they personally are not part of the problems discussed, thus do not need to make systematic changes in their mindset.
- The current approach of trying to convince employees that they are potentially racist and need to change their ways is confrontational, unneeded, and ultimately counter productive.

Key insights:
	(1) **COMPOUNDING** -- small uncounscious biases systemtatically applied over time have a compounding effect.
	(2) **OLD BOYS CLUB** -- non-racial (essential) biases (like biases towards those you have worked with, or those with relevant skills) can have an unintended secondary effect of making an organization "impenatrable" to new talent and racial diversity)

Solution:
- Use **QUANTITIAVE** models to **VISUALLY** show the cumulative effects of racial and non-racial biases.  (quantiative models will be especially potent within the finance industry where understanding of and believe in quantiative models reigns supreme.)

- **PERFECT FOR FINTECH** -- In this industry in particular we believe their is a much easier/stronger/more productive path toward understanding:


Key Insight:
- **QUANTITATIVE and VISUAL** -- The key is to QUANTITAITVELY, and vicerally show how seemly small, unintended, and often unaware biases when applied systematically and over a lifetime have a magnifying effect that become large over time.  The key attributes of this insight:
	- **INNOCOUS** -- show big effects of small innocous actions
	- **TWEAKABLE** -- ``but I don't believe your assumptions... tiny adjust should fix problem.''
	- **NON-CONFRONTATIONAL** -- No one is saying you should completely ignore the fact that a collegue went to the same school you did.  Still we can quantitatively show attending to even such a small thing can have a significant compounding effect.
	- **AWARENESS over AUTHORITY** -- Focusing on changes in mindset rather enforcement
	- **TIME COMPOUNDING OF SMALL EFFECTIVE** -- These amplifying and accumulating effects are QUANTITAITVELY provided by stocastically modelling outcomes based on actual corporate demographics existing in busiensses today. 
	- **APPEAL TO BETTER ANGELS** -- Armed with this insight, we most employees are well intentioned and will naturally monitor their own behavior to a far greater degree than if they truely believe they are having this effect as opposued to traditional diversity training.


**HOW TO BUILD THE SIMULATION**:
- use exist HR manuals as blueprint for generic ladders for simulation; 
- use stated experience markers as basis for hiring, promotion model
- load existing demographics connecting university affiliations, corporate/title racial profiles, along with prior work experience connections.

==> MODEL IS MORE BELIEVABLE SINCE ACTUAL DATA IS USED
	==> this allows us to show accurate consequences for common "justified" biasing based on "race-neutral" connections (like same school, experience on same kind of project, or with same companies)
	
==> MODEL CAN BE USED TO SHAPE HR AND CORP CHANGES
	We can concretely see the permability consequence of having a mentorship program, or internal junior-internship programs, etc.
