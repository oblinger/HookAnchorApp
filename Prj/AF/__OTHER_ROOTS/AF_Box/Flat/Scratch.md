Karen:

Tonight's conversation was just aweful.  And it was all over the place.  At one time
we are deciding that we are not going to kiss anymore, at first very playfully said,
then later forcefully with anger, then ending saying that I had not choice in the matter
you were definitely going to be kissing me tomorrow.

I don't think it was thought out on your part, and I think it comes from conflicting
ideas, and trying to push things, but not push things too far.  It did not feel good,
and it lowers my respect a little.  But still not so far, not so bad.
I am old enough to know that things don't always line up, a very good catch, can 
have some notable issues going on, and still be a good catch -- still work out well in 
the long run.  We were all over the place, indeed we have been all over the place everytime
this issue can up.... except the the very first moment.

In that first moment, there was raw fear on your face, and there was vulnerablity
in your eyes, and you said, "I don't know if I should push you away"
That felt totally honest, and painfully vulnerable.....  I respect that.


Still like I said, I expect the person I am with will have some baggage....  I expect
that there will be 'homework to do' in getting to a great place -- indeed all of this 
"stuff"  feels like stuff that wont matter so much if we are dating exclusively, so I 
try not to let it affect me too much.


But I am quite bothered by this nontheless -- not about the awefulness of this nite,
but about the where it leaves things:

- I like you.  I like being with you.  I like teasing around with you.  I am super 
  comefortable being with you.
 
 === 13.01.30  --  Quit working at paybygroup???

Currently in a loose-loose situation

LEAVE BECAUSE
-	DON’T LOVE – Don’t love this business – There are other ideas I do love (bit crazier ideas though)
-	AM LAME – Fede is gonna run rings around me.   (should verify this first)
-	œ
-	WRONG PATH – not wise career move to become excellent here.
-	NEED BREAK – burned out, need break.
-	GEOGRAPHY – wrong geography to find mate.
-	LOOSE-LOOSE – if we loose I loose, if we win team fires me
-	EXCITEMENT – just not excited about PBG (4 sure), and am excited about beyond (mirage?)

STAY BECAUSE
-	IRREPLACABLE – I don’t have the dev skills to get another founder job on that basis.  Must be my idea.
(but I guess I don’t want another dev founder position)
-	


CONSIDERATIONS
-	LEVEL – Is this startup of higher quality than what I could do on my own?
-	LONG HAUL – if I don’t want for long haul – then leave now; since wrong path & diming chances
-	OP-COST – six months to home away



SHOULD STAY 
-	If we make it – but prospects dim


DO I WANT TO DO THIS FOR THE LONG HAUL?
- Not really since tech problem is mostly not fun, and mgt is not mine
- Would be different if I were directing things?  Eh, not so much.  Would be interesting to win key engagements, but not just driving a BD pipe.

ARE WE GONNA MAKE IT?
-  Ok chance to get homeaway


- kinda don’t want leave this open, cause I don’t want them to get me to stay.



===========================
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- I wanted to be with someone a bit younger, who could have kids with me.
  If I am totally honest with myself, I also just imagined being with someone a bit
  younger generally.  
  
- Still this is just a general feeling, not one that I would be ready to act on at all.
  Indeed, the idea of just being open to what happens with us, seems nice.  I am open
  to the idea that not only am I super comefortable in your presence, but other 
  ways of being compatible will happen too.
  
- Indeed I feel that it is healthy for me, to be intimate with someone.  Two years is
  a long time.  I am lonely, and a little unbalanced by wanting contact _so_ much.
  So it is good for me to be with you, and maybe something more can come from 
  us.
  
- I am very open to building on this area of strength between us, and seeing
  how else we might fit together.  If is good for me, like water on parched earth.
  It is _fun_.  and it is wonderful.
  
  
  
  
But after tonight, I feel like I just don't like you enough....  maybe someday I would
like you enough, but I now wonder if it is even possible to date.













Karen:

I wanted time to try to hear what my heart is saying...  I have the sense that all of these
words can tear us apart, but still want to be true to myself and to you.

First things, about trust.  There is no way a person can be the one who tell another that
they should trust them...   that is also what an untrustworthy person would say too.
But if trust _is_ a critical issue here, then we must find a way for you to get that.
I am trustworthy.  PAINFULLY trustworthy.  so much that it causes me to make a mess out of
things as I have done here, by erring on the side of explicitness, just to avoid miscommunication
and to avoid unfairness to you.  Still if having greater trust would help things here, I dunno
I have lots of close friends who will laugh at the amount of trustworthiness in me, I am sure
they would be amused, but happy to tell a random person they don't know in CA about me.


But I do think there was real reason for me to speak up in the car.
I am proud of myself for having done so.  No one could ever accuse me of not being
correct or honest, had I simply let thing move forward on the path they were on.
But for me to gain from our relationship, at your expense, would be a wrong thing, even if
no one could ever blame me for it.  This is not who I am.


For me, what we have matters in two ways.  I am a social/intimate creature.
I miss sex, but there is no pain in my heart, without sex -- it is not critical.
But there is real pain, that I am not emotionally close to anyone.  These days with you
have been super wonderful.  I feel like a cactus, after drying in the endless heat of 
summer dry spell, now finds himself soaking in a torrential downfall.  It is glorious!
I love the presence of you, probably more, since it feels like forever since I have felt 
that spark in me, and in our touch.  But it is also about you too.  I don't think I have
ever been with someone so electric in her reactions to me.  It is all just wonderful!

The second way you matter is that you could be my partner.  I don't really have much thought
about that yet...  after our 'interviewing' it is clear that there are some important issues
to figure out, but we don't have to have them all figured out now.  There are lots of other
things about how we are with friends, and in lots of contexts besides smooching.  



Since that speed dating thing, I did go out with the Japanese teacher.  (A SAC, and
also very child-able and child-focused person.)  I wont go out with her again.  There just 
was not a connection there.  Still after being locked into relationships for most of my 30s
half of my 40s, I will not feel good to slide into another long relationship with a whimper
rather than a bang.  And I can tell if we start dating it will be long -- at least if it is good.  it will take months
for us to really get to know each other -- that whole time, I am wondering if I jumped too
quickly.  After all those years, a decade plus if you count both prior women, I am with 
the first girl I kissed?  I will think ``did I choose wisely?''  and I won't know the answer.


Now if we continue on, and over time it becomes clear that what we have is not something
I have with others, well that is a completely different picture.
But it is equally clear that jumping to that now is a disasterous path for me, and for us.




Still for me, spending time with you is an awesome thing.  For both reasons above it is just
great.  I think it is not healthy (or fun) for me to feel such a gap in intimacy.  It will
always be a half way thing, until I know I am with my life partner -- but still not having it
I fear can lead to me making bad choices.  And on the second thing, the only way to findout 
about the rest of you and me is to be with you to see.  There is the chance that being with
you I will get attached -- I will, and I already am.  Then _you_ wlll be the one who does
not want to continue -- because you found another, or simply because I am not the one.  I 
have felt this pain very directly and am not looking for a repeat performance.  Still overall
there is more positive than negative for me to continue seeing you -- romantically, or even 
more as friends holding romance in check.  I do want our intimacy, and I do want to see where
this all leads to.


But not at the expense of you.  It makes no sense to swim in the intimacy of you, and be
hurting you at the same time!  There is always the chance of real hurt, of course.  
Indeed if there is no chance of real hurt, then there is no real connection either.  So I am 
not so naive as to think I am get very close to you, and not take risks (for either of us.)
Still these should be risks that we are both ok taking.  And the risks should be somewhat 
equal... the power between us should be somewhat equal.  It cannot be you waiting to see
how things turn out ....  I also have to been looking to you with similar feelings.
This is what seemed like trouble in the car, and it is why I opened my mouth.

I WANT there to be a way forward, I WANT more of what we have!  but somehow in a context
where you don't feel 'shitty', and also where in addition, it _is_ a good thing for both
of us.



















I have been giving lo





    This is a test to see if I can show 

Ok let us see if I can type a mile a minute without looking at the keyboard.  Really I think I can it is a test of my memory of where the keys on the keyboard are...
