### 2023-10-17  List of schools from Qingling's friend

   
> > Hi Caille!
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > Sure thing. This is from my friend, Tiffani. It’s a little less snarky than I remember 😂. But I added in a few additions based on our experience. 
> > 
> > **SF Friends**
> > 
> > [https://www.sffriendsschool.org/](https://www.sffriendsschool.org/)
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > 15th and Valencia ish. This was my first choice. Strong Quaker underpinnings so: reflective, could articulate their approach really clearly, parent group seemed balanced and smart. Daily meditation. 
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > From Anna: people do love this place! It struck me as extra Silicon Valley—parents and educators who strive for the rigor and extreme achievement of prep school but also feel conflicted about wanting that. The result is a prep school wrapped in California chill “vibes.” My husband went to Quaker school which maybe influenced our perspective.

> > [https://www.cds-sf.org/](https://www.cds-sf.org/)
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > 16th and Dolores. My last choice but the choice we got into within walking distance, and Sloane’s best friends were / are there. Strong social justice orientation (ex: first graders making signs about Defund the Police). Excellent operations and admin, fun and supportive parent community, Sloane says she doesn’t love her teachers but begs me to keep her in since her friends are there. I think of taking her out daily but seems like I’m the only parent who thinks like this — other parents will tear up about how good the school is 🤷🏻‍♀️

> >   
> > 
> > Portola. This is the one I wish we’d gone to, especially since now we drive from Noe to Mission each day. Strong Spanish and science orientation - progressive and constructivist but a bit more thoughtful in implementing this  as far as I can tell. 
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > From Anna: we were down to AVS and Live Oak. AVS is a STEM school. It’s newer, scrappier, and more experimental. I work with a lot of engineers and saw many similarities—focused, a bit reserved, pragmatic but not extra outgoing. Noticeably less arts/culture inclined but super down to earth and unpretentious. 
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > **From Anna: Live Oak**
> > 
> > This is where we’re going. We walked in and it just felt right. Thoughtful and self-aware parents who all talked about valuing a tight community and raising kids to be good, well-rounded humans. There’s a lot of noticeable marketing language but I found it to be pretty authentic. I love how this school feels like it’s in and part of the city. Everywhere else we looked felt a bit more removed.
