- JUMP PAGE - Any string before a "!" in spot_cmds.txt defines a jump page.  It should be associated with exactly one jump page within the kmr folder tree having the same name.
	- MISSING - If the page does not exist, a blank one is created under the JJ folder.
	- DUP - If more than one, then the word "ERROR: Multiple notes w/ same name"
- JUMP BLOCK - 
- JUMP MENU - Any jump page with an all caps name is a jump menu.  Such pages auto translate all
