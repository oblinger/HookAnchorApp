### 2025-05-12  Brainstorm behavior generators

**Goal**:  build hard-structured behavior generators using gen-AI
**Example**:  Energy pathway generators.

- Learn about MCP interfaces and systems.


1. [1d] TEMPLATES—Define the parametric pathway, e.g., the number of cycles and shunt paths, the steps in each, and the reactions in each step. 
2. [1d] REACTIONS - Define goal-directed parametric chem reaction generator:  num inputs, outputs, tiny molecules, catalysts, bio-molecule reuse. 
3. [2d] CODE GENERATORS - 
4. [1d] HACK DATA - Eyeball terrestrial data to configure generators.
5. [2d] CODE INTERPRETER - 
6. [1d] CODE SIMULATOR - 
7. [??] CODE SIM TWEAKER - 
- [ ] [??] Code: Task Generator with variable complexity (discovery only tasks)
- [ ] [3d] Code: MCP interface & API
- [ ] [2d] Code: Experiment #1 

#### BDEPTH

yes lets define biosynthetic depth (bdepth) recursively. Essential nutrients, small molecules, etc. have a bdepth of 0. Derived molecules have a depth 1 greater than the max bdepth of all inputs for the reaction that gives it the smallest possible depth.

#### Molecular Generators
- 
#### Anabolic Generators

- Pick one primary reactant
- 0, 1, or occasionally more other reactants

### 2025-05-07 Fast Path
- [ ] Code:  	Reactions Web Generator
- [ ] Code:  	Behavior Generators:  (1) Energy Transport,  (2) Anabolic Pathways,  (3) Cantbolic Pathways
- [ ] Code:	Simulators (just runs reactions and scripts)
- [ ] Code:	World Spec Generator.  Hard-coded generator of system behavioral targets
- [ ] Code:	Full world weaver, uses inputs above and simulator to produce full world system, and edit system until it behaves as expected.
- [ ] Code:	Disease Generator.  Systematically damages working behaviors io induce pathologies
- [ ] Code:	Task Generator with variable complexity
- [ ] Experiment #1:  Compare 10 Chat systems' ability to model production rates give changes of inputs
- [ ] Experiment #2:  Cure a disease.  Measure sthe system's performance at adjusting diseased systems to correct them.
