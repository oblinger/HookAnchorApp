#### Implementation of C++ multiple inheritance
https://web.archive.org/web/20160413064252/http://www.phpcompiler.org/articles/virtualinheritance.html

#### Efficient multi-inheritance (hybrid approach)

Tasks:
(1) find out if there is a path from one node to another
(2) retrieve all notes which a path exists to
(3) find the least common ancestor for a set of nodes

Uses interval-based and gene-based approaches

#### GREENSPUN LISP LAW


Greenspun’s tenth rule:

“Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.”

In this BOF we consider the possibility of a clean, embeddable, homoiconic langauge for meta-prorgramming in practical applications.

#### Universal Space of Datastructures

https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/periodictabledatastructures.pdf



=== There approach for finding the principles ===
Thus, we focus on discovering, structuring and understanding the first principles of layout design. This is
a trial and error process, i.e., there is no explicit algorithm. There is a
high-level recipe
, though. The recipe is
about iterating between two processes: 1) decomposing existing data structures into first principles, and 2) stress
testing the design space by attacking open problems through its structure.

Edward,

This email is a bit out of the blue, but I have done some digging and I think your interests and background make you uniquely qualified to have an opinion on some work I have been doing in the last few years.  You can check me out HERE.  My background is PhD ML/AI, worked at IBM Watson, taught at columbia, been a DARPA PM, and recently the CTO for a robotics company.

I have been working on applying some AI/representation ideas to programming languages, and collaboration frameworks.  You also have a background in AI/ML but add to that for formal experience in programming languages, and an interest in new programming langauages & paradigms.

If you have the time and interest I would love to show you what I have been up to in a call -- my primary aim is to situate what I am doing within the larger programming langauges universe.  (it seems to be pretty unique from my perspective, but its a big world out there, and maybe I s)
I would love to take 
, but add to that a formal background in programming langauges.
