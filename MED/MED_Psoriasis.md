      - Scalp clear for several years.  Ear canals only place on body affected. 
        Will try lotion daily. 
     
    7/1/97 
      - Stopped all treatment for 2mo.  Scalp went nuts. 
      - Used #9 for several months.  Sporadic. Some improvement but still red & one 
        patch still thick with scale. 
      - Applied #9 1/day and #7 1/day for 1 month.  Cleared patch. 
      - Went to #9 1/day alone. (9/1) 
     
    10/1/96  
        Scalp quickly reduced flaking, but is still uneven (bumpy), still flakes. 
        Ears are better; I have rarely been taking #8. will start daily treatment. 
     
    8/21/96 Started using #7 & #8. 
        #7 Is a step up (stronger) than #6 
        #8 Is weak, to be used on sensitive areas.  Minimizes skin thinning. 
        Placed perscription in VIP folder. 
     
    '95 Used #6.  Applied twice a day for 3-5mo. (Winter/Spring) 
        Cleared scalp for 2mo.  Then started again in many spots on body. (Summer) 
     
    '94 Used #5.  Appled off and on for several months. 
        Worked well on body, and somewhat well on scalp. 
        Stoped.  Started after several months again on scalp, did not 
        work well. 
     
    '89 Used #4.  Don't think it worked.
