    Dr. kw. 
     
    I found your book ''The age of spiritual machines'' truly riviting.  I 
    couldn't put it down.  I have long believed some of the claims in you 
    make, yet perhaps because I was raised during the AI winter I believed  
    they were much further off.  As with any turning point,  small changes 
    at the fulcrum will have greatly magnified consequences on into the 
    future.  I feel the weight of responsibility upon us. 
     
    Let me stop and introduce myself.  I am Research Staff at the IBM T.J. 
    Watson research center.  I recently finished my graduate work at the 
    University of Illinois, where I specialized in Machine Learning 
    (Knowledge-based learning from imprecise (non-deductive) background 
    knoweldge).  I am basically an optimist like you.  If it can be done, 
    humanity will do it, both the good and the bad.   
     
    Like you, I am also a pragmatist.  If tomorrow there is an entity that says 
    it is Dan Oblinger, it has my memories, behaviors, and "pattern", then 
    lets just call it me.  Indeed following your story, the eventual "Dan" 
    wont even be that much like me, since he has evolved so much.  That is 
    ok, after all, we are not the same as those of a 100,000 years ago, 
    and we're ok, right?  Why should "my" point on the spiral be the 
    "right" one?  Still if we were more like the #### who were out gunned 
    technologically, wiped out, and had no role in the future, that 
    wouldn't be ok.  I want the future to be inhabited by things that are 
    derived as directly as possible from us.  Call me parochical.  If 
    you share this conviction, then perhaps we share a common agenda. 
     
    Your law of accelerating returns predicts that "progress" will 
    continue, but offers no assurance whatsoever to mere humans.  Indeed, 
    it predicts that MOSHs will *not* be central for much longer.  What 
    are the concerns here?  For the moment let us take on the mantle of 
    the protector, of the "human pattern".  Let us be an optimist in our 
    assumtions about technology---that it will move at the pace you 
    suggest, but let us be skeptical in our assumptions regarding the 
    relative benevolance of those weilding this new power.  What can go 
    wrong? 
     
    (1) BLOWING OUT THE CANDLE.  As technology become more powerful, smaller 
        and smaller groups of individuals will, if determined, be able 
        to extinguish the whole process. 
    (2) BAD TIMING.  We are outrun too quickly.  The technology necessary  
        for humanities participation in this new world is not available  
        until long after we are well surpassed by the abilities of purely 
        synthetic technology. 
    (3) LIMITED RESOURCES.  The need for the fruits of technology may 
        track exponentially with the technology itself, thus we never have  
        "all the computation you need" as you suggest in your book, there is  
        still struggle for resource, a strugle that 12 billion humans do not 
        win. 
    (4) AN EXPONENTIAL PROCESS.  A "bad" exponential process is unleashed  
        that dominates all else. 
     
        Can you think of other categories? 
     
    Let me take each of these in turn.... 
     
     
    These four threats share a common theme, they hinge on the outcome of  
    opposing exponential trends.  The strenght of both the affirming and  
    inhibiting forces in each case riding an exponential curve, thus relatively 
    short time lags either way will determine whether affiriming or inhibiting 
    forces dominate.  For example, our ability to detect, disable, or ameliorate, 
    destructive technology is growing exponentially, but so is our ability to 
    do harm.  Why curve dominates, depends what fraction of our resources 
    are expended on advancement in each direction.  (In many cases, the  
    technologies are so intertwined, that it is unfortunately not possible to 
    even differentiate between technology that primarily advances in one direction 
    from technology that advances primarily in the other.)
