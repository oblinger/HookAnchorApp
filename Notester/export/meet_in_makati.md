    Joan,

    Your profile says banking.  what is it that you do?  (as for me I own a small company with several friends -- its a computer company)

    I will be in Manila for a week on my way home (I got some dental work done in Thailand).  I think I will be back to PHI on a second trip this year too.

    Maybe we could have a coffee on your lunch break while I am here?
    Chatting electronically is a fine thing, but I find that you really can know someone
    in a different way after you have seen them face to face.

    Anyway, I do love your profile, and am happy to be chatting with you.

    Cheers, 
    Dan
