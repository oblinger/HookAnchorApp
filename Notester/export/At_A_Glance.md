    - Remove ADULT tag
    - Printing error
    - Shortcut on desktop



    TODO:
    (1) Replace "WMR" with "Reading Recognition" in "splash.bmp"-- the software is not called "Reading Recognition". 
        Peter would know if "IBM Corporation" is still ok or if it should be "Don Johnston, Inc". 
        This also applies to the "Application Error" window, and the first screen that comes up after "splash.bmp". 
    (2) enable the "sparse data" option for all reports when selected, rather than just the single report it's now an option on
    (3) Use new JRE
    (4) Change key used by software:  
         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\IBM\Reading Recognition\Values\UserPath
