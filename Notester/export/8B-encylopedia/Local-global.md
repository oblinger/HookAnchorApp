# 8B-encylopedia.Local-global --

    IDEA: Local/Global navigation 
     
    Motivation:  
    - keywords are good because high branching factor 
      keywords are bad because they require user to be generative 
    - static taxonomy is good because user need *not* be generative 
      static taxonomy is bad because it has a relatively low branching factor, and 
      because ``distant'' choices are hard to make.
