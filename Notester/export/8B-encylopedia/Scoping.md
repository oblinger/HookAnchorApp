     <<>>       *OLD* Description of the scoping idea 
     
     
    K-means clustering 
    given N starting points 
     
    pick k 
    do vournoi 
     
    find K-centroids

    Clever2 -- Focus crawling 
    Given tree & docs in tree 
     
     
    PROBLEMS: 
    - Given taxonomy populate it with best web pages 
      - Best = most referenced, on topic, appropriate scope 
    - Given concept find most useful pages 
    - Given web find useful pages or concepts 
     
     
    IDEA: 
    - Use CLEVER to extend propedia by searching on concept tags in propedia 
    - Generate new labels by text extraction.  Organize on them. 
    - Do a tree of CLEVER searches in parallel 
    * Given a cloud of words (from documents) do a focused clever search 
      * Compute differential word list by focusing on words that discriminate 
        docs in tree 
    * Global/Local navigation.  Keywords provide multiple entry points into tree 
      Then local navigation can be used.  Dynamically build alternative senses tree 
     
    ISSUES: 
    - Clever, one concept at a time verses in parallel 
    - Impt. concepts swallow details 
     
     
    QUESTIONS: 
    - Licencing of CLEVER? 
      by party 
    - How long to crawl the web?

    Old Ideas: 
    - Free market bidding for the right to provide query answers 
    - Use clever to determine which pages to MANUALLY organize 
      - easy look carefully at in links. 
    - Get Main Topics to link w. hierarchy 
    - Get concepts link w. other nodes w. similar concepts 
    - Compute similarity to docs in existing hierarchy

    CLEVER  
    query 
    altavista 
    in/out of all pages 
     
     
     
    CLEVER = HITS + text near analysis 
     
    get query 
    get root set from alta 
    - high weight if query word near out link to $page$ 
    - document as a chain 
    - removing redundancy in hubs 
    - tune endorsement on site host stucture 
     
    Hub = many out 
    Authority = many in
