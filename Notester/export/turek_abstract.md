    Next Web Interfaces

    The next generation web group at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center is exploring the architectural elements that will make up the distributed computing platform of the future.  In this I will give a short outline of our work in the Next Generation Application platform which proposes a unified programming model across both client and server.  I will then focus on delivery of the end user experience on the client and talk about some of the technologies that will alter the way we interact with computers.  I will complete the talk by discussing some of the challenges that still need to be addressed in order to realize the vision presented during the talk.
