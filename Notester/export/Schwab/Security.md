    SUMMARY OF SECURITY AT SCHWAB 
     
    (1) The only way that my Schwab investments can be stolen is through: 
        By Schwab One Debit Card 
           $500 Liability if notified within 60day of stmt.   (SAFE) 
        By Schwab Internet Account 
           Responsible for all tranactions using my password. 
           Can only Xfr to my bank w. different pwd???        (SAFE??) 
        By Schwab Checks. 
           ??????                                             (?????) 
        By Written instructions  (EFT or by wire) 
           Add a verbal password                              (REASONABLY SAFE)
