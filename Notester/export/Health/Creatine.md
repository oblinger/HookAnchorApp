    - 20-30g loading for 5-6 days  (.3g per kg body weight)
    - then .03g per kg body

    Better is to take 
    - 5g for 30 days.  less water retention


    <<>>
    - loading has no effect beyond 48-hours, thus best load for 2days then maintaince
    - or 10g for 10weeks (anthing less than 5g is not going to have an effect.
