    Bio as app.
    All known life is constructed from proteins.
    Remarkable building blocks are constructed from from a linear sequence
    of amino acids.  20 acids (represented by an alpha letter)
    Any protein can be described as a long string of alpha characters (primary seq)
    Shape is 3-space is its structure.
    Recently developed semi-automated techniques have been
    very successful in determining the composition of many
    proteins.
    In 1995 the first indep. organism was determined.
    When the influenza virus ... it introduced 17xx new proteins.
    Within days biologists were trying to determine the fn of these new proteins.
    This is done is by looking for proteins with known fn that
    have a similar composition.
    This is effective method since proteins with very similar composition
    implies the same general shape and often same fn.
    The converse does not necessarily hold.  Proteins with similar shape and
    function may have different composition.
