    Dr. Brin, 
     
    I have long been a fan of your Sci Fi writings.  Your ability to 
    vividly extrapolate the personal impact of a different anatomy, a  
    different social structure, or new technology is truely unique.   
    When I heard that you had written a book exploring the ramifications 
    of technology on privacy, I knew that I had to read it.   
     
     
    As expected ``The Transparent Society'' provided involving glimpses 
    of possible consequences of various choices society might make  
    regarding information.  In fact, I believe your strongest constribution 
    to this ongoing discussion may be to provide visceral text that 
    lets us all <<>> what these alternative futures could be like. 
     
     
    As a researcher in the field of Data Mining/Machine Learning I  
    feel it incumbent upon myself to understand and help direct the 
    social consequenceses of these new technologies.  As you state in  
    your book the task of defining privacy policy 
    ``In the long run, it will come down to us [the citizens], deciding 
    what we want.''  So lets get to it. 
     
     
    I agree with many conclusions drawn in the book. 
    There is one assumption 
     
     
    In my thinking about this issue I have found it useful to  
    divide the world into three groups (1) the government, (2) buisnesses, 
    and (3) individuals.
