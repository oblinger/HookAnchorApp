# Drop\_Box --

    (contacts)

    === sharable dropbox ===

    I created a drop box account we can use:
    <<>>    Sign In with username  share@oblinger.us    and password:  shareshare


    === USAGES ===
    - FILESYS:      Just create/edit files under <<>> my-dir
    - PUB LINK:     Other users can read files from this folder



    === CHANGING THE FOLDER NAME ===
    - download pyDropboxPath
    - exit Dropbox
    - mv dropbox folder to new location
    - run <<>>
    - Change path to new folder location/name
