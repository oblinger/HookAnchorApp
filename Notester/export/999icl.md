# 999icl -- Interaction control language

    --- 
    Levels of integration 
    * Non-reversable updates to single current environment (today's OS) 
    * Recomputable single current environment 
    * Switchable single current environment 
    * Multiple process specific current environments 
     
    * Continuous Filesystem update monitoring 
    * Continuous Registry monitoring

    Motivation 
    - Sliding upgrade. 
      Upgrades are time-expensive and dangerous. 
      Allow org to partially and reversibly upgrade  
      - partial by machine, by user, and by ??interacting application??

    Summary  
    - ALL behavior defining aspects of a computing system is captured by its 
      current environments. 
    - Environments are componential, effectively deterministic, recursive, 
      and their interactions are declaratively expressed
