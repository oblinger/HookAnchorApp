# Personal.Phils\_Party --


    I'll probably stay at my brother's place if they don't put me up in a hotel.
    Maybe we should try Opaline?  Feel free to keep your eyes open for possibilities.

    I think I'll be coming back February 6-9.  Friday night to Monday afternoon.

    Maybe you can call them up and reserve the back area with the tables?
    The number is (212) 995-8684.  It would be for Saturday, February 7.
    What do you think, 9:30?
    And I would guess there will be less people, since I already had the big farewell party - maybe 50-75 people?
