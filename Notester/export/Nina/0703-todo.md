    CLUSTERING PROBLEM 
      Write Def of clustering (metric, error, confidence, holdout) ?? 
      if lenny comes thru on conceptual clustering 
      * k-median over R^D 
     
    APPROXIMATE (independent of n) CLUSTERING SOLUTION 
    * our approach: compute approapriate sample size; draw sample; run  
      approximate clustering alg 
     
    - sample size computation (and proof) 
      Lemma 1 - Thm 6 
     
    GENERALIZATION and APPLICATIONS OF WAY-SUBLINEAR CLUSTERING 
    - Dimensionality reduction. When D is much greater than N 
    - When we don't know M 
    - Discrete vs. Continuous 
    - Property Testing 
       
     
    PAC CLUSTERING 
     - Lenny's ball
