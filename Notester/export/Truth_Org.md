                       ******************************************

    HONEST         --  Organization executes it stated tasks honestly according to that stated constraints and biases.
    WISE           --  Unbiased, consistently, with attention to nuance 
    UNCORRUPTABLE  --  There is no way for individuals or conspiring groups to operate within the 
                       organization and cause it to operate dishonestly (outside stated constraints and biases).
                       --->  The organization is protected from abuse by the public
    TRANSPARENT    --  The organization can be known to be honest by the general public (who are not part of the orgnaization).
                       --->  The public is protected from abuse by the organization 
    SELF-WORKING   --  The organization achieves these objectives by virtues of its laws and operating procedures, it makes
                       as few assumptions as possible regarding the motives of those inside (or outside) the orgnazation.
    EFFECTIVE      --  Organization completes its stated tasks with some acceptable degree of efficiency.





    BENEFITS      If such an organizations could be created, they would make the world much safer 

    * Creating indigenous corruption control in very unstable, very corrupt, or newly formed nations.

    * Verifylbe methods for providing large amounts of aid without corruption/diviersion of funds

    * Methods for identifying terrorists within the states that ensure civil liberties of our citizens

                        **  KEY METHODS  **
                        *******************


    SELF TESTING --  
    The organization continuously tests itself in ways that will reveal dishonesty even when many
    in the org are conspiring to thwart those tests.

    PUBLIC DISCLOSURE --  
    The organization discloses most details about its own testing in a way that does not invalidate
    the effectiveness of the tests, but does allow the public to verify the effectiveness of the testing.

    TEMPORAL SECRECY --
    The fact that information cannot be pushed back in time can be used to construct situations where
    honesty can be verified by knowledge available only in the future, yet that knowledge cannot be used
    in the past to disguise dishonesty since it is phyically not availble at the time.

    DISTRIBUTED PARTIAL KNOWLEDGE -- 
    Decentralized self-testing involves incomplete knowledge to different organization-members at different
    times in a way that ensures that members (or groups) cannot know when or how to act dishonestly without 
    begin revealed after the fact. 

    MESSAGE SUBSTRATE:  PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION, MESSAGES, AND THE MESSAGE LOG
    * Public-key encryition can be used to create meassages that can only be seen by specific others members.
      It is possible to send messages to other member so they do not know who sent it (until later in the future).   (I am not positive about this one)
    * Members can record messages into a publically-released, time-stamped, log of messages, and later provide
      the decryption key for those messages.  In that way the world can verify in the future what that member
      knew in the past without the world actually knowing the contents of the message in the past.
    * Tricks like using large fixed size message blocks (regardless of message content size), and sending all messages
      to all members and to the log, allows messaging and recording to be done by individual members with no one knowing 
      who is doing what until after the fact.
    * Publically disclosed hardware/software ensures the sofware's behavior is known to all.


    **************************************************************************************
    **  ACHIEVING VERIFABLE HONESTY IN THE FACE OF EXTREME AND SOPHISTICATED COLLUSION  **
    **************************************************************************************

    The organization checks and proves its honesty through a collection of self tests.

    * The integrity of the tests rely heavily on the integrity of the messaging softare
      thus each member purchases and configures their own messaging node following a 
      published procedure, using hardware and software materials obtain from an open
      collection of sources in a way that guarantees the public knows precisely (byte-for-byte)
      what is on each node constructed honestly according to the published procedure.

    * The tests are designed so that even a single honest member executing these tests
      will uncover sophisticated and widespread collusion in the organization, and the
      results of these tests designed to be unknown to everyone until a precise point
      in the future when decrpytion key is released.  At that point the results of the
      test can be computed by everyone.  (even the releasing of the encryption key
      is guaranteed to never happen in secret.  See collaboratively controlled keys release.)

    * The self tests are divided into two categories, the first category is designed to
      test the basic honesty of individuals in the orgnaization in carrying out their duties.
      The second set of tests are more esoteric and are designed to 
      (1) Test for very sophisticated and/or very wide spread conspiracies  
          (e.g. tests that will still reveal dishonesty even whne 99% of whole orgaization is part secret second orgnaization colluding to decive public)
      (2) Provide ways for the most skeptical members of the general population to verify operations of the organization.
          (e.g. becuase so much of the activities of this org become public after the fact, esoteric tests can be run so that 
           a ultra-skeptical, conspiricy-minded, public citizens can verify that many broad categories of possible conspiracies cannot be happening.
           The goal is to feed extremely detailed information to interested non-organization members in the general citizenry in a way that
           they can check out their favorite conspiracy theory.  A large community of such people can provide good and reassuring coverage of the
           organization.  Because those most distant from the organization and those most skeptical can spend their efforts verifying its
           activities, the larger public can feel confident in its overall honesty. 
       **  IMPORTANT:  This only works as long as there do not exist plausible conspiracy theories which cannot be verified by the ultra-skeptic.
           This is why spending some time on the esoteric tests is important, since it provides the means for the ultra-skeptic to test their theories.


    The amount of resources devoted to these different types of self tests can be dictated by the policy making public
    in a way that provides the desired levels of assurances against different types of disception.

    **  MESSAGING SUBSTRATE  **
    ***************************

    Many tests (especially the extreme tests) are only guaranteed to be effective when
    the messaging and logging systems are incorruptable.  

    Here are the precautions taken to ensure that the messaging system is secure, and here
    are the transparency measures taken to allow the ultra-skeptic in the public to verify
    correct operation of the nodes and logging stations that comprise the messaging net.

    Each member of the organization purchases, and configures their own messaging node.
    If the member is honest and follows the procedure outlined in the next section they are 
    guaranteed to construct a system that is precisely known (down to the indivdual byte level)
    by the community of ultra-skeptics.  They collectively verify that no secret society
    can watch or manipulate nodes of the network owned by honest oranization members.





     *  Only published, mathematically understood, data-handling algorithms and encryption schemes
        are employed as part of the net.
     *  The source code for all of the software that runs the messaging net is publically available from
        many sources on the internet.  The executable form is never available online, rather is it is compiled
        from the source code from a random publicly available site directly on the members machine.
     *  Even the compiler used to create the messaging net software is only available in source-code form.
     *  The only executable available online is a single "fixed for all time" publicly available micro-interpreter +
        byte-comparison tool + MD5 file finger print utility.  (This tool is used to very securely and very transparently
        create a new node on the message net.)
     *  Off the shelf hardware from many sources are used by the members.
     *  Multiple versions of multiple operating systems are used by the members.
     
     *  The only out-bound network traffic generated by the machine is a single stream of a fixed number of bytes 
        generated by the networking system per second (24 hours a day 7 days a week)
     *  The only in-bound network traffic generated by the machine is a single coellated stream of all streams from
        all other members.
     *  Many logging stations on the internet set up both by ultra-skeptics and by the organization are recording
        the master stream for later verification purposes.


    GUARANTEES ENSURED BY THE MESSGING SYSTEM

     * Only intended recipients can decript a message
     * Only the intended recipient even know that a message was sent 
       (remember each machine's output is a fix bytes/second sent to all machines and all logging services)
     * All messages 


     
    Building a new member's messaging machine.  These steps are designed to create a new machine
    on the message net in a way that the public can verify that no secret society could "slip"
    something into the message substrate without the collusion of *EVERY* member of the honesty orgnization.
    Said in another way, an organizaton member not part of the society following this procedure would unwittingly
    create a node on the message network that could not have any unknown spyware.

    (1) A new machine is purchase in an uncontrolled fashion on the open market by the member.
    (2) A fresh version of the OS is placed on the machine.
    (3) Many copies of the micro-interpreters are downloaded and executed.  The first thing they do
        is to check that they are byte-for-byte identical to all other copies downloaded.
    (4) Many copies from many open sources for all of the software is downloaded under member control
        from any of the public sources (including sources controlled by the ultra skeptics)
    (5) One of the identical copies of the micro interpreters are used to check that all downloaded
        source codes are identical.  Members are publically told of internet sources known to present counterfit
        data.  But members are not told where they can get their source codes, they are encouraged to seek
        out a diverse collection which includes at least one honesty orginazation source and at least several
        ultra-skeptic sources.
    (6) All downloaded sources are byte-for-byte compared to ensure they are identical.  violations are publically 
        announced by the individual memebers discovering it.
    (7) The micro interpreter is used to interpret the compiler in order to compile itself.
    (8) The newly compiled compiler is used to compile that users node on honety.net

    If we want to be really really secure against collusion, we could have the micro-interpreter first burned onto
    a CD-ROM which is then booted instead of the operating system.  Once the whole process is complete, one of hundreds
    of different byte-comparison software out on the market could be used to ensure that the CD-ROM that the *exact* bytes
    that are published on the many sites on the internet.  

    This super secure approach would guarantee that an honest member would construct a machine whose precise make up (down to the last
    byte on the machine) would be known, and introspectable by the ultra-skeptics.
