    * bias is output from leraning

    * Small lex delta means limited hypspace delta
    * Understandable

    - Concepts are recursively built up from constituents automatically
      as thinking is occuring.

    We can build complete-control systems, 
    - we dont have systems that bootstrap rep & alg.
    - we wont program the first thinking machine  (except at the lowest level)
      we wont even architect the most interesting peices

    Is common sense reason primal or ephemeral in human cog processing?
    Is FO-like (variable binding) resoning primary or ephemeral?

    right rep @ right time.

    The associator save and retrieves patterns.


    FEED FORWARD ACTIVATION
    - Patterns trip other patterns
    - Detect surprising connections
    - FO structure recognized and collapsed into non-FO pattern nodes.



    RETRIEVAL METHODS
    - Direct retrieval of tokens, patterns, and threads
    - Retrieval of similar elements to a target
    - Retrieval of containing elements from fragments of elements.


    ASSOCIATION
    - Creation of new tokens to represent the


    TOKEN
    - A TOKEN is a newly created symbol token.
    - The symbol is "defined" by a vector of activated "children" tokens.
    - It is the basic building block for patterns stored in the associator.


    PATTERN
    - A pattern is a gensym defines an observed or imagined pattern among a
      set of tokens.
    - For example "Dan bought the book" could be captured as:
      D="Dan", B="Book", P="Purchase", P1="Purchaser", P2="Purchasee",
      DP=<<>>, BP=<<>>, PATTERN=DPB=<<>>

    THREAD
    - A sequence of patterns.

    Build Scaffold model of graphs representing computing systems,
    and code algorithms for diagnosis and recovery over general graphs.

    Have the system *learn* the many instantiations of this model.



    (1) Hard code
        - Instrumentation for system inspection
        - Instrumentation for operator monitoring
        - Instrumentation for action exeuction (optional)

    (2) Write
        - Simple graph model of computing system
          (specific system would be a complex expansion/instantiation of this
           simple graph)
        - General algorihms for diagnosis; inspection and repair
          over these graphs.

    (3) K-Acquistion system fills in details in scaffolding
        - Restricted learning of expectations and detectiong
          of triggers from watching system and operator.
        - Active leraning of PK.
        - Learning from text????

    So you learn:
    - TCP/IP drivers for Win2000 is a communication layer.
    - They run only when the hardware port is working and connected.
