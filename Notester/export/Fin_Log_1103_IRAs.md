    - Switch to Roth?  (how<<>>when to take distributions?)
    - Other 

    =IDEA= -- Contribute to a TRADITIONAL IRA  (Post tax <<>> NON-DEDUTCTABLE)  (upto $5000 <<>>  no income limits)
      - Only advantage is that the tax on gains is taken at end 
        (which theoretically might be lower than cap gains.)
      - If tax rate on now is LESS than the capital gains rate when I retire then I save
      - Generally not worth the lost of flexibility in having money in IRA

    =IDEA=  -- Roll IRA into Roth
      - Biggest advantage is locking in current tax rate (if you worry that tax structure will be higher in retirement)
      - Also after 5 years, money contributed can be pulled out w/o penalty
      - Especially relevant if I drop to very low income bracket because of startup
