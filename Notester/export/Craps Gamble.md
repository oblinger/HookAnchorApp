    21day * 4hours * 30bets/hr * .07 = $176.4   estimated total cost thru 2015/01
    30bets/hr * .07/bet = $2.10


    ====
    If I made 1,000 $5 bets.  I would have spent $5 * 1000 and have won $5 * 2 * 493wins =  $5 * -14 = -$70
    So all bets cost 7,000 cents, 7 cents for each of the 1,000 bets

    Precise odds of winning pass line bet:  244/495
