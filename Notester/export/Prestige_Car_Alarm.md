    HOW TO DISABLE
    Answer
    If installed correctly, the valet/overide
    switch would be at your left foot area
    or directly under the dash. It's either
    a flip switch or, a push type switch.
    Put the key in the ignition, and turn forward
    all the way just before cranking. Then within
    5 seconds, press and hold in the valet/overide
    button, found under the dash area,
    until the installed LED (the blinking light)
    in your dash area goes on solid, and the siren chirps once.
    (Your valet switch might be the toggle (on/off) type.
    in this case, key on, flip switch in opposite direction,
    key off.)

    If you do not find one, then you'll need to locate
    the brain box under the dash, and unplug it.
    I would replace it either way.
    Your car is really simple to steal.

    Let me know how it goes.
