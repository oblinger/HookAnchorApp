    Cho-Dang-Gol  (I bet I am miss spelling this)  Country style Korean--they have lots of hand made tofu dishes.     (There is a nice dessert place we could go to afterward nearby)
    Meskerem.  Ethiopian.  Small neighborhood kind of place, good food.
    Sushiden.  Japanese.   Somewhat upscale sushi shop.  Good quality sushi.
    Menchanko-Tei.  Japanese.  Fun noodle shop.  really tasty dishes.  definitely a place to go if you want Japanese but don't want sushi.
