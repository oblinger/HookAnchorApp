    - Innovative claims are not innovative.
    - Talk at level of base technologies (like SVM) but not about proposed innovative uses of them for MR
    - Phase 2-5 reserach goals mention use of tech components, but as such are thin research goals.

    - Nearly zero deep connection to specific difficulties presented by text, along with proposed
      approaches for dealing with them.

    - TEAM does not have sufficeint depth in extracting structure from text.
