    Well I guess my big news 

    DARPA JOB
    I am loving my job at DARPA.  I get to work with some of the strongest researchers 
    across the nation, and get to conceive and manage some pretty freaky research projects.
    I have one, trying to build computers that are mentored as an alternative to programming.
    The basic idea is that you would teach (demonstrated, explain, etc.) how a task was to be 
    done, rather than coding it.  A second program is trying to translate any natural text into 
    a formal knowledge base that encodes the same information.  (Yeah, both are pretty much 
    sci-fi at this point... but hey that is what makes them fun to attack)

    FAMILY LIFE
    Work keeps me more busy that I would like.  Between the cracks, I head up to NYC where
    my girlfriend lives/works.  She is a clothing designer, so there is not alot of fashion
    here in DC for her.  (I love NYC too, so I don't mind the frequent trips.)
