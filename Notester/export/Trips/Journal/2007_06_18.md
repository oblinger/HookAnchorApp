    I've just worked up the agenda in more detail.  You guys will want to arrive around lunchtime Monday in time for the team leader project overview briefings at 1300 and stay through 1800 on tuesday when all the detailed PI presentations are complete (including the related seedling efforts and the evaluation frameworks and domains).  You don't need to be there -- although you're always welcome of course -- Monday morning to hear me speak to the PI's or for the team meetings, nor Wednesday when we'll have working sessions on evaluation planning, a discussion of transition ideas, and more team meetings.
     
    So you should be able to fly to CA Monday morning and depart on a red-eye Tuesday night as a minimal time commitment and still get the information you will find useful.
