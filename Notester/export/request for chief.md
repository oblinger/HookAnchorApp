    request for chief


    I am looking hard for a "chief of staff" type person to collaborate tightly with me on my new program(s) here at DARPA.  I believe this position has many attractive features for the right candidate:

    * We will be working on some of the most forward looking basic research programs at DARPA.
    * We will be working closely with some of the very strongest researchers in AI.
    * In structuring and executing these programs we will be wrestling with some deep questions in representation and machine learning.

    I am looking for someone with the AI background to play in this space, and with the experience and skill to help in the management and leadership of these programs.

    If you know of candidates that would be interested, and have the experience I invite you to forward their information to me, as I am quite active now in trying to select an appropriate person for this lead support person role.

    Thanks,
    Dan Oblinger
