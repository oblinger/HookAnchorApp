    - muni bonds
    - tax managed funds.
      medium 5-7 year time horizons generally capture 90% of gains of long term bond funds
      MorningStar recommends average of AA quality (allows capturing some higher yielding stuff)
    - growth funds in the IRA

    - Use a fund of funds; rather use life cycle fund???



    Large Fund Asset Size
    - Biggest problem for growth funds (small & large cap)
    - Very bad for small cap growth
    - Very bad for funds that trade alot    <--- indeed this is the key factor





    TERMS
    - Beta.  coorelation coefficient between fund<<>>stock and some benchmark
    - Alpha. under<<>>overperformance of fund<<>>stock relative to riskless return (t-bills)
      = fundPerf - risklessReturn - beta * benchmark      (I think)
    - Sharpe Ratio.  compares across fund categories (w. different benchmarks)
      = (fundPerf - risklessReturn) <<>>  standardDeviationOfFund
