    The salad\vegetable\protein possibilities are great and can be within 
    the daily 20 gram carb allowance. Here are some suggestions, based on 
    stuff that I like eating: 
     
    Thinly sliced raddichio, endive and fennel with a fresh basil 
    dressing. Sprinkle with crisp bacon and goat's cheese. Eat with 
    roasted chicken. 
     
    Raw, sauteed or grilled mushrooms on romaine with blue cheese 
    dressing. Eat with a steak. 
     
    Fry some peppers, mushrooms and garlic. Serve on arugula, sprinkle 
    with feta cheese and eat with good Italian sausages. 
     
    Thinly slice cucumbers, radishes and celery. Toss with lemon 
    mayonnaise and serve on butter lettuce. Have a piece of salmon 
    alongside. Sprinkle with fresh dill. Cook some asparagus and Swiss 
    chard. Serve a piece of halibut, cod or sole on top and drown it with 
    Hollandaise sauce. 
     
    Sauteed spinach, julienned daikon seasoned with soya sauce and a few 
    drops of sesame oil. Grilled tuna on top and mayonnaise mixed with 
    wasabi as a sauce. 
     
    Marinate cubes of feta or goat's cheese, brie or Camembert in basil, 
    garlic and lots of olive oil. Eat with sliced cucumbers as a snack. Or 
    sprinkle on a salad. Or have alongside a hamburger. Use as an omelette 
    filling with 1/4 of a chopped tomato. 
     
    Make a cabbage slaw and jazz it up with mint, cilantro, green onions 
    and a bit of lime juice. Put canned tuna or salmon and hardboiled eggs 
    on top.
