    Chapter 1.   Quick Tour 
    ------------------------ 
     
    Watch-Me!-Read is a reading practice tutor.  The diagnostics system 
    described in this documentation displays and summarized data collect 
    while students use Watch-Me!-Read (WMR).  In this section we will provide 
    a step-by-step set of instructions quickly outlining some basic features 
    of the diagnostics system. 
     
    The diagnostics are invoked by clicking on the "WMR Diagnostics" icon 
    on the desktop. 
     
     
     
     Short Desc & Contents 
     
    1) Watch Me Read is a reading practice tutor.  It uses an animated companion 
       (a panda)to guide the student though the reading of a book.  The system  
       uses speech recognition to listen to and assist the student a necessary. 
     
    -  Watch Me Read's Diagnostics displays data collect during these practice 
       sessions.  The diagnostics tool is described in this tutorial. 
     
    -  CONTENT 
       * The first minute describes a simple usage of the diagnostics 
       The remaining 5 minutes describe: 
       * All of the controls and display components found on the diagnostics screen 
       * Followed by a description of each screen type 
     
    2) A SIMPLE USAGE OF THE DIAGNOSTICS TOOL 
       * The tool is started ... 
       * Wait for the data to be loaded ... 
       * Then double click the ``Words'' report  
       > This screen lists all the words read by *** in their use of WMR 
       * The green bars ... 
       * The arrows at the top move us sequentally through all of the students 
       > Click home to return to the home screen 
       * Two screens are specifically designed for printing ... 
       * Exit 
     
    3) IN THIS SECTION WE DISCUSS THE CONTROLS AVAILABLE IN THE DIAG SYSTEM 
       * Top/left shows screen type... 
       * As saw before, current student name is shown here.Three ways to update.. 
       * The display at the top right shows the range of dates currently displayed 
         - We can specify a new range of dates to display 
         - This is particularly important for evals over extended periods of time.. 
         - Fully specifying dates is cumbersome so we have several short cuts 
           MM/DD, just one date, and w/d/m 
       * The first display on the second line allows the user to select a 
         specific set of words to display... 
       * The HOME button always just us direct back to the starting streen 
       * The LAST button move us to the last screen 
       * The print button causes the current screen to be printed. 
         - IMPT note.  Most displays are designed to fit nicely on your monitor. 
           they may not fit well on your printer.... 
     
       * Two optional buttons will appear if there are too many words to fit  
         on the display. 
     
    4) SCREEN TYPES 
       Different kinds of displays.  Each display is a different view on the  
       same student data.  You can view all the data simply using the first 
       ``WORDS'' default display.  On the other hand you can switch views at  
       anytime in order to better understand a particular student. 
       * WORDS           -- Default display 
       * TROUBLE WORDS   -- Sorted worst to best 
       * MASTERED WORDS  -- For completeness 
     
       More advanced screens 
       * Sparse data 
       * UNSPOKEN WORDS 
       * INCLUDE TOTALS 
       * VARIABLE WIDTHS 
     
       Printer screens 
       * PRINTER FORMATTED PAGE 
       * TEN TROUBLE WORDS 
     
       DEMO SCREENS 
       X Demos include because other screen types are possible, (& other word lsts) 
        
    5) TYPICAL USAGE 
       * Quick overview 
       * Ensuring all students are using system & using it correctly 
       * Practice word assigments 
       * Visualizing progress (using fixed word set) 
     
       WAYS it should NOT be used 
       * A number of factors not related to reading ability can impact 
         a students scores using this tool.  Proper system setup, dialect,  
         diversions on students attention, proper mic audio levels & mic placement 
         etc. 
       * We have worked hard to minimize ... and had good success ... 
       * Nonetheless these limitations must be kept in mind. 
       * Thus care needs to be taken in the disemination of this information. 
         We have included a printer display intended for presentation to  
         parents.  Note it is designed for student specific insruction but 
         does not invite direct comparison between students.  Makes good use of
