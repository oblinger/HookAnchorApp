    Diane & Tom, 
     
    Here is the next version of WMR Diagnostics, it is now call "At A Glance" 
    so the add/remove programs procedure should be used before installation 
    to remove the old program with different name and directory. 
     
    I am sending two CD roms just to make the installation process easier. 
    Let me know if there is any problems. 
     
    Thanks, 
    Dan
