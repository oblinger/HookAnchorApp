    MY QUESTIONS 
    - How do children ``login.''  How are seperate classes kept seperate on system. 
    - Shared disks, network (I assume, no.) 
     
    ASSUMPTIONS 
    - Large number of students rotate through a small number of computers 
      on a regular basis. 
    - Stats will be based on 5 - 25 book readings (or sittings) 
    - After initial setup children use system in an unattended fashion. 
     
    GOALS 
    Retrieval, Analysis, and Archiving of student performance information. 
    - Time efficient; variable-level  
    - Questions addressed by interface: 
      How is the class doing? 
      Who are the significant under/over performers. 
      Who are the under/over users. 
      How does performance vary across books, across 
    - Should show when data is less confident 
    - Scripted data retrieval. (Customizable?) 
    - Customizable subgroups?  class, reading group, at risk group 
     
    Display Types: 
    - Script menu 
    - Time Tick  
    - Functional graph 
     
     
    Measured Attributes: 
      Reading accuracy (first try) 
      Reading accuracy (in the limit) 
      Time spent on computer.  (ignore, non-response time?) 
       
     
    Derivative Attributes: 
      Time per week on system 
     
     
    Other Possibilities: 
      Response time. 
      Histogram of accuracy as a function of the retries.
