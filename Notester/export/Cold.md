# Cold --

    - COLD
    - FLU       -- Sudden onset
    - STREP     -- Only throat
    - BACTERIAL
    - SINUS INF -- Pressure/Greenish|Yellowish & Fever


    - LOCALIZATION -- localized=bacteria.    multiple=virus.   
      local = one size of throat more than other.  one ear, etc.
      (unless bacteria is a secondary infection)

    - Color of Discharge:  clear=viral.  yellow/green=bacterial.

    - FEVER:  none=viral.   lowGrade=bacterial (or flu)

    - TIME:  

    - DISCHARGE COLOR:  Clear/Thin=Viral.   Yellow/Green=Bacterial.  
      But most Green is viral.
      Viral can become thick and green at end.

    - THROAT

    ==========

    - OTHERS:  virus is airborne so others will have it too.  alone=bacterial
    - THROAT:  White spots = bacterial




    ==========
    LOCALIZATION

    Bacterial throat pain is often characterized by more pain on one side of the throat. An ear infection is more likely to be bacterial if the pain occurs in only one ear



    ==========
    STREP

    - Focused on throat, not other symptoms.  Very painful (even to swallow)
    - LYMPH NODES -- Tender to the touch = STREP

    ==========
    Generally, when a person has a virus, more than one part of the body is affected ... sore throat, runny nose, headache, hoasreness, cough, cold symptoms, sneezing, fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The person won't usually have all of these at once, but a few of them.

    When a person has a bacterial infection, it usually only affects one part of the body ... If you have an only an ear ache and fever it is probably bacterial. If you have just a sore throat and fever, it is probably bacterial.

    Sometimes, a person starts with a virus, but then gets a bacterial infection too. Signs of this are usually multiple symptoms for a few days, but then they suddenly get much worse. Or they have been improving, and get worse again.

    Also, just a red throat ... probably viral, but white patches on the tonsils ... bacterial. Yellow mucous ... viral, green mucous...bacterial. A high fever(102) for only 1 or 2 days ... viral, a high fever for more than 2 days ... bacterial. A low fever (100) for up to

    ADVICE

    Thank you for calling our Kaiser Permanente Call Center about your cold or flu symptoms. As we discussed, here is more information and advice about your cold and flu symptoms.
    For practical and timely information from your physician about cold, flu and cough, please see our Cold and Flu site at <<>> 
    Common colds and the flu usually last about 1 to 2 weeks. Antibiotics do not work for colds or flu, which are caused by viruses. Antibiotics only kill bacteria, but there several things you can do to feel better.
    - Plan to get some extra rest if you feel tired.
    - Drink adequate liquids unless your physician has restricted your fluids for medical reasons.

    For specific symptom relief, follow the package directions for these over the counter (OTC) medications:
    - Fever - take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)
    - Coughing - take dextromethorphan and guaifenesin (Robitussin DM, Mucinex DM)
    - Sneezing, runny nose - take non-drowsy antihistamines such as fexofenadine (Allegra), cetirizine (Zyrtec), or loratidine (Claritin)
