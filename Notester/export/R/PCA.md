    GOAL:  Seeks basis for data that accounts for the varience in the data.  It: 
           (1) minimizes coorelation between dimensions 
           (2) Orders dimensions so that first dimensions account for greatest amt  
               of varience. 
    COMPUTE:The eigenvectors of the covarience matrix
