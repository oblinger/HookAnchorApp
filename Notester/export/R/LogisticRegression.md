    LOGISTIC REGRESSION -- Like linear regression except we are finding 
    parameters for a logistic curve rather than a parameters of a line. 
    LogisticCurve:  P = exp(b0+b1*X)<<>>(1+exp(b0+b1*X)) 
    LogisticFunction = LogOdds = loge(p/(1-p)) = b0+b1*X 
    Idea: match curve expected from binary variable???
