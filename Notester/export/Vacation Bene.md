# Vacation Bene --

    ?



    Sick Leave - no limit; balance carries over from year to year.

    Annual Leave - can only carry over 240 hours from year to year -- anything over that amout must be used or will be lost at the end of the leave year.

    What the below means is that if you use no more than 80 hours of annual leave between now and 2 Jan 2010, you will start the new year leave year with your 240 carryover.  So therefore any annual leave you earn next year, which will be 208 hours, will need to be used or lost come the end of the leave year in January 2011.
