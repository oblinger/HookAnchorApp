# Sh.While --

        while list do list done 
              A while command repeatedly executes the while list and, 
              if  the  exit status of the last command in the list is 
              zero, executes the do list;  otherwise  the  loop  ter- 
              minates.   If  no commands in the do list are executed, 
              then the while command  returns  a  zero  exit  status; 
              until  may be used in place of while to negate the loop 
              termination test.
