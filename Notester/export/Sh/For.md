# Sh.For --

         for name [ in word ... ] do list done 
              Each time a for command is executed, name is set to the 
              next  word taken from the in word list.  If in word ... 
              is omitted, then the for command executes the  do  list 
              once  for  each  positional  parameter that is set (see 
              ``Parameter  Substitution,''  below).   Execution  ends 
              when there are no more words in the list.
