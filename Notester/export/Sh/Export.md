# Sh.Export --

         export [ name ... ] 
              The given names are marked for automatic export to  the 
              environment  of  subsequently executed commands.  If no 
              arguments are given,  variable  names  that  have  been 
              marked  for export during the current shell's execution 
              are listed.  (Variable names  exported  from  a  parent 
              shell  are listed only if they have been exported again 
              during the current shell's execution.)  Function  names 
              are not exported.
