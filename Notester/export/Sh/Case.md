# Sh.Case --

        case word in [ pattern [                                   | 
               pattern ] ... ) list ;; ] ... esac 
              A case command executes the list  associated  with  the 
              first  pattern that matches word.  The form of the pat- 
              terns is the same as that used for file-name generation 
              (see  ``File  Name Generation'') except that a slash, a 
              leading dot, or a dot  immediately  following  a  slash 
              need not be matched explicitly.
