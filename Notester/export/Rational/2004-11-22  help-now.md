# Rational.2004-11-22 help-now --

    The compelling value proposition is call avoidance/cost reduction for support centers
    Provide marketing differentiator for HelpNow

    Support is split into three groups:
        How to: Knowledge documents
        Administrative: Call Center
        Break/Fix: Call Center, possibly Deskside Support

    IBM Project Office analyzes HelpNow data
    Use EClassifier against ESM DB to categorize subject matter.
    Identifies ~Top 10 Questions/Top Ticket Drivers and then they develop Knowledge documents in response

    The helpdesk has used support.com and switched to CTLF1.com for ?

    Strategic issues: How to get the application on the machine/in the base (convert to applet?, get PC Division to include in standard build, get ITS? to include in standard configuration)...

    Gavin Cameron, Greenock Labs
