    <<>>

    SOFTWARE GROUP PEOPLE DOING ECLIPSE GUI STUFF  (thru julian jones)


    (1) OBTAINING SCENERIOS
      <<>>           Obtain Red/Green threads from Allan
                           X DAN: contact Adam about green thread codification
      <<>>       ! You should contact Julian Jones to discuss "green threads"... Julian's effort to simplify use cases...product integrations.

      CHEAT SHEETS           <<>>   "Clear case managers"

    (2) BUILDING ON THEIR INSTRUMENTATION  (RFT APIs)
      <<>>          Manager of RFT group
      <<>>           ! Owes us an API, and a contact person.
                           
    (3) CUSTOMER CUSTOMIZATION  --  Idea:  Deliver rational procduct that allows customers to develop documentation for rational products
                           o <<>> to discuss site specific customization.

    (4) REFACTORING -- Idea:  Support simultaneous test script updating as underlying GUI changes
      <<>>         ! Can we support refactoring updating of many test scripts?  (Serge Lucio)

    (5) UEVAL SUPPORT -- Idea:  Support unassisted user install and demo of rational products
      <<>>              - Participate in unassisted evaluation beta in December
      In Roads             - Connect with In Roads team regarding their beta

    OTHER THREADS
      Grady                  Under the hood presentation    (Waiting on Grady)
                             Vit: Stephanie contact on internal training
                             Jackie DeVries
                           x Discussion with Grant Larson
                           x Jazz collaboration   "Present PW as an avatar in that space"



    ----- MEETING WITH GRADY BOOCH
    (1) Grant Larson -- Rational Software Architect  (Solution Guide)
        Obtain information about RSA and Solution Guide from Grant Larson, and
        discuss possible intersections with Personal Wizards technology.

    (2) Serge Lucio -- Rational Function Tester
        Obtain information about Ratonal Tester, and look specificially at how
        this technoloy can be coupled with the PW technology, and how the 
        scripts generated by PW might be integrated.

    (3) Allen Tate -- Rational Help Documentation
        Understand Rational's current toolset for documentation generation, and
        discuss possible synergies with PW.

    (4) Mark Wegman -- "Under the hood" discussion of the PW technology.
        Coordination a follow on meeting where the PW team takes a first 
        pass at describing the underlying algorithms, the PW architecture,
        and experinece with this technology


    ------- MEETING SERGE LUCIO
    (1) Bob will send us a link to the current beta of the Rational Functional
        Tester, and we will investigate the coverage of this tool on both the 
        eclipse and windows platform.
        The aim of this effort is to understand the issues in using the 
        instrumentation and execution support of that product to drive our 
        personal wizards system.

    (2) We will consider how our current technology can be used to support
        refactoring and/or parallel updating of many test scripts. 
        The aim of this effort is to support simultaneous updates to many test
        scripts when the underlying application is updated.

    (3) We will also look at the rational functional tester to see if our ability
        to record test script based on multiple demonstrations would add value 
        to the tool as it exists now.


    ------- MEETING WITH ALLAN TATE 
    (1) We will participate in the Unassisted Evaluation Beta in 
        November, and will consider if and how easily our technology
        could be used to provide similar functionality.

    (2) Allan will send us red and green thread scenarios that we can use
        as examples of the kinds of procedures that Rational is interested in capturing.

    (3) One application for PW would be a customer tool for generating
        training materials for usage of Rational specific to their organization.
        Allan will try to find where such a tool might fit into the Rational organization.

    (4) Vittorio will contact Stephanie about the training done internally within Rational.
        This may provide us with examples of procedures relevant to Rational, and let us
        see the tools currently used for training.

    (5) Dan will contact Adam regarding the codification of green threads.
        (Was there another person I was also supposed to contact about the codification of green threads?)
