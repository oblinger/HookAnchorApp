    -----------------

    Functional tester 

     - automating functional tests
     - record series of interactions, play them back, embed a series of things you want to test

     
    Possible uses:

      - automatic generation of new tests
      - automatic refactoring
          - common subroutines
               - how scalable would this be?
               - can the tool offer suggestions based on context?
                        . currently use a common map for multiple traces

      - make change in a single place when UI has changed, find other places that need to be changed in existing scripts.

      - each conditional is a separate test script - this is desirable.
