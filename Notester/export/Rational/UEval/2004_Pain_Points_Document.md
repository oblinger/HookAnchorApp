    "Dan,

    I just cc'd you on a note to Mike Donati regarding use of ClearCase for 
    Research.  Also, you were interested in our 2004 "pain points" -- attached is 
    that document.  Regarding the idea of having UEVAL join forces with the UCM 
    tutorial folks, we have a meeting scheduled for this Thursday.  Let me know if 
    there are other actions for which I was supposed to follow-up from our last 
    meeting.

    Regards,

    Allan

    Allan,

    We are beginning to look into Module 3 of the UEVAL process.  
    It seems useful for us to obtain a copy of the CCRC even if we
    don't have a server to connect it to.  
    Does that make sense?  Will we be able to get some functionality out of it, 
    even while not connected to the server?
    It may also gain us access to the related documentation.


    You also said I should get in contact with Mike "denade" regarding access to a 
    clear case server.
    Could you forward his notes address?  I understand he will be busy helping 
    others to gain
    access as well, so I know we may expect it will be some time before he has 
    bandwidth to
    help us move our project over from CVS.

    Just enough configured to allow the client to execute, should be our first goal.
    Let me know if you have constraints on how this should be prioritized.

    Thanks,
    Dan
