    I think the person you want to talk with is Chris Reckling. I think he could give you the broader picture of what they are trying to do to make Workplace applications easier to build, including Workplace Designer and some pointers to people to talk to before pitching to Rhodin. I couldn't track down the woman who gave
    the Workplace Desginer demo that I saw (sorry) but she probably works in that group.
