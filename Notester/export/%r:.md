    PIMCO Foreign Bond (Unhedged) (PFUIX) and T. Rowe Price International Bond (RPIBX) are two of our favorite unhedged funds. The PIMCO fund benefits from the firm's vast research capabilities as well as management's risk-averse stance. T. Rowe Price International Bond is somewhat more adventurous as it is willing to go further afield into areas such as emerging markets, but management is experienced and price-conscious. The truly adventurous might also look at Templeton Global Bond A (TPINX). Management will make significant direct currency bets, including those on especially volatile emerging-markets currencies.
