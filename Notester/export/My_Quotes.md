    ON PATENTS:

    Such precious intellectual property is nothing less than our generation's bequeath to future generations.

    When our generation is gone.  Death, taxes, war, and body odor will still plague human kind.
    But all is not lost, the patent office has captured at least one gleaming nugget to pass on to future generations.

    All generations from this one down through time can avoid polluting our visual landscape by covering those
    cue ball heads using a simple three step procedure.

    And this is nugget is but one spec perched on the top of a colossal mountain of effluent flowing steadily into and out of the patent office.

    Get your shovel boys, we have work to do!

    By the way, this is in no way intended to cast doubts on your work.  :-)
