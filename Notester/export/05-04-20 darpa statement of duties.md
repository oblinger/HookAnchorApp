    Program Manager
    Statement of Duties

        The DARPA Program Manager for the Information Processing Technology Office will provide technical and managerial oversight of a program to develop learning technologies to support soldiers in the field.  These computer capabilities will provide a tool that will integrate learning, reasoning, and acquisition techniques into intergrated learning software that can be applied to a wide variety of DOD problems.  The core technologies developed under this effort will provide top-level prioritization and control, new base representations for strategy, and bias and domain knowledge.  These technologies involve new methods of optimization and instantiation, knowledge acquisition, and behavior mimicking methods.  One of the key challenges for the new architecture is to develop learning technologies that simultaneously employ constraints from different input modalities into a system that can boot strap itself repeatedly in order to solve a ladder of tasks with increasing complexity.

    The Program Manager also serves as the focal point for direction of a broad range of research efforts using adaptive cognitive techniques in the above areas and coordinates these efforts with other components of the DoD.  A DoD challenge problem will be identified to test the methodologies and demonstrate the application and capabilities for bootstrap learning for use by troops prior to deployment in the field.
