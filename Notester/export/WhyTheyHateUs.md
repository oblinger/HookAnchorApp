# WhyTheyHateUs --


    Why they hate us?

    The peoples of Turkey, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia are deeply set against a war with Iraq.
    In addition to its people's ire, the Turkish government has much to loose in a war that 
    loosen Saddam's grip on his Kurds, since Turkey is also using violence to control their Kurds.

    Dispite these strong incentives not to go to war, each of these governments has decared that 
    they will support this war on Iraq even before some Western countries have done so.

    The Arabic population strongly believes a war against Iraq is a 
    war of is brother against brother, it is unjust, and they believe it is not in their interest.  

    Imagine the gnawing anger we would feel toward a country that could cause us to participate 
    in a war against our own brothers, a war that we did not believe in, and a war that
    we believed was not in our interest.  America could not contain its rage!  Our young and
    old alike would bravely sacrifice their lives tp remove this perceived yolk of oppression.

    Come on America!  It is not our way of life, or our wealth they hate, it is the amazingly
    potent control we have.


    -------
    But we must use this potent control if we want to catch the terrorists right?

    Arab peoples must feel they are collaborating with us to catch an prosecute terrorists criminals.

    Instead, if in our haste we make them feel forced to do things in our 
    interest at the expense of their own; if they feel we 
    afford their citizen's fewer rights than we afford our own, they will hate us with a 
    rightious hate that will create ten new terrorists for each one stop.



    Musilim.
