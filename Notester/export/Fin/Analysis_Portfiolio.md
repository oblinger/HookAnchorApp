    GOALS:
     * Rebalance portfolio holdings
     * Check to see if I have any dogs in the mix
     * Think about what else I should be doing

    QUESTIONS:
    - What percentages do I have in each category?
    - What is the morning star rating for each investment?
    - Is there and shifting I should be doing?
    - Are there any goals I should be considering?
