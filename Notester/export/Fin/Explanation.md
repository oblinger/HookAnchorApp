       ===  SPREADSHEET ANALYSIS  === 
       ============================== 
     
    STUB -- Breakdown of gross pay based on my pay stub 
    - Assumes 2 pay period per month 
     
    VIRTUAL INCOME -- Monetary benefits that do not generate explicit cash flow 
    - E.g. Matching 401K money 
     
    CASH FLOW -- Actual transactions as cash flow 
    - Based on Quicken Budget Report. 
    - All Categories are partitioned into Groups  
      (Type Control-C to see them, or planning:budget) 
    - The big equation:  Inflow - Outflow = Change in Net Worth 
      INFLOW: income + OffBudget(virtualized) 
      OUTFLOW: expenses 
      BOTTOM-LINE: Change in Total Net Worth 
    - EXCLUDE: 
      * Schwab/Investment/Interest 
      * Exclude IBM stocks sales or variable pay 
      * Exclude Loans I give to others 
     
    VIRTUAL NET WORTH 
     
    SUMMARY 
     
    BUDGET FLOW ANALYSIS -- What is my local derivative? Where is it going? 
    - include virtual income&expenses???? 
    - Replaces big 1 time transactions with virtual flows 
      So both IBM stock selling and bonus are excluded and included as virtal pay 
    - Flows to and from Investments and loans are excluded since they do not 
      affect net worth derivative or budget 
    - Two pies with same total size virtual inflow/outflow 
      Savings or loss slice moves between pies depending on directon of flow 
     
     

    CATEGORIES
    All expenses are partitioned into categories.  (Quicken Cntrl-C)   Categories are groups as follows
        D=discretionary or M=mandatory;   S=sporadic  or  F=fixed 
        * VERIFY that Fixed (D and M) are worth the money, and are budgeted correctly.
        * VERIFY that zero is zero
        * IGNORE M-Sporadic because there is no choice anyway      
        * FOCUS  sporadic-discretionay  (Daily & Durables)           ??? do we need Discrtionary-Fixed ??
