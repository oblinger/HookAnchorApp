    Daniel,

    Welcome to Ballston Sport & Health Club! We have many exciting programs that will add variety to your workouts.

    Our next session of Boot Camp started this week and will run October 28-December 11, meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6:30-7:30am. This is a no-nonsense workout that combines athletic-based cardiovascular exercises and strength training.
    If you're looking for results, then Boot Camp is the place for you! It's not too late to sign up, and we offer flexible options for how many sessions you attend. Registration forms are in the club.

    If you're trying to improve your core strength and add balance and flexibility to your workouts, you should consider Pilates reformer training. We have many opportunities for both private and small group sessions. You can find more details about this online at: <<>> sportandhealth.com/Ballston/Pilates


    If you enjoy a dance-based workout, you'll love Cardio Samba Fusion. This program meets on Wednesdays at 7:30-8:30pm. It's a blend of Latin dance steps used to choreograph fitness routines anyone can do. If you're interested, you can sign up online at:
    dance.meetup.com/540. The first class is always free!

    Please contact me if you have questions or need more information.

    Best regards,

    Linda
