    Ida Mae passed away and Bubba called 911. The
    911-operator told Bubba that she would send someone out right away.
    "Where do you live?" asked the operator.
    Bubba replied, "At the end of Eucalyptus Drive.
    " The operator asked, "Can you spell that for me?"
    After a long pause, Bubba said, "How 'bout I drag her over to Oak Street and you pick her up there?"
