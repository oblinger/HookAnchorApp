    "Dear Dr. Oblinger,

    I am Prof. Yehea Ismail's fourth year graduate student at Northwestern
    University. I will be graduating in June 2005 as we discussed today. I am
    attaching a copy of my latest resume (in pdf and word formats) with this email.

    My research topics include VLSI CAD algorithms related to timing
    analysis. I have also worked on developing timing models for complex
    circuits (linear and nonlinear) and studying the effects of process
    variations on timing and power.

    Please let me know if you would like to know specific details about my
    research. Thank you.

    Sincerely,
    Chirayu Amin
