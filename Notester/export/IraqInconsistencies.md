# IraqInconsistencies --

    Mark, Ya-shin, and Minjoo,


    So I bundled up and braved the bitter cold to participate in my first 
    peace rally.  It was alot of fun, people had very inventive signs, and
    there was an energy unlike the more typical American apathy about things.

    It felt good to *do* something about this impending calamity, even though
    being one out of 100,000 doesn't make much different in any practical sense,
    it feels good.  I applauded a very well done color poster of George Bush
    with the words "AL Qaeda Recruiter of the Year" emblazed upon it.  The owner was 
    frozen solid so he let me carry the torch from then on.  Many people and even
    someone from a French news paper grabed my photo with it.  Yoshiko came out
    for a bit, and Sabine stayed with me till the end.



    Flush with a sense of purpose, but aware that being a warm body
    on a street doesn't really have much made me think about alternatives.
    I should use my head or at least my mouth rather than my body.
    Perhaps I could try to get a carefully articulated 
    letter into various newspapers.  If this succeeded it would
    have a much greater (though still very, very tiny) impact.

    My goal in the following letter is to attack the primary arguments
    used to support the war using only facts that most Americans accept as true.
    Tell me how to improve this, or if you can think
    of a more compelling arguments, tell me those....

    My goal was be concise enough that the inconsistancies jump out at the
    reader during a light skim, but I also have too many points to make.
    Do any of you have a clue about sending a letter to an editor?
    What does it take to get in?  How should I proceed?

    Are my points too contorted with info?


    Thanks for the help,
    Dan


    P.S. Mark if you think your Dad and/or sisters might enjoy reading
    this please forward.





    The Letter
    ----------

    Our ability to accept arguments with obvious contradictions is impressive.

    Consider: We claim to oppose Saddam because of his gassing of Iranians in 1983, and
    his own people in 1988.  If that were truly the reason for our action, why
    did we militarily support Iraq during those years.  Further, we support Turkey today, 
    though we acknowledge it has burned the villages of an estimated three million of its own citizens.

    Consider: We claim prosecuting this war will help Iraq's neighbors, as well as all 
    the people of the world.  But this is a disingenuous claim, when the very neighbors being "helped" 
    and most people world are opposed to our action.

    Consider: We claim that we must remove Saddam before he gives weapons to terrorists.
    Throughout his political career Saddam has ruthlessly sought to increase his personal power.
    Attacking Iran, the Kurds, and Kuwait all aimed at increasing his power; giving
    terrorists weapons to attack the US, on the other hand, would not increase his power--it would very likely 
    decrease it.  Saddam did not give such weapons during the past twelve years of
    US bombings and sanctions because it would Saddam, as it will hurt him now.

    In summary, we are attacking a country for crimes it committed while we were supported it, to "help"
    a world that is saying "wait", in order to prevent Saddam from a taking self-defeating 
    action that he has not taken in the past twelve years.

    The reason we want to remove Saddam is simple: we cannot control him.  
    In contrast, when the bombs start dropping Turkey, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia 
    (though deeply opposed to the war) will do as they are told.

    Just imagine some country with enough influence over *our* government to cause us 
    to participate in a war that we did not believe in.  Perhaps it is this control,
    and not our wealth that infuriates the Arab world so.

    Notes:

    - If this note needs to be shortened.  The second paragraph beginning "Consider" could be
      removed.  The paragraph beginning "In Summary" could also be removed.

    - The last paragraph is a strong point most Americans cannot imagine why we are hated, so
      I hate to remove it, but it is really an
      add on.  Should it be removed or changed?

    - The 3 million internally displayed within Turkey is taken from an Amnesty International article

    - The gassing dates of 1983 and 1988 are found in a number of sources including a recent
      BBC on-line summary:
