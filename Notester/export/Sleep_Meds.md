    - Ambien -- zolpidem
    - Get knockedout in 10/20 mins, ask for Lormetazepam
    - Legally, the most potent sleeping pill for humans is Halcion- dosages start at 0.125mg (It is a benzodiazepine like Valium or Restoril,



    SAFER:   [tamazapam temtabs] zopiclone zolpidem halcion.



    LIST:  Ambien, Lunesta, Restoril, Trazadone,Xanax, Clonopin,  [Ativan]  <-- try
     benzos are great for short term,if I need some sleep and need it now the winner of that one is the 30 mg Restoril 
    For long term use that works and is subtle Trazadone 100mg.

    Replaces Barbituates

    Benzodiazepines:   (safer but still strong)
    ProSom (estazolam) 
    Dalmane (flurazepam) 
    Restoril (temazepam) 
    Halcion (triazolam) 


    =================
    The normally the best medications are temazepam, zolpidem, zopiclone, and eszopiclone. These drugs are all highly effective and they cause 
    little or no disturbance of sleep architecture (brain waves as you sleep). I typically recommend temazepam, for most people between either 
    15, 20, or 30 mg is best. 

    Halcion (triazolam) is typically considered the "strongest and most powerful." It is HIGHLY potent and available in two dose strengths, 0.125 
    and 0.25 mg. The maximum dose is 0.5 mg. So it is a very potent drug but it is best to only use it short term (7-10 days) and it is best to try 
    other hypnotics before using Halcion. 



    Stilnox
    =======
    The drug that I forgot earlier was Xanax(alprazolam)
    it is one kind of benzodiazepines(BZD)
    BZD have multiple effects of sedation, sleeping induction, anti-anxiety, anti-convulsion, and muscle relaxation, 
    BZD are broad groups, some are good in sedation, some are good for anti-anxiety...., so BZD should be used for individual need. 
    I think you did some homework for these drugs, so I can give you some experience from me and my colleague.
    for rapid onset and short~intermediate~long duration BZD:
      Halcion (triazolam):onset can be 15~40 mins, it also can be good for anti-anxiety(like if you are going to have a presentation or surgery next day and you can't sleep), but it is a pregnancy category X drug, not good for going to be pregnant or fetus, so if you guys plan to have a baby, you probably not take it. 
      Xanax (alprazolam):onset can be 20~40 mins, duration 2~6 hrs, it is also good in anti-anxiety, like Halcion, but it make less dizzy when you wakeup, my colleague recommend it if you choose one kind of BZD.
      Rivotril, Klonopin (clonazepam): slow onset and long action, it is more commonly used for anti-panic, seizure..., and it takes more time to taper off drug.
      Ativan (lorazepam): slow onset and long duration, more often used for anti-panic....like Klonopin.

    Besided BZD, there are non-BZD drugs for insomnia, like Stilnox(zoplidem) I mentioned in airplane.
      Stilnox, onset is quick, it doesn't have other effect like anti-anxiety or muscle relaxation..., more simply induce you to sleep. It is probably most commonly used non-BZD sleeping pills in Taiwan. This drug works well for my family, if only take less then 20mg(2 pills) for short term use, there won't be addiction. After long term daily use, some people may tolerate it, like you take 0.5# initially for months then you need 1# for the same effect.
    Also there are similar drugs in the same group: Imovane (zopiclone) and Sonata (zaleplon), these are not available in Taiwan, I only know their action duration are different, otherwise I am not clear.

    There is a new drug Ramelteon, similar to melatonin, it works on different receptors so it is more effective and not addictive comparing to melatonin. Maybe you can try this alone or combine with other drug.

    My colleague give me her insomnia suggestion:
      If you are nervous about sometime and that's why you can't sleep: Xanax may help
      If just for jetlag: first 3 days(1~3 day): take 1# Stilnox + Melatonin
                              2nd 3 days(4~6 day): 0.5# Stilnox + Melatonin
                              later (7~day): Melatonin only
      If you worry about the dosage or your jetlag is not bad, start with 0.5# Stilnox is fine.

    SLEEP MEDICINE
    Ambien, Lunesta, Restoril, Trazadone,Xanax, Clonopin,Ativan
    -- Midazolam
    -- 30 mg Restoril

    Internet programs are likely to be cheaper than most therapists, too. I downloaded a five-week course called Conquering Insomnia for $40. Another online C.B.T. program called SHUTi charges $135 for 16 weeks of access to a program, which includes a series of six sessions and follow-up for 10 weeks. Both programs provide individualized feedback on your weekly sleep logs.
