# OAV --

    The purpose of the Organic Air Vehicle (OAV) program is to provide ground combat units, including Future
    Combat Systems unit cells, with a capability to detect adversary troops concealed in forests or behind buildings or
    hills, i.e., anywhere that U.S. forces do not have a direct line-of-sight to the hostile force. Today the military must
    send out human scouts to locate and identify enemy troops, a slow and dangerous process. The air vehicle will be
    small, lightweight, and inexpensive enough to be carried, launched, and operated by lower-echelon ground units.
    The goal is an OAV design that is scalable between nine inches and three feet in diameter, weigh between two and
    10 kilograms, and cost approximately $10,000 each in quantities of 100,000 or more (cost for the air vehicle without
    payloads). The air vehicle will carry a variety of sensors, such as light detection and ranging, infrared, or electrooptic
    devices to detect vehicles or individual soldiers. Initial testing of an OAV candidate, the lift augmented ducted
    fan vehicle, was completed satisfactorily last year. In FY 2001, flight control software was developed and
    autonomous flight tests were performed numerous times. In FY 2002 and FY 2003, Honeywell will continue
    23
    development of the flight control software to allow for flight in adverse weather. Flights tests are scheduled
    throughout FY 2002, and the autonomous OAV will be ready for evaluation by FCS in April 2003.
