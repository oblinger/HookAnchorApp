# Docs.Action Flows --


    All Notester flows are designed to make the action flows instant and effortless.
    Questions like "what should I work on now?"  "what can I do in the 5 minutes before my meeting?"
    and "holy crap am I behind, what must absolutely get done today?" are only a glance away.

    ## MUST OCCUR ##
    >  REFLEX FLOW     -- (1  second)   Occurs each time you view the start screen.
    >  DAILY FLOW      -- (2  minutes)  Occurs at the start of each day.  
    >  WEEKLY FLOW     -- (10 minutes)  Occurs weekly.

    ## MAY OCCUR ##
    >  OCCASIONAL FLOW -- (variable)    Occurs during down times.
    >  PLANNING FLOW   -- (variable)    Occurs on some weeks.

    WEEKLY FLOW -- This is a very important flow!  Notester provides dozen's of nooks and crannies 
    for putting items that you are not working on right now.  If you allow yourself to get 
    "too busy" to spend 5-15 minutes freshing these lists and promoting items as they become urgent.
    The whole system will fail.  THE FIRST THING EACH WEEK DO THE WEEKLY FLOW.

    (1) ADD     Scan PRIME and OPPORTUNE lists in detail to see if items need to be promoted to the 
                WEEK or TODO lists.
    (2) SCRAPE  Scan all lists and push less important items off the list, or into a lower group
                on the list.  Each list should have the most important items in the top five
                since these will be the ones you are conscious of during the week.
                Keep your lists brief.  If you will not get to it in the timeframe for that list
                then get it off that list!
    (3) ORG     Organize the WEEK into three groups (1) what expect/must get done this week,
                (2) what you want/may get done,  (3) stuff pushed to next week.

    The groups listed above are simply sets of items one a list separated by a blank line.  Thus
    the week list will have:  stuff this week, blank line, maybe this week, blank line, next week stuff.
    See <<>> for group manipulation commands.

    <<>>
    DAILY FLOW -- Each morning spend 2 minutes planning you day, by organizing the top of the TODO
    and WEEK lists.  The top group should only contain items that you truly believe you can accomplish
    during the day.  Thus the TODO and WEEK lists get an additional group at the top representing what
    you plan to do today.  As the day wears on you can manipulate these top portions to reflect changing
    conditions.  

    <<>>
    REFLEX FLOW -- The organization of all lists, of the start screen itself and minutes
    spent in the Weekly&Daily flows are all designed around this reflex flow.  Never dropping the
    ball and always working on most important activities is as easy as looking at the start screen.

    The reflex flow is simply the way you look at the Notester start screen.
    The most time sensitive time lists are arranged from left to right on the top half of
    the notester screen.  Items are pulled from the lists and executed.  Generally only the
    top item or two on each list are even considered in this glance.  Other flows have ensured
    that those items will always be most important items.

    Because this flow is so important, we describe it here in (painful?) detail.  Execution of the
    reflex flow -- it will quickly become second nature:

    -- USUALLY EMPTY --
     *  If any items are in FIRST they should be executed if possible.  If their priority drops
        them move them back down to the TODO list.  List should generally be empty so you eyes
        do not get used to skipping over such items.
     *  Process items in the INBOX next.  This can be done in place if there are few or they are quick.
        They can be quickly pushed to the TODO list by typing the "TT" (THROW TODO) command.

    -- EXECUTE AN ACTIVITY --
     *  Top part of TODO list and top part of WEEK lists contain current most important activities.
        Choose an activity and do it.  Use 'X' command to remove completed item.

    -- MOVE AN ACTIVITY --
     *  If you find you are skipping over items them move them down or off the list.  Dont
        worry about the bottoms of the lists, but make sure the top few items really represent 
        your priorities at this moment in the day.  Most movement commands are just two keystrokes
        so you can push an item as fast as you can conceive of where to push it.

        FIRST -> TODO        (if item is no longer first)
        INBOX -> TODO        (if not done now)
        TODO  -> OPPORTUNE   (if item would NOT fail if done next week)
        TODO  -> GROUP 2     (if item may not happen today, but should happen this week)
        WEEK  -> GROUP 2     (if item wont happen today)

        The "M2" will move an item to the second group within a list
        The "T*" command will throw an item to another list.
        See <<>> for details about list gymnastics.

    OCCASIONAL FLOW

    Notester's lists are designed to let you get stuff out of face when you cannot or will not work on
    it.  In order to ensure these nooks and crannies do not simply become a graveyard of
    important but less time critical items it is important to attend to these lists when time permits.

     *  Occasionally duing the day or week, you can look at the PRIME list to jog your thinking 
        about these Primary activities.  Ask youself the question:  "Has anything changed during this
        week which requires an immediate response.  If so, add item to TODO or WEEK listl
     *  You must find occasional down time to look at the OPPORTUNE list.  This list is a great 
        relief valve for crunch times, but only if you use non-cruch times to attend to the list.
        Otherwise it becomes a graveyard for type II (important but non-time critical items) --
        Seven Habits argues this category is ignored by most people. 
        - Consider adding a weekly todo item like:  120 minutes of OPPORUNE list.
        - Consider pushing items back upto the Todo list when they become more critical
        - Consider pushing items to KILLER list if they cannot be 


    <<>>
    PLANNING FLOW -- Because the weekly flow is so critical it has been broken into one part that must
    occur each week and a second group of activities that should occur when convenient, but at
    least every month or so.

    B-LIST -- Top of B-list should be organized and items pushed to the quarterly list as needed.
    QUARTERLY -- Scan items to see if any inspire you to action, if so upgrade to TODO or OPPORTUNE

    Spend time on ROLES and GOALS lists.  Commit to items for next week(s) by adding items to TODO/WEEK
