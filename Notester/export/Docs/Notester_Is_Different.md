    NOTESTER IS DIFFERENT!  HERE ARE THE CORE IDEAS:

    (1)  If you can't see it, you will forget it.
         --> So we structure *all* you need to see on one screen.

    (2)  If what you see, is not what you need *now*, you won't look at it.
         --> So we have 3 or 4 screens for your three or four primary contexts (e.g. at work, at home)

    (2)  If you have to think about it, you won't do it.
         --> So we trimmed down every keystroke and every mental decision needed when entering information.

    (3)  If there are more than a few items you won't read it.
         --> So we continuously re-organize stale info away from your main view.

    (4)  If it isn't the easiest path FOR YOUR CURRENT GOAL, you won't do it.
         --> So we provide a variety of input methods which allow entering info WITHOUT
             having to decide how and what to do with 

    (5)  If you don't continuously check your lists, you wont trust or use your lists.
         If you can't check your lists in seconds you wont check them.
        --> So we develop a scan path for you eyes to follow 

    (6)  Fractions of a seconds count.  You wont get most value from notester if you
         dont use it most of the time, and you wont use it most of the time if it 
         is not instant.
         --> We provide keyboard based shortcuts for all commands, and
             optimize frequent commands so that visual feedback is not required.

    (7)  You wont put the thousands of items of info in your life into it, if it is not
         the most convenient way to file it and find that info later.
         --> So we use tree-based indexing, indexing by name, multi-axis searching,
             and project-centric organization, to facilatate flexible storage/retrieval of
             very large very amounts of unstructured data

    (8)  If your too busy to write it when you think of it, you wont remember it when
         you do have time to write it.
         --> Many features were designed assuming that information is being absorbed 
             while you are engaged in other activities (e.g. presenting at a meeting)

    A bit of advice:  Ease into notester.  Start using it *all* *the* *time* but for a few
    simpler tasks.  Once you find value, and are comfortable, then increase the
    set of things you use it for.
