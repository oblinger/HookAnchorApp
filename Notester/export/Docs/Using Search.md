# Docs.Using Search --


    Ok, so now that you have put it into Notester, how do you get it back out?
    There are a number of ways depending on how it was stored and what you remember about it.
    The following list of options roughly flow from the easiest to the most sophisticated retrieval methods.

    BY-NAME:  If you know the name (or prefix) of a Notester Note's name, then use the TAB-G (Goto) command 
    to go to the named note.

    BY-PROJECT: If you know the name of the project, then you can goto that project note, and
    click on the appropriate child note in the children list under the word "NOTESTER"
    If the item is a journal, meeting, actvity, etc.  Then you must click on the line summarizing the
    appropriate group.  For example, click on the line '--- 23 Journal Items ---' to see a list of
    all journal entries for that project.

    BY-SEARCH:  The TAB-S command brings up a menu of specialized searches.  The ALL search will search
    'all' notes by default.  It will display a reverse chronological list of all Notester entries.
    The fields at the top of the screen allow specialization of the search.  They are briefly described:
      "   "     --  Only show items containing the exact text (not case sensitive)
      Under     --  Only show items UNDER specified entry
      Depth     --  Only show items at most 'n' levels "under" the under entry
      Named     --  Only show items having the specified shortname
      Type      --  Only show items of specified TYPE
      After     --  Only show items edited AFTER specified number of days ago
      'P'       --  Only show PROJECTS only
      'T'       --  Only show TODO list items
      'H'       --  Include edit HISTORY of each note in the search results
      'A'       --  Include AUTOSAVEs in search results in addition to history
