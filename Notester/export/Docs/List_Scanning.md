    This tight set of list commands enable a diversity of high speed list gymnastics.  Here we describe 
    two basic forms:  Loose Scanning and exhaustive scanning:
    * LOOSE SCANNING -- In scanning a list where only a few items will be scanned, one can simply click on each 
      item to be adjusted, and then executing on of the upgrade/downgrade operations as appropriate.
    * On each item you can upgrade or down-grade or retain the item as appropriate.
      - Upgrading items in current TODO list might be used to organize subset to attack today.
        (Using the 'MS' MOVE to START command)
      - Downgrading items in the current TODO list that cannot be done today could be done by 
        the 'M2' MOVE group 2 command.
      - Upgrading items from the TODO list to the FIRST list is done by the 'TF' THROW to FIRST command.
      - Downgrading items from the TODO list to the B-LIST is done by the 'TB' THROW to B-LIST command.
    * EXHAUSTIVE SCANNING -- When you want to make an explicit decision about most or all items on a
      list you can clicking on the first entry in a list will highlight that item in green.  Then 
      repeatedly pressing the 'N'ext key will quickly traverse the list, allowing the same upgrade/downgrade
      actions listed above.

    The idea with notester is to use overflow lists and breaking down lists to keep any one list from 
    getting larger than a dozen or two items.  This ensures that scanning a list is a very quick operation
    so it can be done spur-of-the-moment as needed on any list needed in order to maintain freshness/accuracy
    of contained info.

    As a single example imagine it is 2:30 and you find the remainder of your afternoon will be focused
    on helping a collegue with an a last minute activity.  How can you best spend the next few minutes?
    Create a blank line at the top of your TODO list (to form a new empty group), then perform an exhaustive 
    scan of the top part of the TODO list by repeatedly pressing the 'N' key.  Any item that absolutely *must* 
    happen today can be noted as such by pressing 'MS' MOVE START keys.  Once you have scanned the first group 
    (which was the original group of items to be done today) you now have a new smaller group that really will
    be done today.  The remainder of the original list will be sitting there for you tomorrow, when you come 
    in, and you can update its organization based on the priorities as you find them then.  Before leaving 
    tonight, you just have to make sure that you have managed to click off all those items
    in your shorted TODO list.
