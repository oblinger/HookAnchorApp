    Known Issues With Notester

    <<>>
    NOTESTER IS LOCKED
    - System may appear locked dialog prompt has been pushed into the background 
      (look at that task manager below to see if any Notester windows has been covered.) 
    - The Quick Create command's menus will sometimes lock cover the Create dialog and 
      system will freeze since it is waiting for input on the create dialog
    ---> Notester aggressivly saves state, so it is genarally safe to terminate and restart notester.

    <<>>
    DO NOT RUN MULTIPLE NOTESTERS AT ONCE !!!
    - This will evenually corrupt the Notester.Log file
