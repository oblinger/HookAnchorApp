# Docs.GOTO\_CMD --


    Goes to a note by name.  The generated menu lists all shortnames consistent with the prefix of characters
    typed by the user.  

    The user may type a fullname (with embedded '.' characters) at the goto prompt.  For example
    the user might type TAB-G  'd' 'o' 'c' 's' '.' 'g' 'o' 't' 'o' 'c' 'm' 'd'  to load this note.

    The goto command ignores case and ignores other non-alpha, non-numeric characters in the destination
    note name.  (Searches by <<>>)
