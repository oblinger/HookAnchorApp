    IN-BOX & HOME
    The IN-BOX is a place to stash things temporarily.  Items should be 
    either be completed or moved to another list quickly.  The In Box 
    should never get cluttered, time critical items will be mixed in
    randomly and you may miss them.  (Empty this list multiple times
    a day.)  HOME is the 'in-box' for you personal or home life.


    TODO & FIRST
    The TODO list is main workhorse list.  It contains your moment-to-moment 
    activities, as well as hte activities you plan to do today.
    Items that "hang" on this list for days need to be moved off, and
    the top section should always be your current plan for the next hours
    of small task work.

    the "FIRST things" list is a special part of your todo list.  Most of the
    time it is empty, but when it is not, you should either do the item or
    move it off the first list.  (you can leave items if you *cannot* do them
    right now.)  The goal is for your eyes to be trained it something is in
    this list it always gets your attention "first."

    OPPORTUNE & KILLER
    The OPPORTUNE list is for items that are important and/or must be done
    in a timely fashion, but don't have a specific week when they must be
    done.  In your weekly scan the top items on this list should be organized.
    When you have a spare moment in your schedule, or need a change of
    pace, pull from this list.

    KILLER is the part of the opportune list that are "killing" you.
    Those things that, since they don't need to get done at any particular 
    time, you are *Never* doing them, and are mentally building a resistance 
    to finishing.  Important items that hang around on your opportune 
    list for too long are ideal candidates for the 'killer' list.

    B-LIST & QUARTERLY
    The B-LIST is for things of lower importance, and that have almost
    no time frame associated.  This is a place to shove things that often 
    waste time when more pressing activities should be attended to.  Or 
    they are things that must be done, or may become important to do, in 
    the months ahead but are not pressing now.  Because the B-LIST is a 
    "relief valve" list allowing you to demote item from other lists, 
    it may become quite long.  There is no point in a B-LIST (which you see
    every day) with dozens of entries, since you willnever be attending to them. 
     
    The QUARTERLY list is a more extended version of the B-LIST.  As the B-LIST
    grows there is a point that you know you are not going to be getting
    to some of these items, yet they "migh" become more critical, or
    that miricle catchup month might occur.  Fine, in order to not have to 
    make that painful and occasionally incorrect decision to delete, we
    have the "quarterly" list as our "off screen" holding tank.  This list
    can grow as large as needed with little consequence.  Make the promise
    you view every item on this list at least once a month or once
    a QUARTER, so that you feel comfortable that items sent there will have
    an opportunity to come back.  Indeed when you scan the QUARTERLY
    list you are not doing the items, you are just scanning to see if any 
    items have jumped up in importance, and need to be brought back to
    one of you every day lists.

    JOY
    The joy list is a list of "reward" activities that you can pull from 
    when appropriate.  E.g. recreational reading, fun people to call, etc.
    Importantly, Joy is also a place to put distractors.  For example, your 
    getting work done, and it occurs to you that your occupation depends 
    on foreign investment, and well you could surf the web to find out how 
    much housing prices have increased in third world countries over the 
    last 20 years.  Fine.  Put that thought on the 'joy' list, you can 
    look it up later.


    The goal of this cascade of lists is to provide ways to keep all the daily
    lists manageable.  You can only do so many things in a day, and
    these lists become useless and demoralizing if items aren't moving and are'nt
    kept to a minimum.


    CALLS
    List of calls to make.  (I don't use this list, I would rather have
    calls noted in Todo, Opportune, or B-List as appropriate.)

    DECIDE
    Things that require a decision.  (I don't like this list, since
    it is not clear when it should be acted upon, instead
    I place thing on Todo, Opportune, or B-List as appropriate.

    This next set of lists are used to keep track of larger project tasks.
    These tasks take multiple days and require subtasks to be organized.

    AGENDA
    Each item is a person or group's name, and the body of that entry contains agenda

    you may just want to go ahead a create the meeting entry instead)

    LISTS
