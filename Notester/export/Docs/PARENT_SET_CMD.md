# Docs.PARENT\_SET\_CMD --


    Prompts for a new parent for the current note.  

    * This performs the same action as clicking on the parent entry for a note.  
    * The parent for a note is always listed in the top right.  This note's parent is:  [Docs. Tab Commands]
    * This uses the same prompting that the <<>> does.
