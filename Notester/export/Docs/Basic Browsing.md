    You are currently looking at the Notester Browser Window, it displays a set of editable, inter-linked 
    notes (like a personal wiki or web site.) This section provides basic navigation and editing commands 
    for the Noteser Browser.

              <<>>

    Notester information is organized into a set of pages called notes.  
    Each note is like a web page--like a web page these notes have an address 
    (their name), a title, and links to other pages contained in them.  The note you are
    reading right now for example has the name 'Docs.Basic Browsing' which is 
    listed at the top line in the display.  In full screen mode its title 
    'Basics of Browsing and Editing' is listed in the line below that.

    For organizational purposes each note is organized into folders and sub-folders like 
    the directories on your computer.  Just like each file has containing folder, each note 
    has a parent.  This note has the parent note 'Docs.Quick_Start' shown in the
    top bar on the right. Children of this note are listed in the panel on the left.  
    This note has a 'Docs.TestChild' and 'Docs.SecondTestChild' listed there.

    We will see this relatively simple tree structure with hypertext links provides 
    a manageable organization of large amounts of personal information.  


    [ NOTESTER NOTES: BASIC NAVIGATION ]
    Clicking on one of the child notes listed in the left will goto that child--it will
    cause that child to be viewed in the main window.  Similarly clicking a link in
    the body of a note like <<>> will go to the view of that note's contents.

    Clicking the "<=" button on the top line of the Notester display above will go back 
    to viewing a previously viewed note.  Please Click the <<>> link now to see
    this jump to the new page.



    [ NOTESTER NOTES: BASIC EDITING ]
    A core Notester design theme is the simplicity of information entry.  A page
    can be changed by simply editing it directly.  Unlike most Wikis or 
    web-page editors, no "edit" mode is needed, and no saves are required.  
    Changes simply become part of that note.  (An infinite edit history of all
    edits is remembered so accidental modifications can be easily undone.  See TAB-H )

    Most of the conventional Windows editing features keys and mouse operations are available 
    for this editing, so we will not elaborate those operations here.  You can go
    to the <<>> an modify that note, then return to see that the changes were
    permanent.  (These DOC pages have been locked so they cannot be edited.)

    There are many ways to add info to Notester.  The <<>> in fact is a 1-second procedure
    for decided the best way.  For now we describe three methods:
    (1) Within any Notester Note one can create a link by just putting '_' characters 
        <<>> words to create a link.  If you click on that link, Notester
        will ask if you want to create a new Note with that name.  Press 'Y' and start adding content.

    (2) The TAB-Q command is used to QUICKLY create new toplevel project pages, new journal entries, etc.
         PROJECTS    -- Has permanent name; associated folder
         TOPICS      -- Has permanent name; mostly no  files

         ACTIVITY    -- Has dated name    ; associated folder
         JOURNAL     -- Has dated name    ; no files

    (3) The TAB-W command is used to create all entries above but WITHIN some existing project.

    We provide a discussion of these special types of Notes and when/how to use them later in this
    tutorial in the <<>> section.

    Just as contents can be modified on the fly, so can the structure of the notes themselves.
    In this section we describe a small set of commands which are sufficient for creating,
    modifying, and navigate this tree of notes.  Each command below is executed by pressing the TAB 
    key followed by the letter key.  We provide a nemonic word to remember each command by.

    B is for BACK.        goes BACK to the previously viewed note
    D is for DELETE.      DELETES current note
    E is for EXPLORE.     shows the directory associated with the note in the Microsoft EXPORER.
    G is for GOTO.        GOTO a node with specified name
    H is for HELP.        shows the HELP info
    Q is for QUICK.       QUICK toplevel note creation (e.g. project, journal entry, etc.)
    S is for SEARCH.      SEARCHES for notes within Notester.
    U is for UP.          goes UP to the parent of the current note
    W is for WITHIN.      create note WITHIN project (not at toplevel)
