# Docs.Adding\_Info --


    There are many ways to add info to Notester.  The <<>> in fact is a 1-second 
    procedure for decided the best way.  For now we describe three methods:

    (1) Within any Notester Note one can create a link by just putting '_' characters 
        <<>> words to create a link.  If you click on that link, 
        Notester will ask if you want to create a new Note with that name.  Press 'Y' 
        and start adding content.

    (2) The TAB-C is the menu for CREATING new toplevel notes.
        TOPICS   -- Info rememberd by name (medical vaccination history)
        PROJECTS -- For large tasks remembered by name (completed in months or years)
                    ** Use very short (2-6 char) abbreviations **
        ACTIVITY -- Smaller task within project (writing a single paper).  Not retrieved by name.
        JOURNAL  -- Notes associated with project, not retrieved by name

    We provide a discussion of these special types of Notes and when/how to use them later in this
    tutorial in the <<>> section.
