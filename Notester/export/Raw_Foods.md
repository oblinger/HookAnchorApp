    Unfortunately, my chia recipe does require a blender. 
    But, as I mentioned earlier, the general ratio of chia seeds 
    to liquid is a 1/3 cup of dry seeds for every 2 cups of liquid. 
    Experiment with ratios to achieve your preferred thickness and 
    then add whatever toppings you like: fresh and/or dried fruits, 
    raw nuts (such as almond, walnut, pecan) raw seeds (such as pumpkin,
    sunflower, hemp), any spices to add sweet or savory flavorings, etc.
    There are countless possibilities. :] We order many of our raw food

    online source for raw food items is Nuts
