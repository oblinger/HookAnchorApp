    =======
    WHAT -- Improve systems humanity uses to operate. 

    HOW  -- Imagine and build computational mechansims that allow a radially diffrent ways to solve some core problem

    WHY  -- I think of everything as "a mechanism" so for me improving humanity is 
            improving the machinery the humanity "runs on" when solving its problmes.

            I am especailly good at thinking about tech that just does not exist but COULD exist.
            Thinking simultaneously at a super abstract "key-aspects" level and at a very concrete level.

            For me everything is a mechanism, so improving humanity is improving 

            because that is what I am differentially good at.
            (specifically imaginging a tech that does not exist, and a new way humanity could work give the tech)
            because it is the primary way that societies change.
            because it is the best way for me to make the biggest difference I can make

    - Hollywood pitch
      AnalyticFire -- Predictive analytics to drive to DevOp service Sales and Scaling.

      Predictive Models:  tie  DevOp Services --> Quant Perf Metrics  -->  Bottom Line

      FLOSS.  SALES(ammo).  SCALING.  


      We build predictive models that tie DevOp services to quantitatve 
      performace metrics and then ties those to company bottom lines.


    - Elevator Pitch
        we all know that dev inf critial piping 
      * FLOSSING  Good DevOps is like flossing.  we all know it is a good idea, but cannot specfically tie 
                  particular choice to a known outcome.
      * SALES     Need projective direct connecions to drive sales.  
        SCALING   Need metrics to monitor execution to scale human organization.
      * AMMO      Provides CTO w. ammo to compete with the CMO  for limited resoruces 
      




    ========

    DISCOVERY 
    - Who you are: your team, Customers, Problems, 
    - how to begin to solve
    - position yourself
    - how to be superman?

    PROB<<>>SOLN FIT
    - Validate the PROBLEM, validate the SOLUTION, validate the BUISNESS, then build it.
    - Lean Canvas (Plan A) goal is to get to Plan B is fastest.



    LEAN CANVAS SLIDE   leancanvas.com
    - Problem:  Solution<<>>KeyMetrics
    - Unique Value Proposition
    - Customer Segments:  Unfair advantages, channels

    = Cost Structure <<>> Revenue stream
      Product          Market


    VALIDATION:  Right?  Founder, Customer, Problem, Solution
    - are YOU a customer?  or at least really immersed?

    CUSTOMER PERSONAE (should have about 8-10)
    - Distinguishing Characteristics
    - Current behavior<<>>workflow
    - Fears<<>>Frustrations
    - Aspriations<<>>Goals
    ==> trying to find out what you DON'T know yet.
    ==> build cohorts big enough to start seeing signal out of the noise (of different opinions)
    ==> Keep asking 'till about 1<<>>3 of your ideas came from them NOT you.




    TAM -- Total Addressable Market     $24B IBIS estimate w. 
    SAM -- Service addressible market   all that bought

    Market is big enough.  I can be the leader, or number

    EXIT STRATEGY
    - three levels:  these kinds of guys acquire in this way...   at this level then ....

    CULTURE
    - Really figure out what culture you want.  
    - People like change.  WaveBucks.  FunToBeCheap



    PRODUCT MARKET FIT
    - Do we have our numbers for:  Activation, Retention, Revenue
    - then Sean Ellison Test "I would be very disappointed if I could not use this app?"  (need >40% to say 'yes')


    BUILDING THE TEAM (8-months)
    - Marketing/PR  --  get cheap young energetic 'pr-ish'     never hire agency, never hire senior guy
    - NO Sales         --  not yet
    - NO Controller

    notes and homework during course



    Cro. Mind meld w cust
    Ur cust
    Stretch
    Where u going
    Understand the why

    - Improve way humanity operates.  Systematic, mechanistic, ml
    - imagine and build tech that enables rAdicaly different approach to core problems
    - because it is what I do well, because it is the way to make largest delta, because human condition is a product of conditions
