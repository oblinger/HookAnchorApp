    Context discovery is the process of discovering groups of  
    similar situated queries.  Each discovered group is a possible new 
    context term.  For example a fixed set of users might all ask questions 
    related to a particular course in Java they are all taking.  The 
    system might recognize this group of all queries originating from  
    this fixed set of users.  The administrator might label this new context 
    attribute as "User_In_Beginning_Java."  The system would then update 
    the relevant user interaction records with this new context attribute. 
     
    Note: since clustering has access to all types of context (as described in ###), 
    as well as the query/responses the new context attributes may relate to  
    complex combinations of these pieces.  E.g. Members of the software group 
    whose last five queries were regarding network protocols.
