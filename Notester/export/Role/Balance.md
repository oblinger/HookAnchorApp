    Spiritual/Contemplative/Deciding
    - So absorbed in work & ideas, literally cannot stop thinking about it
    - The barrier to thinking about it is high, longer I avoid it the higher it gets
    - Keep restarting, any movement I obtain is lost after a period away from it
    - I don't know what to do when I decide to think about it.
    - So many 'weighty' things in my life.  It is hard to give appropriate weight to elaine
