    SELF-BETRAYAL
    (1)  An act contray to what I feel I should do for another is called an act of "self-betrayal"
    (2)  When I betray myself, I begin to see the world in a way that justifies my self-betrayal.
    (3)  When I see a self-justifying world, my view of reality becomes distorted.
    (4)  So--when I betray myself, I enter the box.
    (5)  Over time, certain boxes become characteristic of me, and I carry them around with me.
    (6)  By being in the box, I provoke others to be in the box.
    (7)  In the box, we invite mutual mistreament and obtain mutual justification.
         We *COLLUDE* in giving each other reason to stay in the box.

    THE BOX
    - In the box:  We see others as objects a means to our ends
    - Out of the box:  We see others as they are--as people with goals that are important like ours are.
    - Focused on self--not on achieving results.
    - Need to justify own position, so you need others to fail; need others to cause problems for you.

    BOX PROBLEMS
    INITIAL FEELING:   "Do my best to help the company and the people within it to achieve results"
    CHOICE 1:  Honor that feeling.
    CHOICE 2:  Betray that feeling  "Self-betrayal"

    WHAT DOESN'T WORK WHILE IN THE BOX
    - Trying to change others
    - Doing my best to "cope" with others
    - Leaving
    - Communicating
    - Implementing new skills or techniques
    - Changing my behavior

    >>>  HOW YOU JUMP OUT OF THE BOX
         - "You question your own virtue."   
           In an instant you see the hipocracy in your own anger
         - THE WAY OUT:  see yourself with others --> makes you want to be out

    >>>  HOW YOU STAY OUT
         - "You honor your sense of obligation to others

    >>   DOES BEING OUT OF THE BOX CREATE AN OVERWHELMING STREAM OF OBLIGATIONS?
         - Limited number of people that you directly interact with limits the number of obligations.
         - People with significant closeness and significant interaction deserve significant attention from us.
         - However, this does not mean we do everthing that we feel would be ideal.
           We have our own responsibilities
         - WE DO THE BEST WE CAN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
         - Being out of the box is lighter and easier, that the self-justification needed while in the in-box alternative.
         - Being out of the box does not imply being easier on other, it only means that we see others as "Persons"
           we consider their goals and perspectives too.

    HOW TO GET OUT?
    HOW TO STAY OUT?

    KNOWING THE MATERIAL
    - Self-betrayal leads to self-deception and "the box."
    - Whe you in the box, you can't focus on results.
    - Your influence and success will depend on being out of the box.
    - You get out of the box as you cease resisting other people.

    LIVING THE MATERIAL
    - Don't try to be perfect.  Do try to be better
    - Don't use the vocabulary--"the box," as so on--with people who don't already know it.
      Do use the principles in your life.
    - Don't look for others' boxes.  Do look for your own.
    - Don't accuse others of being in the box.  do try to stay out of the box yourself.
    - Don't give up on yourself when you discover you've been in the box.  Do keep trying.
    - Don't deny you've been in the box when you have been.  
      Do apologize, then just keep marching forward, trying to be more helpful to others in the future.
    - Don't focus on what others are doing wrong.  Do focus on what you can do right to help.
    - Don't worry whether others are helping you.  Do worry whether you are helping others.
