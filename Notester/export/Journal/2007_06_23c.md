    Non Disclosure Agreement

    I agree to not disclose or make use any of the capabilities, ideas, or intellectual property
    embodied in Dan Oblinger's Notester system, or his ideas discussed or written regarding 
    Information Management.


    Intellectual Property

    Further, the early collaborations we engage in, regarding Notester and Information Management, 
    will not reduce Dan Oblinger's control over the intellectual property (including software, written 
    materials, and concepts) associated with Notester and Information Management will remain under 
    Dan Oblinger's control.

    At some future point, we expect to revise these agreements in the case that a fruitful 
    ongoing collaboration is formed.
