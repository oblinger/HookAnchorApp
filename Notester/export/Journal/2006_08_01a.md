    meeting with charlie and barbara

    WAR REPORT
      - Progress within TL
      - Release of RFI
      - Characterization of a form of automated learning that is driven by mentoring; in that same way that humans are
        *  What BL will enable
        *  Produced architecture that will allow different researchers contribute relevant methods of learng from instruction into a single system
        *  Fleshed out how architecture applies to two examples:  UAV & a strategy game
        *  Recieved permission to release BAA for program to build this system


    APPROACH TO TL
      - Taking TL as its custodian -- mostly within the bounds of the program as it is currently defined.
      - Issues with go/no-go tests.
      - Issues with disjointness.   try to build the best high level story.
      - Not sure if we will ever find strong direct MIL transfer


    TIMELINE
    * Re-planning TL
    * Writing RFI
    * Writing Ladder APIs; Interlingua API; and APIs for set of Natural Instruction Methods
    * Developing three detailed scenerios

    AUG 14    -- Announce RFI
    SEPT 1    -- Release Ladder & Interlinga APIs for comment
    SEPT 13      TL Y2 Pitch
    SEPT 20   -- Workshop in Bay
    OCT  1    -- Release Revised APIs
    OCT  14   -- Release BAA

    March 1 src selection pitch


    WHAT IS "IN" THE RED TEAM
      - human evaluation
      - evaluation setup and execution  (Running test servers; Software packaging)
      - common interface code
      ? ladder api "maintainace"
      ? ** interlingua **   maintainace                <--------
