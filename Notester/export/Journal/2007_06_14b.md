    letter for cindy



    Doug and Michael,

    Very happy to be working with the Cycorp team on the Bootstrapped Learning program 
    (as well as the Transfer Learning program).  I feel the BL seed effort has pushed
    the Cycorp team in directions that were at times orthogonal to the larger mission
    of the organization.  While I can feel the attention given to the effort wax 
    and wane as other concerns come and go, I am happy to report a positive overall
    assessment of the team's earnest efforts and ability to deliver, when their attention
    is focued.  

    As we move into the BL efforts I will be relying on the ingenuity of your team
    further still.  Because the goals of the BL curricula development is not to provide a
    clean KR approach to each curricula, rather to replicate the messyness inherent in 
    human
