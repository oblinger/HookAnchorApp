    BLCs

    -------------------
    Some IL code

    Defsyntax ActionsForWorld1 extends Action;

    DefSyntax BLC ( ClassOf Action action, ListOf Rule rules );

    BLC(name=blc7, action=classOfActionsForWorld1, rules=RulesPkg17 )

    Package RulesPkg17 of Rule
      Rule(name=rule1, ...)

    end


    <<>> The following IL functions are provided in order to convert contents of pkg into a list:
    <<>> Pkg2List( currentPkg, classOfRule )    extracts all instances of specified class as list in same order as in pkg
    <<>>
    <<>> When a BLC is specified, if any of its fields are null, I believe we simply compute default values which draw
    <<>> appropriate elements from the current package, alternatively we can just adopt a convention that many BLC
    <<>> will look like a big chunk of boiler plate:
    <<>>
    <<>> World(name=blc1,
    <<>>     syntax=ThisPkg(classOfSyntaxStmt),    <<>> Here Is, Arg, and DefSyntax are all assumed to extend 'SyntaxStmt'
    <<>>     action=classOfAction,
    <<>>     code  =ThisPkg(classOfCodeStmt),
    <<>>     ...
    <<>>
    <<>> I am assuming that BLCs are defined in the same package where all the knowledge in the BLC is also placed, but
    <<>> one might not do that if that knowledge was computed in a more complex way, then it might be in separate packages.



    ---------------------------------
    Interpretation of a DefSyntax stmt:

    DefSyntax Foo extends Bar;
    is(Foo, Bar)
    is(ListOfFoo, ListOfBar)
    is(ClassCompatibleWithFoo, ClassCompatibleWithBar)
    ClassCompatibleWithFoo(name=classOfFoo)


    NOT! ...    PackageOfRule(name=RulesPkg17, elements=Rule(name=Rule1,...), ...)
    NOT! ...    arg(ListOfFoo,elements,ListOfFoo)    ????
    NOT! ...    is(PackageOfFoo, ListOfFoo)          ????


    ---------------------------------
    PACKAGES CAN BE NESTED
    Name of package is interpreted within the outer package context

    package Foo <<>>
            return ILObject.create( b.toString(); }
            return b.toString();                         <<>> this is also legal
        }
    }
