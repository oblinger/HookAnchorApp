    And here is a link to Old Rag - It is a very popular trail climb but it is popular for a reason!

    And finally here is a little something about Hogback.  The Fire Road they mention always made for a nice hike too.

    Hello Dan,
     
    The pilot who took us out the other day is John Corradi of Blue Ridge Biplane Rides.  
    His phone number is 540-937-5371 (home) or 540-718-3717 (cell).  He does not yet have a 
    web site as far as I know, but I think he is working on that.  The ride we took was one 
    hour for $400 and it was great fun.
     
    For canoe trips, we have used Shenandoah River Outfitters (we found them to be helpful, 
    friendly, and reasonably priced); their website is www.shenandoahriver.com and their 
    phone number is 1-800-6canoe2.
     
    If that does not work out, you can also try Downriver Canoe Company www.downriver.com 800-338-1963.  We have no personal experience with this company, but the brochure is very nice.
     
    Please let us know if there is anything else we can help with.  We look forward to seeing you next weekend.
