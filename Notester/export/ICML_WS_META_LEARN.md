    ICML-2005 WS on Meta-learning REVIEW FORM: COMMENTS FOR THE ORGANIZERS
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    AUTHORS: 
    TITLE: Comparing learning approaches to coreference resolution.  There more to it than bias.

    NAME OF THE REVIEWER: Dan Oblinger

    YOUR CONFIDENCE ABOUT YOUR DECISION:
    < [High]   Medium   Low >

    RELEVANT COMMENTS ABOUT YOUR DECISION:

    I accepted the paper because it is a good *Workshop* paper.  It is missing fleshing out
    that it should have for a conference paper.  It is a very nice workshop paper.
