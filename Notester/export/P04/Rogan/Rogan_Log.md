# P04.Rogan.Rogan\_Log --



    Here is a promising set of instructions from one of the redbooks I posted the other day.  It is about 5 pages, and spans 3 "levels" of the document heirarchy.  The annotations are in the xml file (these are linked to from the wiki as well).  

    <<>>
    <<>>

    Have performed this procedure, but more widgets will need to be instrumented to get a full trace.  These are:

    text fields
    combo boxes
    right-click menus (this occurs twice)
    menus

    I can work on instrumenting these if everyone else is busy, although I may bug one of you for 10-15 min to get orriented with the relative code.
