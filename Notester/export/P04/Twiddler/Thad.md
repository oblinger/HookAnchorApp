    it should answer many of the questions.

    Steve-  There are a few tricks to typing on the
    Twiddler that Handykey doesn't talk about in the
    manual.  Let's see if I can walk you through it.

    1)  Select which hand you are going to use and put
    the strap on the appropriate side
    2)  Undo the velcro
    3)  Hold the Twiddler so that your fingers are
    bent tightly and are on the buttons closest your
    palm.  The finger joints in your palm should be
    slightly in front of the front face of the Twiddler.
    Put your thumb on the opposite side of the Twiddler.
    You should be able to hold the device without the
    strap and reach all the buttons (if awkwardly).
    Make sure that you are holding the Twiddler such
    that your little finger can hit all 3 buttons on
    the bottom row.  The little finger is the biggest
    problem in fine tuning your Twiddler grip.  The next
    step will help.
    4) Hold the Twiddler with the finger buttons
    facing away from you.  Velcro the strap such that it
    is
    below your knuckles (below your fingers).  Ideally,
    when you press the velcro against the bottom of the
    Twiddler there is a slightly angle towards your body
    (i.e. the edge of the strap is not quite parallel
    to the front of the Twiddler).  This helps twisting.
    5)  Take some glue and glue the top of the strap
    in the slot close to the top of the Twiddler.  Without
    glue, the strap can slip in the slot, causing the
    Twiddler to rotate on your hand.
    6)  Keep your thumb against the side of the Twiddler
    as much as possible when you type (i.e. if the strap
    broke, you would still maintain a hold
    on the Twiddler).   A lot of people put their thumb
    on the same side as their palm, which is what the
    Handykey manual shows.  This technique, in my
    opinion, causes the Twiddler to rotate too much.
    7)  Download our Java Twiddler tutor (Twidor) and
    practice in 20minute sessions.  You'll get
    quick much faster than you expect.

    Just like learning a musical instrument (guitar,
    clarinet, etc.) or the QWERTY keyboard for the first
    time, your fingers will get tired and strained easily
    as a novice.  However, I found that after the first
    week of using the Twiddler as my primary keyboard,
    this when away.

    Informally, I've found guitar players pick up the
    Twiddler faster than someone who doesn't.  One
    tantilizing thing we are seeing in the data is that
    the people who learn the Twiddler the fastest
    press the keys in a chord simultaneously instead
    of sequentially.  We're still doing analysis.

    BTW, the Twidor will be getting more advanced in
    the future as we continue the research.
    Currently, it is just what we used
    in the study, without the timed sessions.

    USB Twiddlers work directly on Macintosh laptops.
    I use an iBook for demos.
