    Folks,
    It was quite an enjoyable meeting yesterday. We generated a few ideas. My notes from the meeting follow. Beside every idea I have identifed an owner. The next step is for the owner to flesh the idea out a little bit in the form of a short-write up or a few foils (or a demo, if the an embodiment exists). These will form input to the followup meeting. In the meeting lets try to triage the ideas (new ones are also welcome) and try to get at an idea about "coolness/impact" and "realizability/timeframe" of the ideas.

    Leigh, can you please schedule a follow up meeting in the first week of June with the to-list (its ok if absoutely everyone is unable to make it). Subject "mydocs innovation". Thanks.
