    "Lenny, Dan,
    Here's the ICALP paper.  I'm in Switzerland right now attending a
    conference and have unreliable access to the internet (oddly enough,
    in the land where the internet was born).  I can't read the paper now,
    but we should discuss it at some point.
    -Nina
    P.S. Lenny, can you forward this to Sardia?  I can't remember his email address.
     - Clustering.ps"
