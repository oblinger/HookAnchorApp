# Book On Organization -- Create a new PROJECT

    <<>>


    - proj-list is parent
    - all lists are proj
    - parent proj parent is ancestor parent
    - all is top???
    - globzal list is first jcontaindd
    - proj todo not is entries is shown as child
    - z tells you to name note in no list
      item moved to notweser orphans whne not in list
    - cmd to add not throw to another list 

    throw from parent to non-global:  change parent
    throw from <<>> to g-g or p-p is move; from in box is alway move


    list journal:
    - active list items for all contained lists
    - reverse order completion list of item title

    views: journal, list<<>>titles, names 

    - dont show search-all list immediately

    **  CORE CONCEPTS  **
    *********************

    INFO HASHING <<>> INFO ONLY IN ONE PLACE

    PROJECT BASED ORGANIZATION
    - Bucket org & simple indexing, scalable, self cleaning

    CONTEXT BASED PRESENTATION

    GTD:  NEXT STEP ANALYSIS  (Pit fall, flyin @ treetop level & you will hit somthing)

    7HABITS:  Quad 2

    JOURNALING:  where to place info, where to find info?  (you mean when)

    WEEKLY FLOW:

    PLANNING FLOW:
    7HABITS:  Roles -> Goals -> Actions


    SPATIAL INDEXING:   I remember I put it *there*

    MULTI-AXIS SEARCH
    MULTI-REP

    LIST STRUCTURING.  grouping, ordering, adding spaces here and there

    LIST SCANNING.   do tomorrow, do later


    (1)  COCKPIT CONTROL PANEL.    If you can't see it, you will forget it.
         --> So we structure *all* you need to see on one screen.

    (2)  INPUT REFLEX.   If you have to think about it, you won't do it.
         --> So we have a *simple* process for inputing all forms of new info.

    (3)  LIST SCRAPING.  OFFLOADING.  If there are more than a few items you won't read it.
         --> So we continuously re-organize stale info away from your main view

    (4)  If it isn't the easiest path FOR YOUR CURRENT GOAL, you won't do it.
         --> So we provide a variety of input methods which allow entering info WITHOUT
             having to decide how and what to do with 

    (5)  VISUAL FLOW.  If you don't continuously check your lists, you wont trust or use your lists.
         If you can't check your lists in seconds you wont check them.
        --> So we develop a scan path for you eyes to follow 

    (6)  Fractions of a seconds count.  You wont get most value from notester if you
         dont use it most of the time, and you wont use it most of the time if it 
         is not instant.
         --> Keyboard based control

    (7)  You wont put the thousands of items of info in your life into it, if it is not
         the most convenient way to find that info later.
         --> So we use tree-based indexing, indexing by name, multi-axis searching,
             project-centric organization to facilatate flexible storage/retrieval of
             very large very unstructured data


    A bit of advice:  Ease into notester.  Start using it *all* *the* *time* for a few
    simpler tasks.  Once you find value, and are comfortable, then increase the
    set of things you use it for.  Whenever you start using Notester for tracking a new
    thing, try to *always* use it for that thing.
