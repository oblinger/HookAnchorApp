# PBG --


    - Ready for live testing w. RLAC
    - Understanding where we are.
      WE are done, execept we are not.  (e.g. hard coded .genadi address, hardcoded deposit info).  
      Wont achieve robustness
    - Doc For Flow  Emails into logic.  <<<<   need to think thru and walk thru code here
    - Verify pay data structures
    DietDiary

    - Semantics of all parameters

    <<>>
    --- How I am working:
    - I am running hot.  lots of swapping.  lots of unexpected, lots of connecting and communicating, deciding
      chunks of 1-2 hr things
    - these next weeks will continue & I gotta do whatever whenever
    - But best value is *not* doing things I can delegate.
       --> If we have too many delegatable things we should just hire another engineer part/full time
           swapping not efficient, and am not as efficient 




    - end2end ready for RLAC
      (payment, & data layer, but not vouching for view/validation, etc)

    - unified id, and pbg and merchant ids



    ZZZZZZZZ
    - Running pretty hot.  3/4 time is not on this list.
    - This week special, but where I should be moving my time:

    Best Use of Me
    - Avoid swapping costs:
    - Things that engineer cannot do.
