    A sexist funny sent by a friend in seminary: "Subject: Paradise"

    When everybody on earth was dead and waiting to enter Paradise, God appeared 

    and said, "I want the men to make two lines.  

    One line for the men who were true heads of their household and the other 

    line for the men who were dominated by their women.

    "I want all the women to report to St Peter." Soon, the women were gone and 

    there were two lines of men.

    The line of the men who were dominated by their wives was 100 miles long, 

    and in the line of men who truly were heads of their household, there was 

    only one man.

    God said, "You men should be ashamed of yourselves. I created you to be the 

    head of your household. You have been disobedient and not fulfilled your 

    purpose.

    I told you to be the spiritual leader in your family.

    Of all of you only one obeyed. Learn from him! Tell them my son, how did you 

    manage to be the only one in this line?"

    The man replied, "I don't know, my wife told me to stand here."
