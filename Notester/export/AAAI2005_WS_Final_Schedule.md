# AAAI2005\_WS\_Final\_Schedule --

    Dear Workshop Organizers,

    Here is the final schedule for the AAAI-05 Workshop Program, to be held Saturday and Sunday, July 9-10. The program chairs have made every effort to accommodate any special requests you have made, and have also coordinated with the Tutorial Forum cochairs to avoid conflicts.

    Please take a moment to review this schedule now, and make a note of the day that your workshop is scheduled. We just wanted to remind you that the day pattern of the conference is slightly different in 2005, with the workshops starting one day earlier on Saturday. The technical program will begin Monday morning.

    Thank you for your work thus far on the workshop program, and please feel free to contact us at aaai05@aaai.org if you have any questions.

    Regards,

    Corina Anzaldo
