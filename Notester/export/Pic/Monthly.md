    Hi Dan, 
    I'm starting to parcel out some of the AI PIC responsibilities to members of the organizing committee. 
    I was hoping I could ask you to be responsible for organizing the monthly PIC lunches. 
    This would entail the following: 
    1.  Reserving a conference lunch room for each meeting.  The lunches will alternate between Yorktown and Hawthorne.  I think your dept. secy. will know whom to contact to reserve a room (I think it is different for Hawthorne and Yorktown.  I also think there is  a policy that a reservation isn't really final, because it can always be bumped for something more important, but this is something we will always have to deal with.) 
    2.  For each meeting, asking someone to give a short update on their work . 
    3.  Sending out notices to the AI PIC before each PIC lunch (say, 7-9 days before, and the day before?  or whatever you think best). 
     
    We had originally planned to have the May lunch on May 2, but this became impossible for me because I had a PIC chair meeting.  (I had no idea, when this started, just how many general PIC meetings there would be to go to!  One of the reasons I have to start delegating tasks ...)  For this month, should we shoot for next Thursday (May 11) or the following Tuesday (May 16)?  May's lunch is scheduled to be in Hawthorne. 
    For this meeting, since there would be short notice, perhaps one of the organizing committee members could present his or her work (Richard Goodwin?  Irina Rish?) 
     
    I'd  very much appreciate if you could do this.  Please let me know.  I am working from home today, but have access to email, or you can always call at 212-781-6539 (though I screen messages, and sometimes turn down the phone when there are too many telemarketers disturbing me). 
     
    Thanks very  much.
