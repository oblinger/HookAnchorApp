# 999idea.DocUFlow --

    Idea: Documents of all possible types are annotated using a standalone 
    tool to be a flow document.  These documents contain their only routing 
    and control logic. 
     
     
    ACCEESS TO THE FLOW DOC ENGINE: 
    - Standlone desktop app 
    - Email address 
    - Web interface (to see, edit, up/download, authorize, and route) 
    - Wireless pervasive devices 
     
     
     
    - Secretary can have a folder of relevant forms 
    - Joe can erase fields of jim's form and reuse the form 
    - Forms auto route to person's VP's Secretary 
    - Signup sheet created in 5 minutes in users favorite editor 
      is attached to a calendar entry on the corp's proprietary  
      message board. 
     
     
     
    WE CAN PROVIDE THIS SERVICE 
    - without installing any software on client machines. 
    - without restricting the software use to create the flow docuemnt. 
      (indeed it not need to be a form at all, one might just 
       add it directly to the body of an email.  and filling out the 
       form would be done by replying to the email.) 
    - with access possible by: web, email, wireless device, offline app 
    - without restricting transport and storage of documents 
      (Any legacy method for sending receiving storing docuemts 
       will continue to operate on flow documents) 
    - without requiring any additional information or effort on the users part. 
      (Users must fill out form, and present form to flow engine 
       by replying to the email, or any of the methods above.  Call to engine 
       is parameterless, parameters are logically associated with document.) 
    - without requiring any centralized adimistrative maintainance. 
      (unknown person can create new ID, and docuemnts authored and controled 
       by that ID.  If they want authority from others they must request it.)
