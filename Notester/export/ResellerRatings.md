    AVOID THIS SELLER

    On their website they listed the "original" blackberry bold belt clip.  Ships in 24 hours.

    Both were untrue.  No alert was sent.  They simply
    did not send anything for a month.  When they did 
    send a belt clip, it was a knock off, that is so
    tight that it presses on the keys when holstered.

    With so many good retailers online, just avoid this one.
