# life.5b\_letter\_to\_John --

    John,
     
    Thanks.  I have been wanting to write you a letter telling you how things were turning out.
    It was great to be able to talk even if briefly last week.
     
     
    Taking the 'leap' that this new job represents has been very good for me.
    It has changed enlarged my thinking some ways.  My original concerns 
    about security still exist.  I really don't know what I will do at the end of 
    my short tenure at DARPA, but this is almost a freeing thing.
     
    I am growing to like the sense of possibilities in life, rather than, 
    the confines of a known future.  (don't worry, my zest for challenge
    and diversity is not likely to send me over the deep end ... selling
    all and joining a commune or something.)
     
    There is a darkened lining in a few places on my otherwise silvered cloud:
     
    It turns out I do have moral challenges to working at DARPA.
    Not the ones one might expect--not that my labours could be
    used to kill some one  (in fact they could, but so could yours since
    you pay taxes)
     
    At DARPA, ones ability to direct tens of millions of dollars of research,
    has a magnifying effect.  And the near-future for all of humanity is going
    to be radically different than what has been known for  all of its civilized existence.
    Not all change is good.  (Only to satisfy your curiosity you could google 
    "Bill Joy the future doesn't need us")   I try to remind myself regularly
    not to take myself so seriously. 
     
    My penchant for sliding into relationships with apathy nipping at my heels 
    is still a struggle for me.  In the tumult of the lasts months I have been
    still w. they woman I met toward the end of our sessions.
     
    She is not a place holder, but she is also not some of this things
    I thought I wanted.   but we do connect in some very important ways.
    I am more relaxed about this life choice, but still don't feel I have learned
    all the lessions life has in store for me on this front.  
     
     
    In many (all?) areas of life. I feel a sort of Renaissance.  lots of reading, lots of changes
    in what seems to be important to me.  getting christian sermons by tape weekly (from Redeemer
    church here in NYC) and going to a Buddhist meditation center weekly too.  (I don't know, I
    think the Christians might say these two cancel each other out....)
     
    No time for TV.....   keeping close friends, making new ones, and pushing myself
    seem to be the hours of the day.   Some of these are personal, but many are also 
    "on the job."   My new job is all about synthesizing cohesion
    of thought and action among many with different agendas.  my new job is about
    being clear and compelling using little time and few words.   (as you know, this verbose
    boy has a lot of work here!)
     
     
    I am reading a great book I am sure you have seen:  "the road less travelled" by Peck.
    Though his ideals are quite high, it occurs to me that you are a good psychologist by his 
    reckoning:  You extend yourself for your patients.
