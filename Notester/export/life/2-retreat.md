    tripping thru life
    Resigned   spending time is obligation




    My situation w. Yoshiko is
    damaging both of us.  It is unhealthy.
    * It stems from 2 causes:
        - I was focused on marriage
           later & under pressure
           - cowardice & hesitation
        - my ressless ambition 

    -  mismatch: intellectually, 
        temperment, obligation
    + very balance, happy & devoted

    * At this point I have to face up
    to the fact that either 
    - I have created a travesty; to ask forgiveness & move on
    - I have inappropriate expectations, accept my lot & build on it.

    - If we were younger I would definitely move on, maybe in the end I would be with someone no more compatible, but I would have tried.

    - found someone

    - my gut says that there is someone out there 4 me, and that finally I am in a mindset to find them.
    But maybe I have passed that time of life.

    Marrying her will be an occasion to sin, but others will be the same

    for a long time I have been trying to convince myself that I should leave.  But this is the feeling I have had b4
