    I am a sinner  (and I can see how these sins are hurting me)
    - I do not have discipline in my life (lazy)
    - I am prideful.   (worry about credit; troubles interactive w. others; strive incorrectly)
    - My life is not centered on God.
    - My life is not centered on correct principles.
    - Perspective is every thing.
    - I do not love God or my neighbor as I should

    INDEX
    - Introdution: our perspective; goals of the text
      - two mechanisms employed: explicit xlation of terms, thought experiments
    - Mischief caused by mixing perspectives
      - some of the skepticism about theology is really unacknlowedged conflict between tennants of
        differing world perspectives.
      - Bridging these two ontologies: a working definition of existence
      - As needed we will use our common sense to pin down aspects of a term then craft a definition
        (or definitions) of that term using the perspective of our scientific world view.
        Theological questions are then asked in this new vocabulary.  This translation is necessary, 
        since skepticism about questions asked in the old vocabluary may simply be skepticism about the
        old vocablary itself, not about any answer given to the question.
      - Does this translation loose important aspects of the original world view?
        Quite possibly (give example) but it is the only way for science to weigh in, and
        we will see it does not loose all important aspects... science can weigh in on my impt questions.

    - Death of God by Reductionism 

    - Crafting, or cutting God by occams Razor

    - THE PAC WORLD

    - THE BIGGIE:  DOES GOD EXIST?
      - what do we mean by this?  Many senses of our current theological understanding of God

    - THEOLOGICAL QUESTIIONS

    - THE SKEPTICS RETORT
      - why the skeptic?
      - What can we expect: multiple reasons, simple reasons, isomorphic reasons
      - It is all just programming
      - It is all just evolution
      - It is just the nature of sentience

      - Could a universe exists where evolution did not drive it?
        (If not does that make evolution and its inherent consequenes and invarient that creates goodness
         i.e. is it God)



    -------------------------




    Important metaphors:
    - The reasons behind ones action makes all the difference
    - Multiple levels of interpretation exist and most important level is not always the lowest level
    - If I wanted to "goto" a micro world, I would "program" an avatar or emulate impt aspects of myself in that worlds medium


    What is the spirtual world?
    - Thinking entities (persons; god)
    - Intent (the will of an entity)
    - Good will <<>> Ill intent  (good/evil)
    - Community

    - Belief; Knowledge



    Things that matter


    ------------
    * Angular momentum exists at one level but not at lower level

    * Does there exist an entity that is beyond human understanding?
      - progressions have limit points beyond the progression itself, yet one can 
        best understand the progression as being controlled by that limit point.
        
    * did that entity create the universe?  create humanity?    (

    * is there an afterlife?

    * can there be eternal life? heaven, etc.  

    * should we believe that eternal life can be?

    * should we 

    * should we believe that humanity has divinely inspiried knowledge about the universe?
      - clearly it is consistent to believe this.  We have show that evolution and humanity can be 
        programmed to result in such beliefs.  (DNA programming, gate programming of pac man)
      - The question is *Should* we belive it

    * If god does exist why doesnt he just "show up" and prove it?
      - first how would he do that?  what whould it look like if he did that?

    * what is the purpose of life?
      - what would an answer to that question look like?
        - different and different levels, and life would have no meaning at some levels, it would just be random.
      - indeed at the level of atoms there is no meaning to life.   But we know is exactly what we expect.  This in no way diminishes expectation for meaning at other levels!
      - The spirtual level seems to be a useful level to address that question.
        - At spiritual level what does our life on earth provide?  time and space for a persons inhrent nature to "unfold"


    * does God love us?

    * Do we go to heaven when we die?

    * What about reincarnation?

    * there is an inconsistency, the inconsistency is between our still held pre-scientific notions of common words like 'exist' 
      'purpose' etc, and what those words must mean according to a modern scientific world view.  we believe that this inconsistency
      fuels the belief that god is not consistent with science, since we employ pre-scientific notion of exist to god and then
      show that he cannot exist by that standard, but this is inappropriate, we will show that nothing can exist in the scientific
      world view according to some defintions of exist, so this tells us nothing about God, rather it tells us something about 
      humanities state of mixed models of the universe.  To rectify this we start with our commonsense notion for many words
      and then work out a definition for those words in our new scientific world view.  It is these new definitions that we
      then apply in our discussions of faith.  In some cases these definitions will fly in the face of our expectations, but
      like quantum physics, according to the scientific world view we must adjust our expectations, not our emprically derived 
      laws of the universe.


    * have shown vindication and support for existing theological ideas.  
      we do not have support for a great many others.
      what perspective should we adopt with respect to those ideas?

      - recurring ideas within human thought should be viewed as either as the the experimental or theoretical physicist
        views the waxing poetic that the theorietical physicst engages in.  simply as
        interesting possibilities to be seriously entertained based on past successes of the theoretical physisct,
        or less skeptically as potential models of the world to be accepted based in part on their beauty, as well
        as their consistency and support from the world.

      If those perspectives are good enough for those on the leading edge of our scientific world view, they surely
      are not too promiscous for our view of theology.





    FAITH AND REDUCTIONISM

    A reductive view of the universe has proven to be a very powerful 
    approach in understanding the universe.  It is one of the key 
    tennants of the current scientific world view, and that world
    view has afforded humanity unprecidented practical power and
    control over the universe.  

    The practical benefits of this approach over the last two centuries
    have been staggering, which has led many to accept this world view as
    a "correct" world view.  I accept the scientific world view (including
    reductionism) as a correct world view--correct in that it is a useful 
    way to understand the universe.

    But this world view seems at odds with most all theologies of the world.
    Indeed these theologies were developed at a time when reductionism was not 
    really widely known, and certainly was not and accepted world view.
    In that respect is is not surprising that those theologies are not
    based on reductionaism and a scientific world view.

    But does this mean that the essential points inherent in these world theology
    must be *inconsistent* with a scientific world view?  On the surface
    they seem to be quite opposed to one another.  Indeed most of humanity 
    explicitly or in their heart views theology as "unscientific." Further many strong believers
    in science reject theology on that is it not consistent with a scientific world view.

    This text calls that assumption into question.  Here we accept that science
    and many related dogma like reductionism are correct, in that they 
    have been empirically shown to be an effective way of understanding, predicting,
    and manipulating the universe.  We accept that they can uncover "truth" 
    about our universe.  We then look at some of the core beliefs theological
    beliefs in this context and try to understand what those beliefs might mean
    in this context.  We do not try to prove these beliefs, but we try to understand
    if and how they might be formulated in this new world view, and once formulated
    do they make sense from that new world views perspective.


    [[[EXISTENCE]]]
    A PRACTICAL NOTION OF EXISTENCE:   WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SOMETHING TO EXIST?
    - Starting assumptions, things like "the cup in your mom's cubbord" really do exist.
      a lump of stuff; a Cup; Atoms; Microsoft Word; 
      - different senses of the word exist, but saying that a cup, an atom, or microsoft word dont exist in the 
        same way that a clump of matter exists is true but not very useful for our purposes.  In a practical 
        sense they all do exist.
    - Thinking entities like you and I exist.
    - The question is does God exist in this practical sense of exist, like a cup, like you or like myself?


    EXISTENCE
    - Believing in it results in effective prediction.
    - Existence is not "all or nothing"  but thing really have different levels of existence 


    * we  belive that one should adopt the perspective modern physiscit adopts toward newly proposed laws or particles.
      they neither exist nor don't exist at first.  they can be found to be inconsistent, consistent, supported, or vindicated
      by empirical data.  those are the "real" levels of existance according to modern science.

    non-scientific notion of existence.  there is an objective reality, some this "really really" exist, and
    the four levels above are simply our imperfect understanding of what "realy really" exists.  Perhaps this
    is true, but if it is, we have not shown it to be so in the scientific world view.  the number of 
    interlocking "vindicated" facts suggests that some objective reality does exist, but it is hardly
    a proof of it.  Physics believe this is not a relevant question for them, since they can never know
    anything beyond "vindicated" existence anyway.  All facts are subject to overturn.
    We can prove the existance of anthing beyond this level of vindication, so we should not be surprised
    that we cannot prove the existance of God, say, beyond the level of vindication.  
    Thus we must put our foot down here.  The only relevant questions to be asked about Spirituality
    are the four levels of existence above.  disappointment that we don't know if god really really exists
    should be expressed as dissapponitment that we don't know if a cup really really exists.  
    Perfect sucess here would be to know God exists with the same level of certainty that we know that
    a cup exists.

    In this text we argue that some aspects of the spiritual realm are vindicated by current human understanding
    other parts are supported, and some consistent.  (As many readers suspect there are probably some (many)
    theological beliefs that are inconsistent too. We wont dwell on these since they are what the reader already expects, and
    they in no way detract from beliefs with higher degrees of support.)




    SUPPORTING GOD EDGE OF OCCAM'S RAZOR
    - Ok so the notion of a spritual world does exist in the same way that a cup exists.  it is 
      a useful description at one level, but not at another level.  But is there a god
      in that world anything like the god in any world theology?

     

    The seem to be
    quite opposed to one another


    The Pac Man Universe
    - Many gates believe that certains states are preferable to others
      (certains rather rapid and chaotic change of electrical state)
      - Many gates think this definition of "good" is rather arbitrary




    three kinds of miracles:
    (1) Very occasional actions occur at precise points in time
        that must occur at exactly that point in order to have
        the "good" effect that they do.  

        Indeed in some cases the whole universe narrowly avoids
        permenent deteration into a very undesirable state of non-chaotic non-rapid 
        gate changing.  These lockups are avoided by just the right set of gate changes
        at just the right time.  These gate changes seem to be consistent with the
        laws of physics, but there is no way to explain what such a complex set of
        gate changes *must* occur according to physics.  But they do, so there must
        be some explanation of these miracles outside the realm of physics.

    (2) Unbeknownst to the gates, there is a teenage girl "playing" this game of pac
        man.  The girl is manipulating four electrical contacts on the compass points
        of the games joystick.  Her goal of extending the games play is consistent
        with the gates notion of good (chaotic, rapid gate changes).  She runs from 
        monsters with they will kill her and toward the monsters when she can kill them.

        This miricle can only be seen by gates who have realize that a particular set
        of gates count the number of lives left in the universe before the bad state
        of non-chaotic non-rapid gate changing occurs.  They also realize a different
        set of gates contain a counter that is better to be lower (it is the number of 
        monsters on the screen), and a counter which is the distance to the nearest monster.
        Some of the time when the distance to the nearest monster becomes zero the life counter
        goes down (a bad thing), other times the monster counter goes down (a good thing).

        Some how the disntance counter seems to decrease during those period when it is a
        good thing, and in fact often increases when having a zero counter is a bad thing.
        Reductionists believe this is coincidence, but many gates feel in there gut that
        some force seems to be operating in the universe that is striving for good
        (chaotic rapid gate changes).

    (3) Power cycle as system Reset; chip replacement maintainace; and the flood of Noah.


    Ok, so there *can* be miracles in this world consistent with the mircles in religious
    texts, but that doesn't mean that there *have* been miricles like that.


    SELF FUFILLING PROFECIES
    - Multi-level reductionism says that "truth" is some invarent as some level of abstraction.
      Thus god and mircles are "true" if they are such an invarient.

    - Evolving entities must develop upwardly spiralling notions of cooperation



    --------
    Faith supported on the edge of occams razor?

    - Occams razor is a priciple that says one should always adopt the simplest
      explanation as the true explanation since it will be the most likely correct explanation. 

    - Serves us (and the gates) well in understanding the universe.  time and time again the
      most concise explanation turns out to have good explanatory powers.

    - Still certains complex effects (dealing for example with the universe's life counter) 
      don't seem to be explainable by the laws of physics indeed even discussing such a
      random particular set of gates seems to have no specific relevance according to physics
      yet is clearly important for the universe.

    - Thus occam's razor demands that the gates find some concise explanation that accounts
      for the importance of this 




    Universe is more random and didn't have perfect start state like computer.
    Perhaps God "programmed" our universe the way our DNA programs us.  Shape of 
    DNA has nothing to do with our shape, and in the beginning belies little about
    what is to come, still we see that a rather specifically configure human
    is relaibley derived from that sequence.

    One people have goals but you rather arbitrarily gave gates the notion that 
    chaotic rapid gate changing was a "good" state, the opposite was evil.
    but gates in a computer dont have any thought like that, so the analogy fails.
    True the analogy does fail here.  but my goal was to understand how entities 
    could be situated in a universe that had a God, miracles, and external notions of good 
    and evil.  If we are reductionists who believe the we humans are simply programmed automata
    with programed and arbitrary notions of good and evil built in, we can certainly imagine
    more complex gates in a super version of a computer where each gate had arbitrarily 
    programmined notions of good and evil.  There interaction with their universe, and 
    there experience of miricals etc. would be exactly as described here.
