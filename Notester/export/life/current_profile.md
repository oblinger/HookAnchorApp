    INTRO
    Thinking.  Social.  Energetic!  Optomistic.  Urban interests with spritual balance.
    My partner and I both see our world 

    INTRO
    Intellectually oriented, socially sophisticated, and energetic, yet optimistic, spiritually grounded, and emotionally mature.  Urban interests with spiritual  balance.  My soul mate and I see this world as an explosion of win/win, experience expanding, possibilities that enrich us and the world we live in.  Our only frustration is the inherent limit that 24 hours places on our days.  Our relationship provides the secure basis for our lifelong outword-facing exploration of this world.  Our implicit trust fosters independence, yet our common intellectual and social interests provides common ground.

    TRAITS I HOPE WE SHARE:  We have broad intellectual interests: cultures, science, what-makes-people-tick, politics, philosophy, etc.  We are Energetic: up for last minute, late nite, clubbing, or hosting a dinner feast for friends.  Our friends look to us for social possibilities.  Our natural inclination is to give back to a world that has given us much.  If this resonates, please read on, perhaps we are a match!

    ADJECTIVES THAT DESCRIBE ME: I am 5'10", 165lbs physically fit, and clean cut. Energetic/Optimistic -- The first to go out and the last to leave. Thinking -- passionate about learning; always up for a good debate. Trusting/Spiritual -- The one people tell those secrets they have "never told anyone before."  Ambitious -- Just a bit.  My travel through this world should have some positive impact on it. During the 9 to 5 I am an inventor for IBM; I also teach courses at Columbia University. 
    HONESTY IN ADVERTISING.  By activity, demeanor, and looks you will guess my age near 30, yet through twist of fate and persistence of my thesis advisor I am 38.  Here I split the difference at 34, so you can have a peek at my profile and (very current) photo before making your choice.

    If these sketchings match those on the canvas of your imagination drop me a note; let's roll the dice of life.






    FUN:
    Loving New York. I am still new enough to be excited about all there is to see and do: Foreign films, ethnic food, rollerblading, occasional clubbing, and dinner parties, are all regulars on the menu.


    LOCAL AND TRAVEL:
    Coffee shops w. atmosphere: Rita's, Edgar's, DTUT, Coffee Pot. Love the ethnic restaurants on 9av in hell's kitchen; love the Korean shops on 32st, and Dim sum at Pings Seafood.

    FAVORITES:
    Discussing our last movie for an hour. Organizing a group for Sunday dim sum. Learning/doing something new.  I tend to eschew the usual and aim for the other.  New cultures, ideas, and activities, are the bread a butter of a rich and meaningful life.

    READING:
    The Elephant Vanishes -- short stories by Haruki Murakami. I loved it--even convinced a friend to read it 
    just so I would have someone to discuss the stories with
