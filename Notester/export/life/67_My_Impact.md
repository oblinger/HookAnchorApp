# life.67\_My\_Impact --



    I cannot dump on myself because of a general direction of humanity.
    So I can look (as best I can) at the consequences of *my* specific contribution that direction.


    Near Impacts:
    ++  Darpa's budget funds basic AI research (as opposed to other agendas)
    ++  Performers are happier to work with me as PM
    ++  Production from $$ is more efficient, both in basic research and in impact output


    Medium Impacts:
    ++  People have assistants.
    ++  Lower middle class is treated with 

    <<>> Details of life are 'just handled' for lower middle class
    --- Automation removes jobs


    Long Term Impacts:
    ??? Autonomous human level intelligence.


    ---------------------------------
    THE 500 POUND GORILLA:   
            - Automation removes jobs that require lower education levels.
            - What other effects does it have, and on whole do we know if it is net positive <<>> negative ?

    BELIEF:   Most automation job loss is connected to advances in robotics, and low-level perception.  This is not centrally advanced by BL

    BELIEF:   BL will be used as assistants in many situations, it will allow computers to be more useful, and will
              provide the middle class with a greater level of service (since they are not rich enough to have their own 
              servents)
