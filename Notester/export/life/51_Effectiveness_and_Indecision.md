# life.51\_Effectiveness\_and\_Indecision --



    PROBLEM:

    (1)  I have a problem that when a decision is important I become indecisive.
    (2)  When some task is important I procrastinate on it.
    (3)  I am not working hard enough or effective enough these days.

    OBSERVATIONS:

    I try to optomize life and thus I strive to always make correct decisions especially on important matters.

    Anexiety over poor decisions causes me to avoid decisions.

    The longer I have a task or decision hanging over my head, the more anxious about it I become.

    Like I am doing now, when faced with a task or decision, I will spend time "getting ready" rather 
    than diving into the center of it.  I can "get ready" indefinitely.

    At work I will tend to do the least important stuff instead of the high anxiety or less fun work.
    This, coupled with distractions, and limited hours working can almost completely paralyze my work progress.

    Once I "break through" and begin work, I often find the work much easier, or the decision much simpler than anticpated.

    I judge decisions from the perspective of the best choice in hindsight.  I will "give credit" to myself that 
    one cannot be expected to always make the right choice, especially as measured by hindsight.  
    Nonetheless it is with this hindsight that I measure the effectiveness of a decision.  And the
    opportunity cost of any decision is measured against all other possible paths as measured now.

    Decisions made after long consideration often?<<>>? do not seem superior to a quickly made decision.

    When I have a task/decision hanging over my head, I am anxious about it.

    Right now I have a decision hanging, and feel anxious about it.   (do I work at DARPA?)

    I often set very high goals for myself, and these days let myself off quite easily when I fail them.

    My goals for myself are unrealistically high, and this hurts my performance against the tasks I set before myself.
    I am wildly optomistic when I set goals, and this set me up for failure.
    I have significantly underperformed in my career, and in many things I have set out to do on a personal level.
    My perceived ability level is much above the accomplishments I have to date.
    In my career I have not driven in a straight line long enough to have solid academic or impact accomplishments.
    I do well when a fixed structure is set before me, but poorly in attacking a problem without such a structure.
    I am not sure enough of any particular structure I impose, thus I do not attack with zeal, and I may change 
    goals.

    My expectations are set by my estimation of myself as:
    - very creative in generating novel/practical approaches to problems
    - good in estimating utility of approach??
    - energetic in attacking a problem.  + High ambition.

    Also I want to be strong academically, and managerially, and socially, etc.  I dont' want to tradeoff anything.

    I do not have enough confidence in decisions in such situations, and my reluctance to decide on an approach
    early on, is very detrimental in this situation.

    My need for all possible information before making a decision is also paralyzing.



    GOALS:
    I need to be better at making important decisions.
    I need to not procrastinate important tasks.
    I need to be less anxious about impt decisions and impt tasks.
    I need to work appropriate number of hours and to work effectively.
    I need to take the goals I set much more seriously, and be careful about the goals set.


    SOLUTIONS:
    I need to imposed more structure in my life.
    I need to be less hard on myself (too many goals), and to set realistic goals for myself.  Once set, I must be harder on myself for not making them.
    I need to have clear priorities, and deeply believe in those priorities, and use this to drive action.
    Recognize when I have tasks or decisions that are "at risk" and manage those explicitly.
    Make decisions sooner rather than later.
    Try to make early-tenative decisions, then test those decisions out over a trial period.  Making them more firm by time.



    Current tasks/decisions at risk:
    - do I want kids.
    - mate: elaine
    - IPTO job.
    - ABL paper, sheepdog paper.
    - project direction, who is our customer





    DECISIONS HANGING OVER MY HEAD
    - Go to DARPA
    - Stay with elaine
    -
