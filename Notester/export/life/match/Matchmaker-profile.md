    >TRY TO DESCRIBE THE TYPE OF PERSON YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN MEETING? 
    >EITHER ROMANTICALLY OR PLATONICALLY) 
    >DESCRIBE YOUR PERSONALITY TYPE? WHAT TYPE ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO? 
     
    This questionnaire is *way* too long, here is my wrap up of several questions. 
     
    I'm new to the NYC area and I already love it. I've been hiking in the Hudson valley, catching many shows, rollerblading all over the city, jumping around to the music at several of the clubs here, and doing more museums than my poor feet can stand. I am definitely still a newbie here though--real New Yorkers love the city too, but they try not to let it show on their faces. ;-) 
     
    ADJECTIVES THAT BEST DESCRIBE ME: Positive<<>>Energetic -- The first to want to go out and the last to want to leave. Optimistic<<>>Trusting -- The one people seem to tell those secrets that they have "never told anyone before." Ambitious -- Enjoy pushing myself, and get a bit restless when life's groove gets a little too deep. Thinking -- if I know about it, I have an opinion, and if don't know about it, I want to. 
     
    WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?  I'm new to the area, so in the short term I am looking for interesting new friends.  And in the long term, I guess I am looking for the long term. 
     
     
    >WHAT'S THE FIRST THING OTHERS NOTICE ABOUT YOU? 
    I am enthusiastic; people are quickly comfortable around me. 
     
     
    >WHAT WOULD BE A PERFECT 1ST DATE? WOULD YOU TAKE THE INITIATIVE & PAY? 
    My first matchmaker date would not really be a date, just some short activity that would give us a chance to talk: coffee, lunch, rollerblading, or a museum. 
     
    Who pays is a small thing.  I like the tradition where the guy pays.  Still some feel strongly that more is implied by who pays, in these cases I am happy to split it, trade off, or just say thank you. 
     
     
    >WHERE HAVE YOU MET MOST OF YOUR CURRENT FRIENDS? 
    >IF YOU COULD CHOOSE THE IDEAL FRIEND, WHAT WOULD HE<<>>SHE BE LIKE? 
    Since I am new here, my best friends are those I have met in various places over the last 15 years.  The ideal friend is enthusiastic about life and compassionate about others. 
     
     
    >WHAT TYPE OF WORK DO YOU DO AND ARE YOU ENJOYING IT? FOR HOW LONG? 
    I build concept systems at IBM research.  I love it.  I'm basically free to build what I want!  My first project was an animated panda that reads<<>>listens to a first grade reader--even got to spend multiple weeks "working" in a first grade classroom.  Newer projects include two Internet applications. 
     
    The people I work with are great and occasionally even brilliant.  My only complaint is the truly lame social possibilities there.  Yes they are a bunch of techies.  _I'm_ a techie, but I don't show it on Friday night.  And that's what I want in my friends--I'm just not going to find that kind of person at work. 
     
     
    >FAVORITE PASTIME? HOBBY? DIVERSION? JUST WHAT GOES ON SUNDAYS AT YOUR PLACE? 
    I'm not there, so I hope nothing is happening!  I'm roaming the city, or out of town.  Hobbies?  Outdoor anything; something that lets me learn; something that lets me socialize.  I could list many things here.  Basically I'm into <<>> things.  I'm the one who wears everybody else out--think energizer bunny. 
     
     
    >WHAT COMEDIANS, TV SHOWS OR MOVIES MATCH YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR? ### 
    Seinfeld, The Return of a Taxing Woman. 
     
     
    >NAME SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE SINGERS AND BANDS? WHAT TYPE OF MUSIC DO YOU ENJOY? 
    >DO YOU GO TO CONCERTS <<>> PERFORMANCES? LIST PERFORMANCES YOU HAVE ATTENDED. 
     
    Music really affects my mood, so I listen to it everywhere.  At work, home, car, or rollerblading.  I like the standard fare, so I won't enumerate.  Non-traditional likes include dance (even disco!), female artists with funky voices: Laurie Anderson, Edie Brickell, Christine Lavin. 
     
     
    >WHAT KIND OF MAGAZINES<<>>NEWSPAPERS<<>>BOOKS DO YOU READ? FAVORITE AUTHORS? 
    NPR for news.  Many biographies.  Good fiction (I usually follow friend's recommendations.  Suggestions?) 
     
     
    >WHAT WERE YOUR FAVORITE TOYS AS A CHILD? 
    Gears, pulleys, string, erector, tinker, electric, lego, basically anything you can build. 
     
     
    >WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD WHAT DID YOU HOPE YOU WOULD GROW UP TO BE? 
    Take a wild guess--but hey I did it! 
     
     
    >WHAT WERE YOUR FAVORITE SUBJECTS IN SCHOOL? 
    >WHERE DID YOU ATTEND HIGH SCHOOL AND <<>> OR COLLEGE? 
    Ohio State (Masters), Univ of Illinois (Ph.D.). 
     
     
    >IF YOU HAVE ANY PETS, WHAT ARE THEY AND WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?  ### 
    I've had dogs all my life, but it's hard to be good to a dog in this city. 
     
     
    >WHAT PERSONAL HABITS OF OTHERS REALLY IRRITATE YOU? 
    It's hard to annoy me, but extremely poor personal hygiene can do it. 
     
     
    >WHAT *IS* 'SEXY'? 
    Great question!  The understated cosmopolitan look--confident, chic, and sexy!  (Insensitivity to others--not sexy.) 
     
     
    >WHICH VIRTUES GIVE YOU MOST OF YOUR SELF CONFIDENCE? 
    I think fast on my feet and I am extroverted--both work well in many situations. 
     
     
    >WHAT DO YOU THINK CAUSED YOUR PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP <<>> MARRIAGE TO FAIL? 
    Physical distance ended it (Nothing was wrong, it just wasn't "the one.") 
     
     
    >IF YOU COULD CHANGE ONE THING ABOUT YOURSELF, WHAT WOULD IT BE? 
    ### NOTHING 
    <<>> get to change anything?  Ok, I would turn the volume up on my  
    <<>> (all the way to eleven).  I'm a bright guy, but alas  
    <<>> probably wont be changing the course of human thought. 
     
    I would be more compassionate, and giving.  It is in my nature, but not always in my actions; sometimes I let petty details of life absorb more of my energy than they deserve. 
     
    >WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY? 
    A surprise party with everyone's there (I've gotten it once or twice.  I've got some great friends!) 
     
    >YOU HAVE JUST WON A STATE LOTTERY FOR $115 MILLION. (IT COULD HAPPEN!) 
    >WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH IT? AND WHERE? 
    I'd give a chunk to charity, and to my parents.  I'd quit work, I'd live large, and I'd travel the world!  Ok, *that* would last six months on the outside; then I'd have to do something!  Hmmm, perhaps I would use that cash to start and manage a foundation.   (Yes, this would let put my money where my mouth is, since I already think I know how the world should be run. :-) ) 
     
     
    >IF YOU COULD PICK ONE SUPER-HUMAN POWER (SUCH AS COMIC-BOOK CHARACTERS HAVE) 
    >WHAT WOULD YOU CHOOSE? 
    Immortality.  No maybe not, but I could easily go with ten lifetimes--yeah, that should do it. 
     
     
    >WHAT PART OF THE TRI-STATE AREA DO YOU LIVE IN ? (BE SPECIFIC) 
    It's complicated.  I live in Stamford on weekdays.  I work in Yorktown NY, and I live on the Upper West Side on weekends. 
     
     
    >WHERE WERE YOU BORN? LIST SOME OF THE PLACES YOU HAVE LIVED. 
    Cincinnati Ohio, San Jose California, Champaign Illinois, New York. 
     
     
    >WHERE ON EARTH HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN TO THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO VISIT? 
    I could reel off a huge list of places, but basically if I haven't been there, I'm game. 
     
     
    >WHAT IS YOUR ETHNIC ORIGIN OR ANCESTRY? 
    A mutt: German, Swiss, Irish, American Indian, etc. 
     
     
    >WHAT COLOGNE/PERFUME GETS YOUR ATTENTION THE QUICKEST?   
    A perfume worn lightly on your neck & collar, only to be detected occasionally when others lean to say something, etc.  Very sexy! 
     
     
    >HAVE YOU EVER ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING THAT GOT YOUR NAME ON TELEVISION, 
    >RADIO, IN A MAGAZINE OR NEWSPAPER? WHAT WAS IT YOU DID? 
    I was five, and on the "Uncle Al Show."  Mom says I was pretty cute wiggling my butt to the tunes they were playing.  Of course moms are supposed to think that. 
     
     
    >WHICH SPORTS DO YOU ENJOY PARTICIPATING IN OR WATCHING? 
    Sports watched: none.  Doing: Many, many.  This summer I have been rock climbing (in door only :-( ), rollerblading (weekly), kayaking, water skiing and waking boarding (just bought one!), back packing in Oregon and in Northern NY. 
     
    My idea of sports is rock climbing or racquetball, <<>> softball or Monday night football. 
    >WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR LIFELONG GOALS? WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE TOMORROW? 
    >WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE IN 2 YEARS? IN 5 YEARS? 
     
    TOMORROW: Here. 
     
    TWO YEARS: Possible futures: In a high-tech startup, a faculty position, or in industrial research (I'm there already.)    
     
    FIVE YEARS: Married.  I hope to find someone to match my loyalty, energy, and optimism. 
     
     
    >IF YOU COULD 'DO LUNCH' WITH ANYONE, LIST A FEW. 
    Jesus.  No I am not a religious freak, but hey what other single person has made a comparable impact.  (Plus I'd get stinking rich off the TV rights.) 
     
     
    >WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LEAVE SOUR CREAM OUT... DOES IT "GO GOOD"? 
    I am a good boy; I don't know anything about what bad cremes do. 
     
     
    >ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS? IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT YOU THAT THE  
    >QUESTIONNAIRE DIDN'T COVER? 
     
    Plenty, but I'm not going to do any better here.  Face it, some of what makes people click as friends or partners can be put into words, but a lot of it cannot.  So the best plan is to look at the profiles, chat a bit by mail, and then meet over coffee early on.  In the worst case we both have a new acquaintance, and in the best case, well you just never know, right?

    >DO YOU (OR DID YOU) PLAY ANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS? LIST THEM. WHAT LEVEL? 
    <<>> once upon a time I was a novice at best.

    <<>> music with a good beat.  (skip the DJs) 
     
    >WHAT'S PRINTED ON YOUR FAVORITE T-SHIRT? 
    <<>> 
     
     
    >WHAT *IS* 'SEXY'?  ### 
    Great question!  The confidence and chic of the understated cosmopolitan look, but I am very turned off by the insincerity and superficiality that can go with this.  What is sexy?  Cosmopolitan looks, intellectual or global perspective, and Midwest sincerity--like me!  ;-) 
     
     
     
     
    >DO YOU BELONG TO ANY ORGANIZATIONS/CLUBS/TEAMS? SPECIAL INTERESTS 
             groups?
