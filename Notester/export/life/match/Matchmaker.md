    >TRY TO DESCRIBE THE TYPE OF PERSON YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN MEETING? 
    > (EITHER ROMANTICALLY OR PLATONICALLY) DESCRIBE YOUR PERSONALITY TYPE?  
    > WHAT TYPE ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO? 
     
    These questionaires are *way* too long, here is my wrapup of several. 
     
    I'm new to the NYC area and I already love it. I've been hiking in the Hudson valley, catching many shows, rollerblading all over the city, jumping around to the music at several of the clubs here, and doing more museums than my poor feet can stand. I am definitely still a newbie here though---real New Yorkers love the city too, but they try not to let it show on their faces. :o) 
     
    ADJECTIVES THAT BEST DESCRIBE ME: Positive<<>>Energetic -- The first to want to go out and the last to want to leave. Optimistic<<>>Trusting -- The one people seem to tell those secrets that they have "never told anyone before." Ambitious -- Enjoy pushing myself, and get a bit restless when life's groove gets a little too deep. Thinking -- if I know about it, I have an opinion, and if don't know about it, I want to. 
     
    WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR? I'm new to the area, so in the short term I am looking for interesting new friends.  And in the long term, I guess I am looking for the long term. 
     
    >WHAT'S THE FIRST THING OTHERS NOTICE ABOUT YOU? 
     
    I am enthusiastic.  People are quickly comfortable around me. 
     
    >WHAT WOULD BE A PERFECT 1ST DATE? WOULD YOU TAKE THE INITIATIVE & PAY? 
    My first matchmaker date would not really be a date--just some short activity that would give us a chance to talk: coffee, lunch, rollerblading, or a museum. 
     
    Who pays is a small thing.  I like the tradition where the guy pays. 
    Still some feel strongly that more is implied by who pays, in these 
    cases I am happy to split it, trade off, or just say thank you. 
     
     
    >WHERE HAVE YOU MET MOST OF YOUR CURRENT FRIENDS? 
    >IF YOU COULD CHOOSE THE IDEAL FRIEND, WHAT WOULD HE<<>>SHE BE LIKE? 
     
    Since I am new here, my best friends are those I have met in various 
    places over the last 15 years.  The ideal friend is enthusiastic about 
    life and compasionate about others. 
     
     
    >WHAT TYPE OF WORK DO YOU DO AND ARE YOU ENJOYING IT? FOR HOW LONG? 
     
    I have been developing prototypes at IBM research for about a year.  I 
    really love it!  They let me build what I want!  My first project was 
    an animated panda that reads<<>>listens to a first grade reader--even got 
    to spend multiple weeks "working" in the classroom.  Newer 
    projects include two internet applications. 
     
    I really can't imagine a better job!  The people I work with are  
    great and occasionally even brilliant.  My only complaint is the  
    truly lame social possibilities there.  Yes they are a bunch of techies. 
    _I'm_ a techie, but I don't show it on Friday nite.  And that's what I want 
    in my friends--I'm just not going to find that kind of person at work. 
     
     
    >FAVORITE PASTIME? HOBBY? DIVERSION? JUST WHAT GOES ON SUNDAYS AT YOUR PLACE? 
     
    At home nothing is happening (I hope).  I'm always roaming the city, 
    or out of town.  Hobbies?  Outdoor anything, see sports.  I could list 
    many many things here.  Basically I'm into <<>> things.  I'm the 
    one who generally wears everybody else out--think energizer bunny. 
     
     
    >LIST SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE LINES FROM MOVIES <<>> POEMS <<>> SONGS. 
     
    The true measure of your worth is how much you would be worth if you lost all of your money. 
     
     
    >NAME SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE SINGERS AND BANDS?  WHAT TYPE OF MUSIC DO YOU 
    >ENJOY? DO YOU GO TO CONCERTS <<>> PERFORMANCES?   LIST PERFORMANCES YOU HAVE  
    >ATTENDED. 
     
    Music really affects my mood, so I listen to it everywhere.  At work, 
    home, car, rollerblading, just walking the city.  I like the standard 
    fare, so I won't enumerate.  Non-traditional likes include: Dance 
    (even disco!), Female artists with funky voices: Laurie Anderson, Edi 
    Brichel, Christine Lavin 
     
     
    >WHAT KIND OF MAGAZINES<<>>NEWSPAPERS<<>>BOOKS DO YOU READ? FAVORITE AUTHORS? 
     
    NPR for news.  Many biographies. 
     
     
    >WHAT WERE YOUR FAVORITE TOYS AS A CHILD? 
     
    Gears, pulleys, string, erector, tinker, electric, lego, basically anything you can build. 
     
     
    >WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD WHAT DID YOU HOPE YOU WOULD GROW UP TO BE? 
     
    Take a wild guess--but hey I did it! 
     
     
    >IF YOU HAVE ANY PETS, WHAT ARE THEY AND WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES? 
     
    Dogs all my life, but none now.  :-( 
     
     
    >WHAT PERSONAL HABITS OF OTHERS REALLY IRRITATE YOU? 
     
    I am hard to annoy, but extremely poor personal hygeine can do it. 
     
     
    >WHAT *IS* 'SEXY'?   
     
    Great question!  I am attracted to the confidence and chic of the understated cosmopolitan look, but I am very turned off by the incencerity and superficiality that can go with this.  What is sexy? cosmopolitan looks, intellectual perspective, and midwest sincerity--like me!  ;-) 
     
     
    >WHICH VIRTUES GIVE YOU MOST OF YOUR SELF CONFIDENCE? 
     
    I think fast on my feet and I am extroverted--both work well in many situations. 
     
    >WHAT DO YOU THINK CAUSED YOUR PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP <<>> MARRIAGE TO FAIL? 
     
    Physical distance ended it.  (Nothing was wrong, it just wasn't "the one") 
     
             If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be? 
    Another great question. ### 
     
     
             What would you like for your birthday? 
    A surprise party with everyone's there (I've gotten this once or twice.  It's 
    great to have great friends!) 
     
             You have just won a state lottery for $115 million. (It could happen!) 
             What would you do with it? And where? 
    Buy my parent a new house, and give them the cash to retire.  I'd 
    quit work, buy a couple of everything I can think of buying, and travel  
    the world! 
     
    I give myself six months at the outside, then I'd have to do something 
    productive.  Perhaps I would use that cash to start a foundation. 
    I already think I know how the world should be run :-) 
     
             What's your dream car and its color? 
    The Roadster is sweet machine, purple. 
     
     
             If you could pick one super-human power (such as comic-book 
             characters have)  what would you choose? 
    Immortality.  No maybe not, but I could easily go with ten 
    lifetimes--yeah, that should do it. 
     
     
             What part of the Tri-State area do you live in ? (be specific) 
    It's complicated.  I live in Stamford on weekdays.  I work in Yorktown NY, and 
    I live on the Upper west side on weekends. 
     
     
             Where were you born? List some of the places you have lived. 
    Cincinnati Ohio, San Jose California, Champaign Illinois, New York. 
     
     
             Where on earth have you never been to that you would like to visit? 
    I could reel off a huge list of places, but basically if I haven't 
    been there, I'm game. 
     
     
             What is your ethnic origin or ancestry? 
    A mutt: German, Swiss, Irish, American Indian, etc. 
     
     
             What cologne/perfume gets your attention the quickest?   
    A perfume worn lightly on your neck & colar, only to be detected 
    occasionally when others lean to say something, etc.  Very sexy! 
     
     
             Have you ever accomplished anything that got your name on television, 
             radio, in a magazine or newspaper? What was it you did? 
    I was five, and on the "Uncle Al Show."  Mom says I was pretty cute 
    wiggling my butt to the tunes they were playing.  Of course moms are 
    supposed to think that. 
     
     
             Do you belong to any organizations/clubs/teams? Special interests 
             groups? 
    Professional organizations. 
     
             Which sports do you enjoy participating in or watching? 
    Watching: None.  Doing: Many, many.  This summer I have been rock climing 
    (in door only :-( ), rollerblading (weekly), kayaking, water skiing 
    and waking boarding (just bought one!), back packing in Oregon and in  
    Northern NY. 
     
    My idea of sports is Rock climbing or Racquet ball, <<>> softball or 
    Monday nite football. 
     
             What are some of your lifelong goals? Where would you like to be 
             tomorrow? 
             Where would you like to be in 2 years? In 5 years? 
    TOMORROW: Where I am today.   
    TWO YEARS: Possible futures: In a high-tech startup, a Faculty 
    position, or in industrial research (I'm there already) 
    FIVE YEARS: In a committed marriage, between two energetic and 
    ambitious professionals, who use this energy to ensure their ambition 
    does not infring on their marriage. 
     
     
             What do you have hiding under your bed ? 
    Whoa, now that is none of your buisness! 
     
             If you could 'Do Lunch' with anyone, list a few. 
    Jesus.  No I am not a religious freak, but hey what other single person 
    has made a comparable impact.  (Plus I'd get stinking rich off the TV rights.) 
     
     
             Do you (or did you) play any musical instruments? List them. What 
             level? 
    Piano once upon a time.  I was a novice at best. 
     
     
             What happens if you leave sour cream out... does it "go good"? 
    The good boy that I am, I would no nothing of bad cremes. 
     
     
             What types of BBS do you subscribe to? What do you require in a BBS? 
    Life is simply too short for a BBS. 
     
     
             Any additional comments? Is there anything about you that the 
             questionnaire didn't cover? 
     
    Plenty, but I'm not going to do any better here.  Face it, some of 
    what makes people click as friends or partners can be put into words, 
    but a lot of it cannot.  So the best plan is to match up the profiles, 
    chat a bit online, then meet over coffee early.  In the worst case we 
    both have a new aquaintance, and in the best case, well you just never 
    know... right?
