    !!POW!!   
     
    That's what I am looking for. 
     
    You have had it happen to you, you are doing your thing, you meet 
    someone and then POW! 
     
    It's a great thing, it's a random thing--we can't plan it, but it wont  
    happen if we're not meeting people. 
     
    I just finished grad school and moved here; I am meeting people every 
    way I can.  This is a great city for it, there is so much I want to do 
    that is naturally done with others. 
     
    Things that I am currently doing: rollerblading, 
    rollerblading, I love rollerblading.  Museums of course.  Coffee shops 
    or the beach, anywhere I can watch people, chat, and read a good book. 
    Some dancing, the clubs here are fun.  Outdoor anything, this summer I 
    have gone kyaking, rock climbing (indoor only :-\ ), water skiing + 
    waking boarding (just bought one), camping (backpacking in Oregon, and 
    in northern NY). 
     
    Enough of what I do, now I'll tell you who I am: Many profiles contain 
    a long list of adjectives, unfortunately it always seems that they are 
    the same list!  So I am only listing the three that *best* describe 
    me.  Ambitious/Energetic: I strive to lead a life both, career and 
    personal, that is not complacent.  Academic: I love learning, 
    discussing, debating any topic--politics, art, social issues, the 
    internet, anything!  (I work for IBM doing research on the internet 
    and the classroom)  Caring/Loyal: thoughtful action is the basis any 
    deep relationship, frendship or otherwise.  I really prize my close 
    relationships, and I work for them. 
     
    I believe that likes attract so I am looking for someone who also fits 
    this profile.  I am also looking for a certain chemistry; its difficult  
    to convey by email, but my experience is that you usually know if there 
    is potential for it once you meet a person. 
     
    Ok so here is the plan: if you have read this and it seems like we fit, then 
    lets meet--just for a quick coffee, a museum, or a loop around central park. 
     
    What is the worse that could happen?  A 45min conversation between two 
    people who have no real basis for friendship or anything else.  And 
    the best?  Well...  POW!

    .  Some of what I am looking for is a certain energy that 
    is difficult to convey with email 
     
     
    , so if after an email or two it seems that we might fit then we should meet--just for a quick coffee, 
    a museum, or a loop around central park.
