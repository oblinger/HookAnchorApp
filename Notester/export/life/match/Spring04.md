    Rollin' The Dice Of Life

    Loving New York.  I am still new enough to be excited about all there is
    to see and do:  Foreign films, ethnic food, rollerblading, clubbing, 
    New York has it all. 

    HOW ABOUT YOU?  Do you have strong intellectual interests?  
    very energetic?  in good shape?   well then read on maybe we are a match.

    ADJECTIVES THAT BEST DESCRIBE ME:
    I am 5'10", 165lbs physically fit, and clean cut.
    Energetic/Optimistic -- The first to want to go out and the last to want to leave.
    Thinking -- I have a life long passion for learning, and am always up for a good debate.
    Trusting/Spiritual -- The one people seem to tell those secrets they have "never told anyone before."
    Ambitious -- Just a bit.  I'd like my travel through this world to have some (positive) impact on it.

    During the 9 to 5 I am an inventor for IBM, and I occasionally teach courses at Columbia University.
    My job is flexible (and about an hour north of NYC) so many days you will find me working from a coffee shop
    in the city.

    Do my adjectives sound like your adjectives?  If so, drop me a line.  If you are like me, we will have a fun time,
    and well who knows, right?
