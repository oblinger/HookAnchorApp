# life.78\_Alive --


    The questions to answer:
    - Do I feel alive with this person?
    - Do I want to build a life with this person?

    * I have been sitting on the fence in a completely unproductive place:
      Either I start today building a life forever with Elaine or I break up.
      - Building the life is the best way to see if it will/wont work
      - Foot in the wont work camp does little and costs much
      - Living from NYC, parties as if we are a WE
      - Solving the bed issue
      - Knowing the answer to kids and where we can live
      -

    DETAILS

    - Used to ask: will I find someone beyond elaine?
    - Used to ask: Is this really a best person for me?
    Well they are not the central questions.  To the first, the answer is probably yes, and in any case 
    ya gotta try, since staying for that reason will cause much trouble.  To the second question, it doesn't matter
    mostly your happiness will be built around your commitment to building a life with her.

    ------
    Half of me is preping for leaving elaine, while I ask if I should stay!
    It makes no sense, since I really cant prep much, and it blocks my thinking.
    I should be preping to live the rest of my life with her, and if that breaks, well then it should be.
