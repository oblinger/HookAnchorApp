    here is a letter I wrote about who I hang out with


    > Maybe we could meet with some friends next week?

    Just used for access to my friends  ;-)
    Truly that is quite ok.  New York is quite a challenging place to 
    make solid and deep connections, we should all look to opportunities
    when they present themselves.  I think the easiest is for you to join
    in with some of my friends at some event, or for me to join in with 
    yours.  If we find groups that match we try the more ambitious merging
    of the groups.  Somehow I seem to be able to thrive within almost *any* 
    group of people, so I am not so worried about it.  If the group has
    interesting conversation, I am happy to be there.

    Below I will tell you about some of the groups of people I hang out with.  
    They are somewhat diverse, you would be welcome at each, but what they 
    do is different, so you have to think about how you want to fit in.


    (1) I go out for late nite dancing most weeks with a younger group (27-31).
    We are going out tonight, though My Luu and I have not settled on a place yet.  The regulars:  'My' is *very* outgoing and energetic (she is the female version of me, although she claims I am the somewhat more tame
    male version of her... she could be right)

    Other regulars in this group include Aichin.  she is a circuit designer at
    IBM research, but you would never guess this.  She is gorgeous very fashionable and trendy.  Her boyfriend is in Canada, she is always ready
    to find some late nite party or music.  Kyle is a regular too.  He is getting his PhD. from Rutgers... we picked him up when I arrived at a
    venue too early.....  we just got talking, and now he joins us when we go out.  My is an HR manager at IBM, so she is always bringing along other
    (usually male) IBM researchers.  In many cases though they are younger
    24-30.

    This is a high energy group I hang with regularly.
    We will be going out tonight, and they are really open to new people.


    (2)  I have a core group of pretty close friends from IBM.  this is an older
    crowd.  (32-35, with a few late '20s)  Maybe this crowd just feels older.
    They all have PhD.  we go out for dinners, cosy gatherings, or cultural events.  We are all big into Indy/Foreign films, and Sabine (French) is 
    on top of the film scene so we get to the "good" stuff.  
    I think this group matches your personality well, and the next time we
    go out for a wine tasting or such I will invite you along.  They are
    all amused by my Match.com adventures, and would enjoy ribbing my
    about the fish that got away, so you would be welcomed there as well.

    The real problem is that I have been so busy playing the 'Dating' game
    that I have not done as much with the group in recent days.  The
    group is slowing down the number of things it does as well (two new
    babies have been born to mothers in the group).  Still I will keep
    you in mind.


    (3)  A close friend of mine (who left for paris) graduate from Fordam
    university.  I am now friends with his Fordam university class.  They 
    are all lawyers, but are a pretty energetic bunch.  They invite me along
    when they go for drinks, or b-day parties etc.


    (4)  My DT.UT coffee shop crowd.  I hang at a coffee shop so much that
    I really have a loose group of friends there.  Ages are quite diverse, 
    sometimes I go out w. them, but its not a cohesive group.  


    (5)  Social circles.   you can go to socialcircles.com to see what they
    do.  I would be happy to bring you along as a guest.  Everyone is quite
    friendly and the events are interesting.
    Because it is more $$.  these people are mostly professionals.


    (6)  thelunchclub.net  you can go there online too.  Rafah (friend from group number #2) and I sometimes join this group on their outings. 
    they are low key and friendly.  you meet people from *all* walks of life here.

    Wow!  kind of scary when I see it written out this way.  I should save
    this email, as a kind of diary entry for this portion of my life!
    I am not certain what you are really looking for, but I'd love to help
    if I can, in having you find it.  My number one choice for you is group
    #2, all though #1, #5, and #6 are really fun too.  


    I can't really tell what you are thinking, but I would like to help if I can.  As I said before I am also very up for hanging with your friends as well.  I know that for every though you express, there are 1000 others, so I would also like to hang out for a dinner just the two of us.  I'm not a professional, but I am going to do my best to figure out exactly what is going on inside Dina's head  :-)

    Seriously I do hope that we can meet up for dinner in addition to other activities.


    Ciao,
    Dan

    P.S. you wrote one line, I replied with 4 pages! what a big mouth.
    P.P.S I forwarded this to my best friend in D.C.  she will be amused.
