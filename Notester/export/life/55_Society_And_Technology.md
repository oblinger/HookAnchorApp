    TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS:
    To a first order approximation, the technology available to a modern society is a monotonically increasing
    set of alternatives for accomplishing and increasing collection of tasks.

    RADICAL SHIFTS:
    Tech progress occasionally produces alternatives that are many folds cheaper than prior technology.

    MARKET ECONOMIES:
    With some exceptions noted below, 
    Market economies always adopt the alternatives available with the lower costs.

    INCREASING WEALTH:
    As a consequence a fixed population of citizens are able to produce and every increasing 
    quantity of goods.  The average citizen is getting monotonically richer.

    THE VALUE OF WEALTH:
    Happiness is related to wealth in some ways.  For simplicity let us consider only two:
    (1) Relative wealth.  Consider the value obtained from a 70" HD Plasma screen TV relative
        to the value obtained from a 12" b&w portable TV.  It is much higher in the sense
        that people are willing to pay x100 times as much for the former.  But it is a relative
        happiness their was a time with the 12 b&w TV cost as much as the 70" HD today.
        Yet it no longer brings the happiness that it once did.  Its value is relative to 
        ones expectations from the goods accumulated by your peers in society.
        Thus as relative wealth increase, overall happiness in that society does not increase,
        since it is always measured against the average of the society itself.
    (1) Absolute wealth.  Consider, on the other hand, a technology that eliminates a very painful disease.
        The increase in obtained happiness is connected to that level of removed pain, not
        expectations from others.  Increases in the absolute wealth of a society does increase the 
        average happiness of its members.

    PERPONDERANCE OF RELATIVE WEALTH:
    - Technology that relates to resources necessary for survival and healthy life are generally absolute forms of wealth.
    - Technology that moves beyond strict survival and creature comforts are generally relative forms of wealth.

    Once a society solves basic survivability and creature comfort issues further improvements will not increase overall happiness
    based on the goods produced, since they are predominantly relative wealth.

       (this is stated a bit more strongly than I believe, but you get the gist)





    ========

    JOB SATISFACTION:
    Another important source of satisfaction and happiness in life is the satisfaction obtained from one's occupation.


    VALUE OF JOB SATISFACTION:
    The happiness obtained from ones job is very difficult to quantify, nonetheless I believe it is a function of at least these
    two factors:
    (1) Society's estimation of the value of the goods produced.  (People want to do something that matters)
    (2) Characteristics of the performance task itself.  The repetitiveness of working on an assembly line, for example,  reduces the generated happiness
        even if the products produced have great value.

    JOBS AVAILABLE:
    Both parameters above are a function of the specific jobs that an individual has.  The job that individual has must come
    from the set of jobs available in that society.  But the jobs available are NOT related to the desires of the workers, 
    rather they are entirely dictated by technologies employed by that society, and we saw above that
    technologies employed is dictated by market forces: they are those jobs associated with the most efficient methods available at the time.

    OUR WORLD AS A MACHINE
      Well which jobs does technology favor?
    * Market forces drive innovation toward those alternatives with a perceived potential for high return on investment.
    * Discovered technology determines most efficient methods, which in turn dictates jobs available, which in turn effects (determines?)
      potential job satisfaction for society's citizens.

    POWERLESSNESS OF THE CITZENRY
    Of course people may be powerless to improve their society because they cannot predict the outcome of any particular decision on 
    overall happiness.   But the reasoning above describes a situation that is far worse than this:

    Even if *all* members of a society agree that Job, Jx, obtained from technology, Tx, is much prefer to job, Jy, from tech, Ty,
    *and* all members realize that the improvement in wealth obtained is a relative improvement that does not
    increase overall happiness, the market economy will *still* select Ty and Jy assuming it is the more efficient option.

    Why?

    Members of that society are part of a very large prisoner's dilemma.  My ownership happiness is a relative happiness--it is
    based on my expectations based on what others own.  *My* happiness *will* improve if I purchase products based on technology Ty, 
    since I can buy more.  But once all others make the same choice, our happiness will be reduced to previous (since we all have plasma
    screen TVs together).  The only difference is now people who used to enjoy job Jx have forcibly lost their job, to be replaced
    by a lesser job Jy.  They loose.  And incrementally as a society we all loose.

    So notice the citizens all still loose, even if they have perfect knowledge regarding the detrimental consequences of their technological choices.


    THE BIG CONCLUSION
        Members of a market economy society have very little ability to control the job satisfaction available to its citizens.
        Job satisfaction will wander based on the whims of tech choices, which are being made w/o *any* consideration for the jobs
        they will generate.

    This does not mean that things are definitely going to get worse, only that we have no control
    over whether things get better or worse.


         -- in a separate thread, I can outline why I fear that the forces involved *will* result in 
            drastically reduce job sat in the long run. 

         -- my biggest fear of all is that global production will continue to increase, while the fraction of the 
            population that can meaningfully contribute to that production will decrease.  In this world
            I wonder how fulfilled these people will be, even if their creature comforts are cared for.




    THE EXCEPTIONS
       (here are some reasons that counter this trend.  My feeling is that they are not strong enough
        to do anything but slow the trend)

    -  To a limited degree, worker preference can be expressed in a willingness to accept a lower wage.
       If two technologies are available for the same task, but one leads to much higher job satisfaction.  
       Workers will naturally select the preferred technology, even if they must compete against the 
       less preferred alternative through accepting a lower salary.
       Sadly the existence of radical shifts in efficiency make this an option that only works for a limited period of time
       prior to such a radical shift.  One cannot accept a wage many folds or orders of magnitude less than 
       the best alternative, since that worker is still subjected to the issue of relative wealth.
       They will be disappointed with the 12" b&w TV that is all they can afford, since others have a 70" plasma.

    -  The second factor is the inherent value people place on human labor.  Once creature comforts are covered, 
       people will develop additional needs.  As the price of mass produces items drops to zero the relative wealth
       they represent also drops to zero.  Items produced by human labor *may* increase in relative value
       in part because they cannot be mass produced.  by definition a human can only produce 1 human years labor
       per year,  so an item like a hand woven rug may increase in value dramatically relative to the "equivalent" mass produced
       alternative.  This may allow some jobs types to remain even with much more efficient alternatives are developed.
