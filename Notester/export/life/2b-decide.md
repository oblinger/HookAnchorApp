    MY STATE OF MIND 
     
    > Most of my life I have been optimistic, capable, and energetic 
      - Recently (last 6 months) I feel something has changed, 
        I feel old, unhappy, and overwhelmed 
      - Independent of my troubles with Yoshiko, things are not 
        happening in my career as they need to in order for to move forward. 
      - Quite surprisingly I am having trouble making myself care 
        enough about my work, to really work hard. 
      - I don't seem to want to do all the social things that used to  
        mean so much to me. 
     
      I don't know if I am just "growing up" and getting a more realistic 
      set of expectations, or if I am temporarily unhappy because of my 
      troubles at work and with my girlfriend. 
     
     
    > I am very stuck, and get little done these days. 
      - I am not happy, have trouble sleeping thru the night 
      - I now recognize that I have a problem taking a risk, whether it 
        is leaving someone, or marrying someone, and I have hurt myself 
        because of this. 
     
     
    > I feel I have trapped myself into being with Yoshiko 
      * I am too old to find a non married mate 
      * I am feeling too tired and overwhelmed to start over 
      * I feel very bad to leave her now  (she is getting too old to have kids) 
      * I have spent the last 1.5 years thinking that I should not be with her 
     
     
    > Am I a "SERIAL DATER" that will never be satisfied? 
      * For much of my dating life I felt it was too early to be serious, 
        and I did not think I would marry many that I dated. 
      * In two other relationships before Yoshiko that I did not feel would 
        lead to marriage, but I stayed. 
      * I feel things are different now, that I could meet someone after  
        Yoshiko, and happily marry them (but I question if I am fooling myself 
        given my track record) 
     
     
    > I have grown to love Yoshiko, and do have a connection to her 
      * I have never be "in love" with her 
     
    > I feel like a ship that has battered itself against the rocks, by 
      sailing too close to shore during a storm. 
     
     
     
    ------------------------------ 
     
    > HOW DO WE FIT AS A COUPLE?  Pluses and Minuses 
      + She is very devoted to me (and in love with me) 
        and I love her, and feel connected to her (not exactly "in love" w. her) 
      + We get along on a day-to-day basis 
      + Yoshiko is a naturally happy/contented person (people like her) 
      + She is independent and allows me to be independent too 
      + She is religious (though not deeply so) 
       
      - Intellectual mismatch 
      - Energy and Activities 
      - Physically/sexually 
      - I am holding Back 
     
     
    > INTELLECTUAL CONNECTION 
      - I enjoy taking a analytical perspective on many topics ranging 
        from movies we have seen, the world (politics), books, art, 
        work, life, gossip about others, etc.   
      - She is not someone I can share these discussions with, 
        we really don't have alot to talk about.  (but am I expecting 
        too much here?  maybe most couples don't have much to talk about?) 
     
     
    > ENERGY LEVEL AND ACTIVITIES 
      - I imagine myself with someone who views life as a bit of an adventure, 
        and brings new experiences to our relationship.  I find myself bored 
        when I am with her, and talk with others rather than her when in a group. 
      - We don't have common interests or common discussion topics. 
      - She is content with less (e.g., wants to nap her Saturdays away) 
      - We have an English/Japanese language barrier.   
      - She is not as social as I am 
     
     
    > PHYSICALLY/SEXUALLY 
      Sexually we have some chemistry, but we have difficulties too: 
      * I am not strongly sexually attracted to her. 
      * She is not very giving sexually. 
     
      I am particularly attracted to a general body type  
      * Petite frame; somewhat stylishly dresser. 
        (Some Asians fit this type, but not in Yoshiko's case.) 
      * I don't know if it is right for me to care about this, but 
        if I am honest with myself, I do have a 'type' that I am particularly 
        attracted to. 
     
     
    > I AM HOLDING BACK 
      I have been "holding back" in this relationship. 
      I have never felt like we match,  I never loved to just sit and talk. 
      (but I have felt like I didn't match other girlfriends too, though not 
       as much as I do now.) 
     
    It is embarrassing to admit that I have had two relationships in my 30s that 
    have lasted 3 years, and during the second two years in both cases I felt 
    that they were not a match, but I didn't break it off, or commit to it. 
    When I look at it, I realize that I have a problem here.  I think I can fix 
    it, but it is a problem. 
     
     
    Just to add more confusion: For most of the time that I have been 
    dating my girlfriend, I had a roommate who is a long time friend. 
    This ex-roomate *is* the type of person that I would imagine being 
    with.  I told her this two years ago, but she was not interested in me 
    romantically.  It is good that I am no longer her roommate, but it 
    still makes me aware of what kind of relationship is possible. 
     
     
     
       
    - I am 37.5, and worry that the kind of balanced, confident, energetic persons  
      I have described are not available, or are too much younger than me. 
    - In the last six months I am not feeling balanced myself, and I wonder 
      if I would be attractive to the type to a confident energetic person. 
      (I don't even seem to have the energy I have had all my life.) 
    - I wonder if I have a "fantasy" about who I will be with, and am 
      focusing on some of the wrong things. 
     
     
    Thanks much rick for looking at this, and I look forward to talking tomorrow.
