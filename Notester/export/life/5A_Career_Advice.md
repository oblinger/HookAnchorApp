    Arkady,

    My ECML paper was actually accepted as a presentation not a poster.
    I just couldn't get to the conference.... too many things happening.

    I joined DARPA, not because I could not do reserach at IBM, but
    rather because of what I can potentially do at DARPA.
    I hope to create a pretty exciting reserach agenda whose scope
    is too big to do at any lab (or anywhere else really).  We will see.....


    That said, I do think the focus of research labs is changing.
    IBM research has hit a tough patch, not clear how that will
    change the lab.

    Generally it seems that, the day of large labs that give many researchers
    wide ranging freedom to persue anything they want are over.
    If your goal is to publish like crazy, and to have the biggest possible
    impact on some academic community, well academia is the place to be.
    That said, you have to get yourself into one of the stronger universities
    if you want to attract funding dollars and smart hard working graduate students.
    It is an uphill climb, since there are few such jobs each year.

    On the other hand, your next three-four years are critical if you ever want
    to go down that path.  New Ph.D. are definitely favored in that game.
    Getting the best postdoc publish publish publish.   Coordinate conferences, etc.
    Land that sweet job, and make sure you get tenure.


    while I do think that academia is the place to be, in some ways.  I have having
    a great time in industry.  There is energy in the world that I live in, and there
    is movement.  Being at DARPA is *so* different than what I did before.
    pushing the crank on our economies innovation machine can be exciting
    if you value that output.  (if you don't value that output, you will often
    feel that you are not doing "real" research.  This is the chief compaint
    of the folks in a place like IBM.  There lives are quite cushie, but
    doing the things that push techology into the next IBM product, is not
    the same a writing the next journal article....)
