# life.5A\_Elaine --


    ===========================================
    5<<>>12<<>>2009 -- back from Hopkins Ordinary

    Written before:  the simple truths.

    - With Elaine I am starting below zero on one dimension:  warmth
    - With Elaine there are many differences in interests, energy, clothing<<>>style, confidence
    - 

    - The most impt aspect of a relationship is willingness of both to work at it.
      Elaine and I do have that going for us.


    ===========================================
    3<<>>10<<>>2009 -- back from offsite in San Diego

    WANT?  After all of the disiderata of life and work are done, what to I really want?
    to do with my time, my energy, my life?
     - Want to work efficiently and energetically on disiderata to clear room beyond it, first.
     - This approach is dangerous 'cause I never get done.
     - Need to focus and limit such work.  
     - My thinking, use following states:  Play, Piddle, Cranking

    BUT THEN AFTER?
    - The question:  how many hours each day am I really alive?
    - I am after the rest of the picture:
      - Connection with others
      - Experiencing this world


    ===========================================
    2<<>>26<<>>2009 -- after talking with Vik

    Some points of clarity:

    (1) NOT BROKEN.  Yes I have had my head up my ass, but I am fundamentally not broken.
        I will make an appropriate decision wrt to Elaine, and later in life I will make
        appropriate decisions then too.  (And even if I dont make correct decisions, the 
        best approach is to move forward trying to make the best decisions at the moment 
        under the assumption that this decision and all future decsions will be well made.  
        I will try to learn along the way, but keep moving, and keep trusting in my
        core capability to get it right.)

    (2) NOT TOO LATE.  Yes, my options have diminished w. age, but it is not too late.
        I can and will meet great people, if I choose to leave Elaine.  If I choose to
        have kids, that will happen too.

    (3) WHAT IS GONE IS TRULY GONE.  Not just intellectually but emotionally I must accept this.
        There are many reasons what what has happened has happened.  In some ways things
        needed to happen to grow myself.  But even if not, it matters not now, as it is as it 
        is.  And the way it is is really pretty good.  As good as it could have been, who can
        know, and it is damaging to even consider or care.  MOST IMPT:  Make *any* decision
        with even a little bit of remorse over the past is deadly.  Living now, focused on the
        is deadly.  Stop doing it.  Even in this moment, and every moment after.

    (4) NOT FOR HER.  I have hurt her, and others.  I should<<>>do<<>>must care for her, and care
        more than I do today.  Still caring cannot be the reason for staying.  It cannot
        play in the equation AT ALL.  Doing so, breaks with freedom, it will always be 
        remembered.  She (and I) deserve better.

    (5) MUST FOLLOW GUT.  Yes, it may me down a longer path.  But even then it will be better
        because once at the end, I will know I am at the end.  Trusting in #1 and #2 I will
        eventually come out of this where (a) I have followed my gut, and (b) I am in a good
        place.   (NOTE: it may be that I could have had all that years ago.  Not really, cause
        what I could not have had back then, is that I did it following my gut.

    (6) GOOD ENOUGH  is good enough.  The question is not how rare is this person, or
        could I do better.  The question is: is the person good enough?  
        Will marrying this person workout really well in life?

    Freed from all these issues.  Now freed to leave.  Do I *want* to stay?

    (7) IF NOT NOW THEN LEAVE.  If following my gut does not take me toward Elaine now 
        then break up.  Who knows where that will go.  Perhaps I will see the light a month 
        later, perhaps I will drift and end up with another little different than Elaine.
        But waiting with Elaine for my feelings to change, makes little sense.  Not being
        with Elaine will change them faster than being here anyway.

    (8) NO FEAR.  In any case, I must live life w<<>>o being driven by potential negatives.  
        Not because they are not real, nor because they will not happen, but because
        operating from them means not living the life I would freely choose.
        This does not mean I don't set&recheck my expectations.
        It does not mean I must always go for more.  Life ia a balance, more of one is always 
        less of another.  At each moment in life I must make the choice of what is important to
        me at that point--the thing that moves be forward--  ??consequences be damned??

    (9) BE ME.  Perhaps if I were less picky, less ambitious, less brain oriented, I could have
        an easier<<>>happier life.  But I am at this moment, I am what I am at this moment.
        So if I am not satisfied w something, then I am not.  perhaps I "should" be from some
        perspective.  Perhaps things would work out better if I were to make a selection that I
        am not satisfied with.  But it is a bad choice.  Not being excited<<>>satisifed with a choice
        is a disasterous starting point.



    GOOD ENOUGH
    * A partnership where both are very motivated to make it work
    * Love, and in love with each other
    * Stable Core:  Emotionally, Financially, Sexually, Comfortable to spend time together, etc.

    - Attractive
    - Sense of adventure, Energy, Outgoing, Social, 
    - Intellectual Interests

    ICING
    - Giving person.
    - Able to follow my job.  
    - Desire<<>>ability to raise kids.






    ===========================================
    2<<>>24<<>>2009

    - Elaine is not a great match for me.  Plausible that in 5 more years of dating I would find a match, plausible I would find more of the same.
    - Do like perspective of asking is Elaine "good enough"
    - Biggest anxiety is the notion of starting over, and loosing 4 years.

    - Cannot stay because of that anxiety, but can stay if she is good enough

    What I have in Elaine
    - A willing partner who wants to better herself, and better us
    - An optimist
    - Someone I am attracted to

    -   Introversion<<>>Caution   Sex<<>>Intimacy<<>>Compassion
    -   LESS CRITICAL:     IntellectualInterests     Geography




    ==============================
    2<<>>19<<>>2009


          GOOD ENOUGH:
    --->  TIME:  Massively stressed by idea of loosing time put in.  lateness of my life.
          ACCEPT:  no matter how this shakes out I must accept large loss.  bigger loss if I leave.
          GOOD<<>>BAD JUDGE: Quite rational+emotionally mature.  But not in this case:  really blowing it.
    --->  Can almost see E&D as team
    --->  Job of a life, but not spending hours as I might want
    --->  Very little time to decide--now at 39 y<<>>o
    --->  Live as I would want, see if things break
    --->  If I marry, need to see this as appropriate path

    --->  At root:  Elaine leans inward & I lean out.
          + Practical problems: geography, physical, kids

       ----
    --->  In life there are WAY WAY more things I want than years to have them:  thus little patients
    --->  Content to do other in Elaine's presence, but only have smaller need 
          for 1-on-1 that is not:  intellectual, intimate
    --->  Want my mate to bring diversity (friends, activities) 
          and to enjoy the diveristy I bring

    ---------------------------------------------
    REALLY, HOW DO I SEE MY LIFE?

    - A Perfected Life--personal energy balance across:  Spirit, Ideas, Spouse, Kids, Career, Social, 
    - TIME<<>>ENERGY:  Career, Home<<>>Kids, Spouse, Social, Ideas, 

    WANT HOURS OF LIFE  --  Many aimed at things I care about
    - JOB<<>>HOUSE<<>>SLEEP<<>>COMMUTE -- minimized
    - FAMILY -- 
    - IDEAS -- work, world, hacking
    - SOCIAL -- family<<>>friends<<>>

    ---------------------------------------------
    Elaine
    - Confidence, Social, Openess, Energy,    <-- wish she wanted these things
    - Sexuality:  Physical, Intimacy, 
    - Geography
    - Self:  Kids, Laundry, Gifts
    - Age

    Elaine-Plus
    - It is way past time to marry<<>>kids
    - See glimmers of D+E team
    - On the same mental wavelength


    ---------------------------------------------

    2<<>>11<<>>2009

    CONTEXT:  Ursula says:  "decide if Elaine is 'good enough'"

    Ok, so:

    (1) Elaine is not what I was looking for.  She misses on some key areas, and
        - Those areas are reasonable to find in others (but have not done so yet)
        - They are truly relevant and important areas (I am not making them up)

    (2) Not sure if I can find someone that is 'what I am looking for'
        but I do belive I can find someone that I am excited about.

    (3) This is what it comes down to:
        I need to ensure that several questionable pragmatic issues are 'good enough'
        (a) Children, Her job, Where we live
        (b) Intimacy
        (c) Activities
        And I need to be excited about being with Elaine.

    If I cannot be excited, genuinely, significantly excited about being with her, 
    I should move on.
    - Note: this is not a comparative stmt, and it is not asking if she matches my vision
    - The key:  Am I, or can I be really excited to be with her?  (and she with me?)


    Well I am not excited right now.  but sometimes I do see glimmers that I could be
    - When I go visit, they may be high, and sometimes reality together brings them down
      Reality ==    we dont meet in intimacy  <<>>  I am not engagued by our common activities








    FIX suspend script
    - Write a paper every half year.


    ---------------------------------

    1<<>>28<<>>2009

    - Lots to cover, do it fast cause cannot affort many of these:  $$
    - Lots of reasons here for our issues, still I belive these are not THE key to those issues.
    - Some things we talk about are sensitive:  dont want her to pretend, but not really change.


    - HOMEWORK:  be married.  disappointed w. my performance.  
      (little dissapointed about my effort, but mostly it about my results, mind balking, or apathetic about it.)

    - FEEL ABOUT US
      - At times I feel I could be with someone that better matches me: confidence, energy, social, interests.  not my soul mate.
        - Not produtive thought, don't trust myown thinking here.  Not convinced I am focused on most impt things
      - When apart, sometimes will discount dissapointments<<>>issues and feel positive
      - When leaving, feel more negative.  (things really will be this way...)
      - Am compatible with her (also with many others too)
      - Trust her & respect her  (do not respect her lack of confidence)

    - ABOUT ME
      - Time: central focus.  

      - In my 30s, I have had 3 long relationships where I stayed in in part from momentum
        (in last 2 I had strong feeling that I was too old, to start over, too old to find 
         one that would really match me.)

      - At same time I worry that my analytical thinking partially blocking falling in love, given a fair shake.
        - am compatible w. so many, they all see the same
        - most impt decision, want "good deal for me"   
        - Feel like I could have become smitten w. confident person such that I felt like it was a good deal

      - Many very close friends (many women), feel less dependancy on mate.

      - Want to need her, but do not.

      - Attracted to asians


    HOW I FEEL ABOUT ELAINE
      - When you asked:  "what I liked, immediate reaction:  oh shit, what am I gonna say?"
      - Clearly attracted:  asian & petite
      - World view on a same wavelength, understand her, both were outsiders a bit
      - Trust her, no big issues, compatible, etc.
      - Can hold conversation on phone 

      - But less Common interests
      - Energy <<>> Confidence mismatch.  if not confidence at least affinity group
      - Social mismatch.
      - Not clearly in love.  

    ABOUT HER
      - Very reluctant to depend on others.  Self worth is bound up in her indepedence.
      - I am close as she has ever been, still she has trouble with love too.



    SUMMING IT UP
      - DECISION MAKING:   I feel my primary issue is way of making decisions.  (some lack of courage or confidence too, but not clear)
                           Prior relationship, never allowed progress, decided to jump in w. elaine, job of my life, never re-evaluted "jump in"
      - 3DATES->MARRIAGE:  Generally compatible, put energy in/a fixer, no screw ups.  HOW TO CHOOSE.
      - DONE BETTER:       I feel that if things had gone another way I could be w. someone that match me in:  
                           Energy/Social/Confidence/Adventure.  w. some common interests  w. attraction&compatibility
      - TOO LATE:          Not sure starting over now, I could.  Also do not want to start over.  also getting too old to have family
      - STILL CAN WORK:    I get glimpses of another thought:  while above may be true, & another would fit better.
                           Perhaps all of that is not so impt, and Elaine & I can be made to work, and that is what matters.


    SUMMING US UP
      - TWO BODY:          Real problem, that only recently understood.  Still somehow seems solvable (but I don't know how)
      - INTIMACY:          Not just reflection of my ambivelance, her issue prob can be relaxed, but will always remain.
      - ADV/ENE/SOCIAL:    Fundamental difference.  Can I live w. it?
      - LOVE:              Not clear or strong for either of us   (but could be blocked in both of us.)

      - TRUST:             Greater than average
      - COMPATIBLE:        While I might be with many, still I *am* with elaine too.

      - 



    -----------------------------
    12/2/2008
      My Issues:
      - Saving face
      - Passage of Time
      - Optimization (not having recognizable, avoidable loss)
      - Self doubt
      - Feeling under appreciated, feeling my circumstance is below my level
        feeling my behavior *was* lower, but is not higher or could be higer 

    Let me write the things I believe:

    * Important to see the most impt

    * SELF-DOUBT.  I dont trust my own assessments/convictions, and thus do not act.

    * I can only marry that which I believe in.  expediency/practicality here will be deadly.

    * "ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL" REASONING. Some of my worries are theoretical.  I have these 
      notions that all things being equal, I would prefer X over Y.
      But things are never equal, and this kind of reasoning can elevate the X vs Y issue.
      The greater the clarity, the more that issue carries weight relative to other issues
      potentially much greater in merit.

    * 


    * I am choosy, but not too choosy.  I do focus on too many X vs Y details.

    * Life is short.  Need to focus on the biggest most impt things





    -------------
    11/22/2008  

    * Difficulty living in the same city
    * Sexual Difficulties
    * 





    -------------
    Thinking by myself 7/28/2007 (elaine will force choice soon?)

    I AM IRRATIONAL ON THIS
    - I know I am not making progress.  I know that I dont have a plan for progress, really.
    - I know it is better to not stay in this place, any I also know that doing what I am now
      I will stay in this place.
    - Optomist:  There is an optomist in there that just say.  "ok, just give me a minute, and I will just decide"


    AT THE CORE -- I feel I could have had better than elaine, but fear that now this may be it

    WRONG THINKING
    - I am not too old, and there are many out there.
    - But this is a sad waste of life energy.




    <<>>
    Spoke with Rafah 4/22/2007

    Scared of
    (1) Being too old and too late.  and picking are slimmer
    (2) That I am broken in some way, and will never be satisfied.
    (3) That I might make a wrong decision
    (4) I feel that I have alot to offer, and want that symetrically


    #1,#2, Stresses me out, so I dont think about issue
    #1 & #2 keep me from leaving
    #3 keeps me from marrying
    <<>>
    #1 When I think about #1, its not true, but I have changed the 
       shape of my life, and the space of people I can date has changed.
    #2 Is also probably not true, but I am probabaly pretty picky, though you cannot tell
       from my dating.  


    I do think I end of dating with a block in place, a predisposition that this person is not
    the person for me, yet because of #1 I worry about leaving

    <<>>
    Conclusions:

    I should live my life open not closed.  
    Enthused not resigned.  Forward, not looking back.

    If I cannot do that with Elaine, then I should move on.  Period.

    But I should consider:  Would I move on Enthused, Forward, and Open?
    <<>>

    Few show stoppers with Elaine

    * Can have the social life I want
      * Should have party at my place
    * Physical troubles

    * Is she happy?  Confident?  
    * Will bring vibrancy into our lives?

    --------- 12/16/2006 
    Spoke with doug.

    DOUG SAID:
    - Seriously twisted inside
    - Deep issues with my mother causing very low ablitly to achieve intimacy....
      no instead it is causes failure to commit
    - going on retreat to avoid  going to a therapist
    - going on retreat to balance against non acceptance of DARPA
    - hurting myself physically because of darpa
    - dating women who want to marry me in order to hurt them.
    - completely detached from all of my own feelings.  (not just relationship, but about every emotional feeling)
    - attracted to asians specifically so that I limit my chances of finding a real match.
    -----------




    What I realize
    - I do long for elaine, or for something.  
    - I just wanted to come home and be with her.


    - Attracted 
      - I am really physically attracted to her
      - I feel drawn to her

    - Contented (happy&restless) to be with her
      - Happy. contented. bored...

    - Get me 
    - Elaine and I can talk on the phone for more time than I have been ablt to do with others.
      - Still I am not drawn to do it.
      - For me the world is a place to ponder.  It is for her as well.  (e.g. dont watch TV, read spiritual materials, tai-chi & meditation)

    - Energy/Texture

    - Elaine is quite limited in the amount of physical warmth she can give.
      - I Feel this loss accutely sometimes.  But I wonder if that can change.
      - Connected to this, making love with Elaine requires alot of the intensity 
        to come from me.  Sometimes it feel like she it just going thru the motions,
        (and sometime she is in to it, but generally this is with intensity from me first)
      - she only climaxes, and sometimes/often only gets really aroused with it, not me alone.
      - talking right after sex
      - not kissing 
      - babies are alien



    --------------------------------------
      - weak emotion; over think


    WAFFLE    - dont want to burn bridges;  I see lots of pros and cons on all sides of any choice;  this makes it tought to make decisions so
      - I will bulk at the decision to break up, and 
      - I will bulk at the decision to marry.         this leaves me in limbo
      - Staying in limbo, thinking about the negatives and wondering if I can live with them anyway may actually cause me to 
        forget the positive things about the person, and have an artifically negative view of them.  (Not sure hom much this is true)

    AMBITION
    - If something is too easily attained, then I have trouble valuing it.  There are people that I cannot get to date me, but once someone
      does date me for a few months, it is generally the case that it will move along to the point where I could marry them.
      I think this is a combination of my ability to be sensitive to the other person and their needs (And a reflex to fill them), and a strong
      ability to sense and fix problems that break many realtionships, and also becasue I am not dating very in popular people in the first place.
      (But most of my friends will push back saying how great and quite a catch my girlfriends are, if I say something negative.  I dont think the people I date are 
       undesirable or desperate)  Still part of me feels maybe this is a sign that they are "not in my league?" 
      Want relationship where I feel specifically lucky to be with them, yet the reasoning above makes that unlikely if they grow attached to me (as is natural) 

    AN UNROMANTIC WORLD PERSPECTIVE
    - I question how much people in general are truely matched, verses have simply become matched over time (but it could have been anyone)
      There are some people that I see, that do feel specifically matched.  It is very rare (almost never) that I have found someone that gave me the 
      impression that they would be specifically matched.

    SELF SUFFICIENT
    * ANOTHER BIG ONE:  I am relatively self sufficient, so there is little pain associated with not being married.
      The large pain is the feeling that life is short, and that I am not using it wisely.  In the past this has often left me with the 
      feeling that I should just go ahead and accept the person i am with.  

    INSECURITY
    - I think there is some kind of insecurity that pushes me into relationshops   (this is a somewhat mild effect, as I will go for a year+  by choice without dating)

    ------------------------------------------








    ---------------- 9/9  (2006?)

    Issues:
    - Physical
    - I am outward facing; she is a loner
    - Is she really into it?  children?  moving?  me?
    - dont feel 'wow'

    - Can talk w. her!

    --------- 8/3/2006

    *  IDEAL IN HEAD  
       - I have an ideal in my head about who I will be with, and Elaine does not fit this ideal.
       - I don't know if I will ever find that ideal.
       - I don't know if that ideal is even focusing on the right things.

    *  THE IDEAL
       - Attractive:  Asian, Younger, Petite
       - Common interests: Intellectual, diversity, not sports bar
       - Confident: Competient, Energetic, Outgoing, Self assured

    * Don't seem to *need* anything from a mate, that I don't get from others 

    * I feel like I felt when I had to go to OSU.  like I could do better given my talents



    --------- 8/1/2006

    ++  She is a good friend.  but no better than elaina.
    ++  Common: self betterment, philosophic outlook
    -   Lovemaking is too physical, not as affectionate
    -   Energy/Confidence

    -   Slow to accomodate, 
    -   Geography issue








    ----------  11/28/2005
    Saturday, Nov 6th 2004.  Date of our first hike

    Well it is not so early on, lets get serious!
    I should not have let this rest for so long!


    +  Attracted to her
    +  We talk well on phone.
    +  She is contemplative 
    +  She is positive and appreciative of me/life
    -- Hard org (lots of work)
    -  Never a person in the center of things, not so much dating
    -  Introverted
    -  Nervous like her mother around others
    -  Not an effusive person

    -  She does not like to do physically for me.  lazy?  in general?
    -  She hates the 'clean/classic' look.  I love it.
