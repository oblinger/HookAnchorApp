    TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF

    Things that matter to me are:
    - intellectual pursuits.   (If I go to a movie, or read a book, I want to talk about what it meant.)
    - social activity.  I love meeting friends, dinner parties, occasional dancing.  when I work I often drag my laptop to a coffee shop.  
      And easily make friends w. most any nearby person.
    - spiritual base.   My faith is not specific to any particular religion, but it is there, and it is relevant to my life.  (I am also catholic)
    - diversity.  in many things work, fun, friends, food.  there are many things to see, and I have the energy and drive to see them.
    I hope to have a partner that values the same.
