# Life.05-04-24 What Drives Me --



    FUN
    My life 'fun' experiences should be diverse sporadic yet constant part of my life
    I never want to wake up feeling that I have been a cog in some machine, and denied
    myself such interesting experiences.  

    That said, once we take finding a mate out of the equation of many of these activities,
    they fall flat as a structure for my life.  They are a great diversion, but they must
    be a diversion from something, which itself is not a diversion.



    CHASING
    I must be chasing something.  I will not have fun in a life that is about having fun.
    In chasing I must be careful.  Chasing something that is found to have no meaning will
    be a frustration and cause regret for efforts and time lost.  Pushing any one thing
    too hard in providing meaning to my life invites this disaster.  Rather I should identify
    several passions and weave them into my lifes tapestry.



    WORK
    I am a person who is inherently about ideas.  Big ideas, though I am happy to make a 
    small but solid contribution to those ideas.

    I want to make a good living from my efforts, though I now make sufficient money, that
    further pushing in this direction is not productive.  At IBM I am in danger of climbing
    the corporate ladder to nowhere.  Today I am falling asleep at IBM.  
    The real ladder there is a corporate one that leads nowhere.  There are opportunities 
    to push other agendas, but I am not yet following them, and it is not clear, how much 
    one can really do that anyway.  The work at IBM can be fulfilling, but the climbing
    objectives themselves ultimately will not be.


    That said, one important structural plank of my life is thinking and acting on ideas.
    Work is a natural place to do that.  Perhaps one day it will also be a strong way to 
    give back to this world.

    My life's work is the place for me to exercise those parts of me that I am most proud of, 
    those parts of me that define me as distinct person.  This is a place for me to extract
    intrinsic meaning in life, to feel a substance to my days, a place to go.  (I think)


    STATUS
    - Status as a researcher, status within IBM, status to friends and family are all relevant to me, but 
      they should not be my drivers.  I don't really care enough about researcher and IBM status, and 
      status among friends is best served by being true to other goals, rather than seeking that status directly.
      Get that status as an accident of other things you are doing.



    WIFE
    My wife is the first building block of structure, comfort, and security in my life.


    CHILDREN
    I want to have children.  Spending my life having "fun" will be too shallow for me.
    It will depress me with its inherent meaninglessness.  My life's work is a place for me
    to exercise those parts of me I find most unique, but pushing that to be the only 
    source of meaning for my life is not healthy.  It is too cerebral.  It can collapse
    to dust around me with the uttering of "so what?" at any time.

    Family is a viceral "life's work" structure around me, it provides feedback that
    utterly destroys the "so what?" retort.  That said, it cannot *be* my life's work.
    It does not touch parts of me that I find the most unique about me, and does not 
    exercise the 'ideas' and "action" parts of me.

    Family works well in conjunction with life's work.  Yes both will make some
    sacrifice in the combination, but both will benefit too, and what is more,
    I can do both well at the same time.  Fun will be radically changed, and 
    freedom in that direction will be severely limited.  But that was not where I
    recieve my happiness in life anyway.  Further it is not clear perhaps the new
    fun will outstrip the fun lost.

    What is most clear is that those who forgo a family in a bid to reap more meaning 
    elsewhere often find themselves struggling hard and only with partial success
    to fill the meaning void left by lack of a family.




    SPIRITUALITY
    This is a huge source of meaning for my life.  But I have treated it as an enemy that 
    might compel me to do make choices that I don't want to make because they are the
    right thing to do.  The truth is, I do want to do the things that are the right 
    thing to do.  I don't want to benefit from things that are wrong, but feel right 
    at the moment.  At the same time, I don't want to
