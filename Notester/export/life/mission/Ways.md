# life.Mission.Ways --

    The "ways" listed below cut across all of the aspects of my life, they capture the way all aspects are approached.
     
    CORE
    - At the root of my behavior is a continually-refined sense of correct principles and purpose.
    - I feel relaxed, confident, and happy about my actions because they stem from this purpose.

    EXPERIENCE
    - Perceive and *enjoy* all experineces in life with a youthful exuberance.
    - I go out of my way to have a life of rich and varied experience.

    ACHIEVEMENT
    - Strive be and do better.
    - My efforts have impact in my life, in others, and in the world.

    GIVING    
    - In my activities, consider what am I giving as well as receiving.

    ACCEPTANCE
    - Accept the state of my life as a combination of external circumstance, and personal behaviour both appropriate and inappropriate.
    - Measure my success by what I am doing *now* as much as what I have accomplished to date, and instead of what has come before.

    BALANCE   
    - Energy and attention are placed on the many dimensions of life in a balanced way so none receive efforts to the exclusion of others.
