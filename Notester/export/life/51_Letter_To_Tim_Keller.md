    Starting from an assumption
    taht the bible is 
    non-contradictoray word of god
    fine, but don't use conclusions to support that assumption

    Tim,

    I have been attending Redeemer Presbeterian Church for almost a year now, and it has been
    a revolutionizing experience.  (I also take advantange of your sermon subscription 
    service... thank you.)  I want to thank God for the message I have received.

    In the course of this year I have found myself questioning some key points, and decided
    to write a letter to you regarding them.  I don't belive these questions are easily 
    addressed and I will truly understand if your schedule does not permit a direct reply.
    That said, if you do have concrete responses and the time to respond, I would be very
    grateful.  In any case, only respond written or verbal in the form most efficient for you.

    I am a Catholic (by birth) and a Scientist (by trade).  The latter affords me a perspective
    that often feels at odds with core religious beliefs.

    I have arranged a set of five levels of belief and my thinking about each below.
    What concerns me most is level four.  It feels arbitrary and not well supported, 
    yet I am repeately told that it holds the key to my salvation.  This is an 
    uncomfortable position to say the least.  Any thoughts or pointers you have, 
    particularly on levels three and four would be greatly appreciated.



    LEVEL 1 -- Religious teaching (and yours in particular) provide many deep and relevant
    insights into the human condition.

       I belive this is true.  The way you tie your understanding of the human mind, both to
       concrete examples, and to a wide range of religious and secular thought leaders leaves
       little doubt in my mind regarding the wisdom contained in many of your messages.

    LEVEL 2 -- Structured religious experience (going to church, etc.) is a positive worth while activity.

       I believe this is true.  If you are serious about loosing weight, dont just make idle commitments to oneself,
       go to weight watchers.  The shared goals, wisdom, and energy will boost your chances of success.  
       The same applies to church.


    LEVEL 3 -- Existance of a "real" spiritual world

       Here is where I start running into trouble.  

       reductionist.  Artificial Intelligence researcher


    LEVEL 4 -- Personal salvation is achieved through faith in Jesus and his reserection

       I have never worried much about the role of Jesus before.  The question of the existence
       of God seemed so much more relevant to how I should live my life.  The Jesus question seemed
       mostly academic.

    LEVEL 5 -- Beliefs that differentiate one particular sect of Christianity from another, or from other religions.

       I continue to believe that this is not a significant issue for my consideration, other than when it impinges
       on how I might lead my life, choices I will make etc.  Even in these circumstances, I don't feel that we
       humans have insights to definitively select among these alteranitive (or else we would have).
       Thus when it ever becomes relevant in a practical day-to-day setting, I resort to my own hear, and wisdom regarding 
       the alternatives.
