# Life.Brin Letter -- Letter to david brin

    Let us assume that the world of "gnat" cameras will be the reality in 
    the nearish future as both of us believe.  Then I believe that the 
    matrix below expresses what is possible and inevitable in that world. 
    The left column represents how the various groups operate on the day-to-day. 
    And the right hand column represents how they behave when greatly  
    motivated (essentially this represents what is technically possible). 
     
     
                 | Standard practice | With infinite determination 
                 +<<>> 
    Government   | Dictated by law   | Spying is effective 
                 |                   | 
    Corporations | Dictated by law   | Spying is effective 
                 |                   | 
    Citizens     | Influenced by law | Spying effective for some (many?) 
     
     
    Notice that the right hand column is not greatly affected by social  
    order (laws).  When push comes to shove the powerful and wealthy 
    will be able to spy and get away with it; sometimes.  And when they  
    are sufficiently motivated they they will do it even when the possibility of 
    getting caught exists, and the consequence (by law) are dire. 
    So lets forget about this category.   
     
    We can really only affect what these groups do as a matter of course. 
    But, I will argue that it is the left column that most affect our 
    lives, so it is the most important area to control anyway.  For 
    example, a mega-corp insurance company that really wants to know if I 
    have AIDS could find out, in a thousand ways.  No law will change that. 
    But a law prohibiting seeking or utilizing that knowledge would have 
    a dramatic effect on the day-to-day behaviour of that mega-corporation. 
     
    I argue that in a world of gnat cameras restricting what various groups  
    can know will be much less effective than restricting what they are legally 
    allowed to know and act upon.  So that is what I want to focus on, how 
    the legal system can be arranged to maximize the positive effects of 
    transparency, while minimized its negative effects. 
     
     
     
     
    The degree to which standard practice is "dictated/influenced by law" 
    will be greatly affected by the legality of spying on the spy. 
    Note: it is quite possible to make on legal and the other illegal 
     
     
     
    Encouragement of flexible control of information flow and usage.
