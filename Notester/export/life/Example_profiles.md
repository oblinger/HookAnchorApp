    For those who take the time to read this I say thank you. I am an old fashioned guy who would like to meet a wonderful woman he can spend his life with. I believe that this world was created for two...Everything you do for enjoyment means that much more when you share it with the one you care about. I'm a family man who cherishes his time with those who matter. My friends would say I'm the nicest guy you will ever meet and the most dependable person they know. All I want to be remembered for is being the best man i could be. A good son, brother,father, husband and friend. On the lighter side you will find an athletic body which deceives most when they know my true age. I'd like to think I'm a funny guy who can keep conversation with anyone on any topic and never feel left out. Are you interested yet? I hope so.

    I have a hard time explaining what kind of women I like but here goes. Slim or athletic, intelligent, a sense of humour and a strong sense of family. You are driven but not obsessed with work, and you leave the pressures of the job behind when you come home. You like affection, old fashioned romance, and a man who isn't afraid to hold hands in public or kiss you on the subway. If this describes who you are and you think we might have something in common, drop me a note and we'll go from there. Don't be shy...
