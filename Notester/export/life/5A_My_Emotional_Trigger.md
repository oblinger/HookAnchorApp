    Here is the scenario:

    (1)  Dan expresses some Dan-reasoning.

    (2)  Some other challenges this Dan-reasoning, with an 
         "i-am-more-mature-or-i-know-better-than-you" tone (at least this is how Dan perceives it.)

    (3)  Dan is mildly annoyed, and motivated to resolve this conflict.
         Dan wants to find defense of his original reasoning (he is biased), 
         at the same time one of Dan's core beliefs about himself is that is his relatively
         smart and relatively unbiased, thus he wants reason thru this in an unbiased (logical) way. 
         He becomes much more careful about the assumptions and reasoning made by both sides.

    (4)  If Dan finds logic in the challenge and/or failed reasoning/assumptions in his 
         original reasoning, then Dan makes an immediate and explicit retraction.
         (Dan is motivated to find some part of his original reasoning that
          is still intact, and will proceed to the next step with that 
          sub-part of his original position, after he has made retractions of the other parts.)

    ** But only parts of the reasoning for which he has an explicit reasoned defense are taken to the next step.

    (5)  Dan has a carefully reasoned defense of his original reasoning and/or an argument against the
         other persons challenge.  Dan now feels "right" and righteous.

    (6)  With some urgency, Dan articulates this reasoning.
         Dan expects the other to either counter parts of his reasoning or accept those parts.

         If they do that Dan will have a jolly time, giving and taking points as the ensuing argument
         dictates.  This will continue to the point of consensus, mutual confusion, or boredom.


    At this point if the other person refuses to back down on the original challenge, *and*
    refuses to engage Dan to produce either counter reasoning or acceptance his reasoning
    then DAN IS PISSED.

    He feels the other person is attacking his logic, but themselves are not being logical.  

    The illogic of the other makes Dan more certain of his correctness, 
    yet he feels POWERLESS.  Because the other refuses to play by the rules 
    of debate Dan cannot be vindicated.

    Further, Dan thinks the other is "cheating."  They sense weakness in their position, and 
    conveniently they refuse to continue the debate rather than have to accept defeat.  
    It is like the chess player who seeing an inevitable loss
    "accidentally" topples the playing board.

    It is cheating, and Dan is powerless to stop the cheat.  The other can claim they have not
    lost, by simply refusing to continue debate once they see confusion/weakness.

    Or possibly the other is being "stupid" but is too stupid to even know that they are being stupid,
    and since both sides are inherently equals in any debate, all that Dan can achieve is a 'tie' with this
    stupid person, even though Dan knows he is so right.   UGGGGH.

    EITHER WAY DAN IS VERY VERY PISSED.  



    This scenario above is a somewhat common one for Dan, whenever the other walks away from the
    reasoning table without admitting defeat.  Even if he is not emotionally attached to the original 
    Dan-reasoning he will be very emotionally affected by his perception of injustice in the situation.

    What does this tell us about Dan?


    some thoughts:
    *  Dan thinks he is more correct and more unbiased than other (in part because he will not
       walk away from the debate table w/o declaring defeat).

    *  Dan's ego rests in part on his belief about his better-than-average correctness and unbiasness.



    Perhaps Dan should just say,  "Honorable debate requires either a counter to an argument, or an
    admission that is cannot be countered.  I see you are not interested in honorable debate today..."

    Perhaps Dan's ego should not rest on his correctness/unbiaseness.
