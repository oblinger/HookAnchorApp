# life.76\_Big\_Thoughts --



    *  Largest mistake is to lament lost opportunity.
       Done from 27 to 42.  No more, accept what is.

    *  Today my 900-pound gorilla is to decide elaine.

    *  I need to travel to a state where I accept my current world,
       - I accept the choices available
       - I accept that I could be alone
       - I accept that I now should focus on my life not my job.

    *  A prime question:  At the end of each day, did you live it as you would like?  Answer:
       No.  I do not spend my free time as I would like.
       No.  I do not have a feeling of forward progress.
       No.  My energies are too work focused.
       No.  I do not have the personal connections I might hope for

    *  I systematically ignore important but momentous decisions by focusing on short term
       "important" activities.


    *  No matter what I do now it will all work out well, but I am hurting myself by staying here.
       (As usual)


    ------------- FEW DAYS LATER ------------

    * I need to care much less how I look to others.  (my extended family & friends.)
      -> I feel deeply bad about how my in ability to make a decision, to waste time looks
         to others.  Perhaps even more than I feel for the looses themselves.

    * Elaine does not match my vision of a mate.  Energy, ambition, outwardness/socialabilty

    * Elaine is pretty special in her handling of all of this (and her understanding of all
      of it)  Am I really paying attention to the right stuff?

      
      Choices should be made based on their importance for me.
