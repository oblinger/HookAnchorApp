    Ron, 

    I know you got the good news since I was sitting in Barbra's office
    when she sent you a note.  The meeting went swimmingly!  In my meeting
    with you both on the day before, I really felt that I did not
    support the goals of the pitch with many details regarding how
    one might take in attacking the bootstrapping problem.  I stayed
    up into the night working on examples from the building design and 
    bike design domains to support this.  Barbra saw some of this work 
    before the meeting with Tony.  Several times he pushed the conversation
    down to these concrete examples.  You could tell they left him with a 
    positive feeling each time.  Thanks much for that!

    (The additional detail I showed Barbra on our second meeting 
     give some indications about an architecture etc.  
     I hope to share with you in the near future.)

    On a personal level I felt very good about the whole interaction.
    It is clear that to win support from Dr. Tether, one must appeal
    at an intuitive level, but he really does have a sharp intuition
    for AI issues.  I can tell if you are on the wrong side
    of his intuition; well you are out of luck.  Still I can imagine 
    I might be reasonable at the task of going in there there and 
    arguing for programs and ideas.  Important to know.


    The bad news from my perspective is the absolute no-go on any 
    continuing relationship with IBM.  This is quite a bit worse
    than I was hoping for.  I understand it, but it doesn't make
    the pill any easier to swallow.  

    My basic problem is that from what little I know about the 
    jobs you showed me for that people had after DARPA, I would 
    rather have the one I have now.  Now that is not fair, since
    I really have not yet had a chance to understand what each
    of those on this list you provided me is really doing.  
    (I am going to investigate this ASAP!)  Clearly I will be 
    more marketable after 4 years a DARPA, but I have seen just 
    how random IBM hiring can be.  I watched a parade of very strong 
    ex-AT&Ters come and go without getting offers.  


    Still I feel I just have to find away around this issue.
    The devilish part of starting to develop a program before 
    going to DARPA is that I now can see in a very visceral way, just 
    how fundamental the work at DARPA would be.  These are ideas that have been
    rolling around in my head for 15 years.  They are just too big to 
    attack at IBM on my own, or with a small grant for a few years.
    DARPA is the only way.

    Thanks for all of your help!
    Talk soon,
