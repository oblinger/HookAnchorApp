    ABSTRACT:  We present an approach to learning procedural knowledge by 
    demonstration called similarity-based alignment and generalization.  Key to our 
    approach is the ability to induce complex procedure structure (loops and 
    conditional branches) by aligning multiple unannotated demonstrations of a 
    procedure.  We present an implemented instance of a similarity-based alignment 
    and generalization algorithm that relies on the known Input-Output Hidden 
    Markov Models, and describe an extension, the SimIOHMM, that significantly 
    improves the algorithm's performance.  We present an empirical evaluation that 
    demonstrates our system's scaling performance and quantifies the performance 
    increase obtained through the use of the SimIOHMM extension.
