# TL.Activity.KeyQuestions --


    TECHNICAL QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
    - Are the algorithms of the DARPA TL programs the most effective for addressing the
         Template filling problem?
    - Are the fruits on both sides of these two efforts worth the cost of building the bridge?
    - Does the template filling problem space provide enough diversity to test higher levels of transfer leraning?
    POLITICAL QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
    - Is this a burning need within DoD?
    - who would the customer be?  
    - how does this fit with other existing DARPA efforts?  
    - Is this where we want to hang our hat (in the TL program?)


    NEXT STEPS
    - Leslie&Tomas talk with Regina Barzilay (@ MIT) is there a connection to be made here?


    TYPES OF COLLABORATIONS
    - Apply TL algorithms to Data being used by Singapore
      (If it is a good demo & not too hard, we should do it)
    - Apply TL algorithms to the framework being developed
      (If TL algs really are likely to be best of breed, then yes, else no)
