    <<>>
    TODOs
    - RMS Error threshold; Regret threshold

    - Timeline for Y2 activities
    - answer metrics questions
    - get toolkit deliverables 
    - get ISLE deliverables desc.
    - fill in all other  parts of briefing
    - write up Y2 plan (with dates) for NRL deliverables & ISLE responses & NRL evals from the teams
    - get buy in on Y2 plan
    - get buy in for the parallel development plan for GPL+
    =======================================================

      === AGENDA ===

    - Status of funding
    - Travel rules
    - Year two kickoff
      - Most of time for internal team planning.  2-3 days long.

      - Optional short talks 5-10 min on Year two plans by each team member.

    - Slides
      - Primary deliverable over next week is compelling vision of science & deliverables.

    - Question of Year two ISLE domains.
      - Average performance on problems generated by NRL.
        - Will conform to Genesetereth protocol if available
        - will be developed by NRL 

    - Planning   
      * Evolving Y2 Plan will be on wiki.  I encourage point-to-point discussions to resove optimal dates.

      * Staged deliverables schedule;  delivery of last provided scenerios last.

      * Four pronged attack

    ========================================================

    GO/NO-GO TESTS
    - Justify thresholds for Go/No-gos
    - Scaling procedures for regret
    - Slide on RMS thresholds
