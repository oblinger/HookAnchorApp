    Thanks for your interest Bootstrap Learning.  Unfortunately the initial solicitation for proposals is complete.  Even were the initial period open, individuals would typically need to team with others in order to produce a complete approach for Bootstrap Learning.  

    I do encourage you watch the list of open BAAs, and if you see an appropriate open BAA, to seek teaming opportunities as appropriate.

    Best of luck,
    Dan



    Once the decision to fund a particular thrust is made, an open call for proposals (a BAA) is published.
    Selected proposals typically represent DARPA's interest level in this particular thrust.  Once this process is complete
    there is typically no funds available for 

    The advantage to DARPA's bidding process is that all participants propose at the same time, ensuring that 
    each proposal has an equal opportunity for funding.  The disadvantage is that does not provide opportunities 
    for 


    Stuart, 

    I am sorry you are hitting a wall here.  And I want to spend a moment to explain why.

    DARPA focuses it resources intentionally at large problems where progress is impossible by other means.  It has done that in the case of TL, and solicited all in the US to participate.  That is really the appropriate place for you to compete against other technologies.

    DARPA has intentionally not given me funds to spend on good small efforts that will not lead to a new program.  Creating a new DARPA effort is an enormous undertaking, I would guess about 3-5 person years goes into the creation of a new program.  So many many good ideas never get their own program.


    ONE AVENUE LEFT
    I want the few programs that I will run here at DARPA to be the best possible programs, so I am open for researchers to present their idea for a revolution, a revolution whose ideal patron is DARPA.  You are welcome to send me two power point slides explaining the revolutionary idea, and why it will change the world.

    I will not do anything with it immediately.  But I will be creating a program or two more before I leave here (I hope.)  And I am always looking for the next revolution.  That said, I find it extremely unlikely that the next revolution will be TL, just done right.  Still I am happy to receive such a pair of slides.

    I should not invite you to do further work than that, since I would have not way to fund your current work.


    In the future, when you know you are send a note to a busy PI.  It is important that you make your case in the first 5 minutes.  These guys are just too busy to really dig in deep with each person that drops them a note.

    But the main challenge here, is that you are simply not joining the project through the bidding process.

    Regards,
    Dan
