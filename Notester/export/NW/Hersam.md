    Highest Relevance for IBM

    #1.  Band gap photobleaching in isolated single-walled carbon nanotubes
         - study light emission in nano-tubes
         - optical amplifier; optical properties
         (early work on seperation based on size and chirality using light)


    #2.  Room temperature Negative Differential Resistance through Individual Organic Molecules on Silicon Surfaces
     "Molecular Electronics  -- Single molecule current flow
       don't use gold (which is bad for fab lab)
     S' Nathan Guisinger   (2nd year)  very good experimentalist
     II' Cherie Kagan    Molecular electronics
     I' Chris Murray
