    met at ICML 2004
    seemed high energy, proactive, and sharp to me.

    Hi Dan,

    sorry I didn't get back to you earlier - thing get a bit crazy here sometimes :)  (I think I started 
    bragging about baby sleeping well a little bit too soon :(

    As to the student, his resume looks good - I would probably send it to Chid Apte's group; possibly
    to Sheng, but it's unlikely he will get interested since this is not a 'systems person'.

    "Hi Daniel,

    My apologies for not getting in touch with you sooner after our meeting at
    ICML. I wanted to make sure that I had followed your suggestion, and done
    some homework regarding the available positions at IBM Research before
    sending you my CV. Also, I wanted to thank you for our long conversation
    at the poster session. Your advice was very insightful.

    I've attached my current CV. After browsing through the IBM Research
    website, I've picked out a couple of research groups where my
    background and research experience might be a good fit.

    - IBM Research (T.J. Watson Center)
    - Mathematical Sciences Division
    - Statistics group
    - Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining group

    I've also found the following open positions which seem like they
    might be a good match:

    K057426 - Bioinformatics & Pattern Discovery Group
    GF2004 - Herman Goldstine Postdoctoral Fellowship (Mathematical
    Sciences Division)
    K089171 - Research Staff Member (Mathematical Sciences Division)
    K089173 - Research Staff Member (Mathematical Sciences Division)

    Thank you again for all your help and advice. Do let me know if there
    is anything else you require of me. I look forward to hearing from
    you.

    Sincerely,

    Aaron
