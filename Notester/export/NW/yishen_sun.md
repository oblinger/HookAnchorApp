    Abe:  Always at the top course wise.    Research was slowed down because of blending of ad hoc techniques.
          Best presentation in session.     In top 15% of those finishing last years (wish-washy)

    - Theoretical analysis; simulation analysis; and algorithm development for networking.

    - Algorithm in edge router to 
      - Traffic shaping and congestion control in access network
    - 802.16  fixed wireless networks access network
      - want to do conjestion

    Used opnet simulator: 
    - 


    analytical model of performance   (focus, not focus on programming)
    - later verified by simulation




    It was nice talking to you this afternoon.  As the follow-up of our
    conversation, attached is the electronic copy of my resume.  In addition,
    the introduction of the research projects at
    <<>> seems to be
    quite related to my current research focus.
