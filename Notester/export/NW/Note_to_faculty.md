# NW.Note\_to\_faculty --



    As many of you know I am a Researcher at the IBM Watson lab, 
    and I coordinate interactions with Northwestern University as well.
    I will be visiting NW next Wednesday and Thursday.

    Northwestern University is not as well known within the IBM labs,
    as I think it should be, and this means we are likely missing 
    connections useful to both NW and IBM.  In this next recruiting 
    season I hope to identify a few strong candidates from NW for 
    full-time or summer hire that serve to drive further interest 
    in NW programs.  Once identified, I will follow up with the students
    themselves, and then actively try to match them as approaprite
    within IBM reserach. 

    If are working with students that you think would serve well in 
    this role let me know!  I will be visiting with ECE on Wednesday
    and CS on Thursday, and would be grateful for your time in speaking
    about your students as appropriate.  Please contact:
      Greg Lehto in CS     or
      Nancy Singer in EE 

    Thanks,
    Dan Oblinger





    Hello all,

    As about half of you know I work at IBM's Watson Research lab. and I 
    coordinate interactions with Northwestern University as well.
    I will be visiting NW next Wednesday and Thursday.  As your schedule 
    permits, I would love to meet up for a few minutes, to see how
    your research and in some cases job search is progressing.

    Let me know if you have time, and if you do, you can send a note to
    either Gred in CS or Nancy in ECE to set up a time.  Hope things 
    are going well, and thanks much.

    Cheers,
    Dan
