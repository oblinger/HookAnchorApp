    Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today, and I appreciate your
    help in connecting me with Geoffrey Burr.  I'm interested in using the
    optical bench skills I've learned here at Northwestern in the fields of
    holographic storage and optical information processing.  I've attached
    my c.v., and thanks again.
