    "Hi, All

    FYI, the following announcement of our summer internship program was sent to 
    the chairs and faculty (over 600) on our CS/EE/Math mailing list.   A hardcopy 
    of the poster (attached as a PDF file) in the attached note will be sent this 
    week to 120 department chairs.
    cheers, arcadia

    IBM Research is pleased to announce the 2005 Summer Intern Program in Computer 
    Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematical Sciences at its United States 
    locations.  We are seeking highly motivated graduate and undergraduate students 
    who are interested in pursuing an exciting summer of research, prototyping, and 
    exploring new frontiers of these and related disciplines.  Students will have 
    the opportunity to work closely with an outstanding research team on 
    challenging problems that range from leading-edge theories to real-world 
    systems and applications.  With a summer internship, students can experience 
    the dynamic technical environment of the largest industrial research 
    organization in the world and network with other top students from many 
    different fields and universities.
