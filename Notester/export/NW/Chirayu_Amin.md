    I am Prof. Yehea Ismail's fourth year graduate student at Northwestern
    University. I will be graduating in June 2005 as we discussed today. I am 
    attaching a copy of my latest resume (in pdf and word formats) with this email.

    My research topics include VLSI CAD algorithms related to timing
    analysis. I have also worked on developing timing models for complex
    circuits (linear and nonlinear) and studying the effects of process
    variations on timing and power.
