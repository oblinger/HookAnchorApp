    "Dan, here is an Extreme Blue recruiting presentation our marketing person put 
    together.  I removed some pages to get it down in size (I actually don't use 
    any PowerPoint on campus).  This PPT should give you an idea of what the 
    program is.  It even has speaker notes:)

    Please let me know if there is any other information I can get for you, or if I 
    can answer any questions.

      Thanks,
      David

    David, 

    I would be happy to get information directly, but it may also make sense to 
    have this diseminated to all CRMs.
    Just a few slides, with pointers to where to send students could be added to 
    our next organization wide update.

    I would be happy to pass this information along, or get you in touch with the 
    right people.  Just let me know.

    David,

    Here are the two people I mentioned to you on the phone, Daniel and John.  They 
    are both IBM campus recruiting reps (not sure about the official title), Daniel 
    at Northwestern and John at Howard University.  I suggest you get in touch with 
    them and educate them about Extreme Blue so they can spread the word about it 
    in the campus when they visit  :)

    Daniel and John, you can get more info about EB at w3.ibm.com/extremeblue (this 
    is the internal site).  There is an external site, that David will tell you 
    about.

    Best regards to all of you,

    Maria

    Lilac, Maria and Matt, I really wanted to stay around longer this afternoon to 
    talk to you three, but things moved so quickly and the next thing I knew, I was 
    in a cab.

    I wanted to say thanks for all your help at Sloan.  What you three are doing is 
    above and beyond, and it makes a difference.

    Two favors to ask:
    Send me the names of any hot candidates you find.  Of course, as always, we are 
    looking for good strong diversity candidates.
    Please give me your feedback on my discussion with the students.  It's been a 
    long time since I've been in their shoes, and the last thing I want to do is 
    come across as arrogant, cocky, old IBM, etc.  As I get more and more years 
    with IBM I have a real fear of becoming "an old IBMer".  I would welcome your 
    criticisms with open arms.

    Thanks again.  You guys rock.

      David
