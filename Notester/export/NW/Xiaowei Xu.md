    Dear Brenda -

    I am writing to introduce to you an absolutely stellar PhD student (the 
    brightest I have seen in 20 years at Northwestern), who is looking for a 
    summer internship.  His name is Xiaowei Xu and his resume is attached.  As 
    you can see, has a MS in statistics and is in the third year of his PhD 
    studies in IE/MS.

    Xiaowei is a really incredible guy who learns new things faster than anyone 
    I have ever seen.  In addition to his deep understanding of theoretical and 
    applied statistics, he's very well-versed in supply chain modeling, he's 
    picked up excellent skills in marketing and economics, and he is very 
    gifted with optimization and numerical analysis.  As a result, he's able to 
    bring an impressive array of techniques to bear on practical problems.

    As an example, I'm attaching a paper he and I wrote.  The objective of this 
    paper was to examine the problem of how much variety to offer in a 
    differentiated product line from both an operations (cost) and marketing 
    (demand) perspective.  To analyze it, he learned a lot about logit models 
    of demand from the marketing literature and supermodularity theory on 
    lattices from the mathematical economics literature.  Using these, he was 
    able to get a number of very clean analytical results.  But, because he is 
    also extremely adept computationally, he also learned and implemented an 
    interval analysis method for global optimization, that enabled him to 
    generate insights into the extremely complex case of a multi-segment market.

    In his current work, Xiaowei has pressed well beyond the analysis of this 
    paper, using game theory to model competition and demand models that are 
    new to the operations literature.  Because of his stellar analytical 
    abilities, as well as his uncanny knack for seeing the gaps in the research 
    literature, I believe that Xiaowei is destined to produce some fundamental 
    breakthroughs.

    He is looking for an internship this summer because he would like his work 
    to reflect and impact actual practice.  I have no doubt that he is capable 
    of making great contributions to an applied research project.  So, I 
    recommend him to you without reservation.  In addition to doing you proud 
    on any project you throw at him, I would expect his industry experience to 
    strongly influence his long-term career.  It would be good for all of us if 
    a mind like Xiaowei's can be focused on the problems that matter most to 
    industry.

    If anyone at IBM might have a summer position for a brilliant PhD student, 
    they can reach Xiaowei at xuxiaowe@northwestern.edu.  Of course, I would be 
    most happy to provide any additional information as well.

    Thanks and best wishes!

    Wally "
