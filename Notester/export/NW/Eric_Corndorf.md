    Quantum crypto experiments & theory

    Experiments:
      Using quantum properties of optical channel (laser light)
    Theory:  (not his strongest side)
      Key distribution:  do this without single photons


    @x wants to be buisness analyst too
    Thanks, Dan.  As I was alluding to during our meeting, I'm really not 
    committed to continuing what I've done thus far -- for that matter I'm 
    not committed to staying "in the lab."  I realize that your job is to 
    match students with IBM research groups but I was wondering if you also 
    had any connections into other IBM departments.  I can only guess that a 
    hard-science Ph.D. is attractive as an analyst or in business strategy. 
      Thanks for any info, Dan.


    I like to make this work.



    BLURB:
    My training is in quantum optics, quantum measurement and detection 
    theory, fiber-optic communications, cryptography, and quantum 
    cryptography.  My research has focused on novel approaches to achieving 
    specific cryptographic objectives using the inherent quantum noise of 
    coherent-states of light.  While I feel comfortable working within my 
    specialty, I have no reservations branching out into new and different 
    fields of research.

    please let me know if I can provide you with any more informarion.

    P.S. I hope you enjoyed your Yankees win last night because the Twins
    will sweep in Minnesota (which is, of course, where I'm from).
