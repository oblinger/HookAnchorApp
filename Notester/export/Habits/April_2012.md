    FULL LIFE







    === 

    Life is finite.  There is life left, but more is behind than in front.
    Unbounded dreaming is over.  Now is time for focus on what is important,
    for resolving open needs, for pinning things down.
    In the short term I need to get my footing back, I am tripping
    forward into each week right now.  I need to stop this.

    My focus needs to be on attainable goals, on execution, on health,
    on social, on a mate.
