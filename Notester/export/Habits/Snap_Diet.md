    === RULES ===

    - HANDLING EXCEPTIONS --
      ????

    - RULE CHANGES ONLY APPLY TO SUBSEQUENT DAYS
      - eh?  too harsh for now?
      - Any direct violation requries sacrifice of $20 that prepped for that sacrifice








    === REASONING ===

    - Loosing any amount of weight per week is HARD, and backsliding small gains generally happens.
    - IDEA:  Use short focused bursts to loose slightly larger amounts of weight for 
      very time limited periods of time.
    - TARGET:  1-2 lbs per week after a 2-3 lbs first week.


    - STRONG RESTRICTIONS: since this is a time-limited regime it makes sense to greatly 
      restrict the variety of foods to those that maximize weight loss while minimizing hunger.
      The dramatic restriction in variety can help to increase will power since food choices
      are limited those those that are not overly appetising.

    - CATESTROPHIC RELAPSE is possible, even likely.  Thus:
      - LIMITING TIMEFRAME to an explicit and short period is important
      - EXIT PLAN.  Explicit planning to avoid rebound is critical, so exit plan must be in place
      - EXCEPTIONS PLAN
