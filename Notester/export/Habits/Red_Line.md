    MINIMAL PROCESS
    - 

    IDEAL PROCESS
    - Breakfast is minimal and protein focused
    - Lunch is larger and later
    - Snack is delayed and protein only
    - Dinner is smaller and later
    - Evening snacks are avoided, only boring filling stuff




    PROCESS
    - Pick a REDLINE weight.  (right now it is 195)
    - *ANY* first-in-the-morning weighing at or above this triggers REDLINE
    - Once in redline, *ALL* sweets are removed, aim to be hungry most nites,
      Aim to eat minimal meals, *only* when hungry, eat only most fill foods.
    - REDLINE continues until the STAND DOWN weight is reached.
      (Usually this is 2-3 pounds below the REDLINE weight.)


    === TRIGGERED RESPONSE ===
    Once redline is triggered.  The follow are triggered in a soft way,
    e.g. can decide to simply ignore these general rules as is convenient.

    - No Sweets
    - Go To Bed Hungry & Track eating and reduce meals after larger ones
    - Exercise 4 mornings per week.  Ride bike as much as possible.
    - Salads for lunch & Generally swap over to lower cal foods as much as possible


    === SECOND LEVEL RESPONSE ===
    Triggers after 10 days above trigger, or 3 weeks without standing down.

    Need to make this up when it happens....




    ===  MOTIVATION <<>> BACKGROUND  ===

    - When focused elsewhere, or when I dont have a clear dieting plan
      my weight can slip upward.  
    - This factor, more than any weight loss success has cause much damage.
    - The goal is a simple self-working procedure that avoids this.
    - Want to have a very attainable short term goal to boost confidence,
      and get self back on track.
