    DETAILS
    * BEFORE LAST SLEEP:    Set wake up time appropriately, then stick to it!
    * BEFORE ALARM SNOOZE:  Activate grenade.  (No longer used)
    * BATHROOM ALARM:       Set 15 min later.  Once in bathroom get ready.
    * BEFORE ALARM OFF:     Once holding grenade, no more snoozes, Then before turning off alarm, get out of bed.
    * BEFORE BATHROOM:      Pull up covers
      - If double sling, bring clothes to restroom, or computer on bed
      - Otherwise don't leave restroom till done w. shave&shower
    * GOAL = 30 BY DOOR.  Goal is dressed and stuff by door by :30 if you want to stretch out eating and cleaning that is after

    CONTINGENCIES
    * If I need more sleep, then change alarm time the night before.
      My goal is 7 hours of sleep, and to wake the same time each day.
      So if not too harsh, keep the 6am wakeup.
    * If I wake in the night and screwup my sleep, then reset clock (in the night)
    * If I wake with thoughts that I want to follow, so that, but in the shower or on the roof.
    * Never?  Sleep past one snooze.
    * If I need to do 'extra' stuff in the morning, then that should happen *after* my bag is 
      by the door.


    REASONING
    Getting off to a good start in the morning can really make a big difference in my day.
    I want to adopt habits that cause this to happen automatically.
