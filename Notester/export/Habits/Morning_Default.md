    MY MORNING DEFAULT -- When not immediately going to work, or appt then

    === WAKE ===  
    * Wake after one snooze --> SitUp under covers, start light meditation.
      - No play; If sleepy, then shower
    * Meditate/Pray
    * Shower/Dress

    === MAX FOCUS TIME === 
    * Select (earliest/latest) ending time for this activity.
    * Lower expectations for this time, but don't dilute with lesser tasks
      (Must try to make this a sought after time; you *want* to have it)
    * Try to be alone with laptop.
    * Put off all small things:  add them to todo list, don't look at email, don't eat.
    * Do organize& *plan* for lesser tasks.  Do execute on hard tasks.  Do contemplate.
    * Keep questioning if how to make it better
    * Get Laptop the night before;  Have blanket;  
    * OPT: Coffee ready.  
    * END W SOMETHING FUN

    BACKGROUND:
    So many small things derail my intentions to focus, and to accomplish.

    APPROACH:
    - Radically remove all activities at beginning of day prior to my focused session.
      (allowed one snooze, to mediatate, and to use restroom first)

    DETAILS:
    - Sit up in bed during waking up


    DERAILERS:
    * Expectation of failure  (nothing will come of the focused time)
    * Uncertainty of actions  (lack of clarity about what to do => put off | do easy thing)
    * The trivial             (need to accomplish the trivial, expends time/energy for the impt)
    * Novel Location          (minimize requirements that will fail in different locations
    * Hunger           

    * Planning day & starting with momenutum ==> better day.
