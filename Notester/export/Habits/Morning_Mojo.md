    (!) MOVING -- fast right as you wake
    (2) MISSION -- make your mission for the day (write it down)
    (3) MILESTONE -- measure accomplishments at SIX hour mileston after waking

    MISSION   --  Written spec for the MOJO portion of the day.  
                  Must have easily measured success criteria (time or task based)
    MILESTONE --  Goal is to achieve mission by milestone point.  allowed to work past milestone.
                  also allowed to reduce goals if (1) task was too hard, or (2) you blew it today.  
                  Just be explicit.



    === BACKGROUND ===
    - Emotions are all about momentum.  if you are getting stuff done you will feel good, thus do more.  Thus
      --> Structure Activity Early
    - Will not succeed in being productive all the time.  Trying will exhaust.  Thus:
      --> Have defined periods of work and non-work
    - Deadlines help.  They help conentrate time for a give amount of work; sharping focus.  Thus:
      --> End period of work with a deadline.
    - Shit happens.  When it does we want to push ourselves, BUT we do not want to end up always pushing. Thus:
      --> Have deadline, with *some* time after it.  
          This allows us to stay the 'deadline' mentality and also recover the 'success' feeling
          Also provides a post deadline wind-down period for lighter work as reward on days we make deadline.
    - Concrete plans facilitate quick action.  Thus:
      --> Plan specific actions each day.
