# Habits.Progress --






    [Background]
    - I make progress on little things, but never really attack the big ones... 
      in my personal life, and professional life, I outline, then backburner anything that gets big or important.

    - I can fritter most all of my hours away avoiding the center issue rather than attacking it.
      I often spend most of my time frittering
