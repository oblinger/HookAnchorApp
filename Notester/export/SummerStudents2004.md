    clara nyc:

    Clara,
    Your profile has a warm balanced feel.  I also think I fit many of
    your desired traits though declaring oneself to be decent, with
    a high IQ and EQ is a bit silly.  These are things one has to
    demonstrate.

    Have a look at my profile, and write me if you have the same 
    reaction I did.


    Very happy to have a chance to write,

    -dan
