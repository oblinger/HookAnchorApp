    RULES OF PLAUSIBLE OUTCOMES 
     
     
    99% META RULE 
      Human and organic processes are probabilistic in nature.  Even with 
      overwhelming support nothing is 100%.  This rule modulates most 
      of the other rules since they are based on human action. 
      This dosent really mean 99% it might be 90% or 99.999% but it 
      implies that there will be significant counter examples to the specified  
      trend. 
     
    =============== 
    HUMAN REASONING 
    =============== 
     
    HIERARCHY OF GOALS 
      Both peoples and societies have a hierarchy of goals. 
      And they dramatically focus on the toplevel goals, so that secondary 
      goals are largely ignored until more primary goals are satisfied. 
      THUS, Behavior will be swifty masked and unmasked change as goals change. 
     
    PULLING TOGETHER 
      99% of Humans will bridge great differences, and great difficulties  
      to address an even greater common threat. 
     
    BASICALLY GOOD 
      Humans want to do good. 
      Humans largely agree on what is good. 
     
    INESCAPABLE EFFECTS 
       Continue on path even when outcome is bad?? 
       (How does this relate to "Pulling Together") 
     
     
    ================= 
    TECHNOLOGY TRENDS 
    ================= 
     
    THOSE IN POWER ARE IN CONTROL 
      Even more with technology 
     
     
     
    POWER TREND 
      Total number of Joules of energy manipulated by humans is increasing 
     
    PROGRAMMABILITY TREND 
      Universal methods adopted becuase of their flexiblity. 
      - Mass production 
      - Mass personalization 
     
    DOMINANCE REPLICATED EFFECTS 
      Processes that are self replicating, dominate other effects within 
      their sphere of influence.
