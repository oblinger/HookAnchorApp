    INTUITIONS UNDERLYING PLAUSIBLE INFERENCE
    Properties of plausible knowledge
    GENERAL:  A Pl. stmt. is a generalization
        +  It describes a way in which a group of individuals are the "same"
        +  It seperates a subgroup of individuals from a larger group
    NON-EXCLUSIVE:  A Pl. stmt. is never exclusive.
        Even when a Pl. stmt. declare two individuals the "same" it does not
        preclude the possibility that they are different in some other way.
        Each Pl. stmt. is a factor among many which form a predictive model.
    COMBINABLE:  Ways Pl. stmts. combine must be specified.
        Individuals are potentially subject to a number of Pl. stmts.
        In such cases 
    SPLITABLE:  
        Allows expert to split knowledge into a relation they understand, 
        and a context they do not.
    FACTOR:  Pl. stmts. can be viewed as factors
    NARROW:  Reasoning/Action/Learning occur in very narrow context.
        In such context there will be simple relations that are valid.
        
    SMALL:  A Pl. stmt. describes a relation over a small num. of quantities
