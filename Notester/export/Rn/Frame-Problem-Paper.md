    FRAME-PROBLEM-PAPER: 
    The Frame Problem is the problem of [compactly] specifying the state of the
    world after performing some action.
    Many researcher's have tried various methods for use a closed world
    assumption for inferring the vast number of aspects about the world
    that remain ``the same'' after applying an operator.
    Two problems:
    -   ``The same'' is different for different predicates, impagine reading
        book in a tub filling with water.  Reading of a book does not affect
        the filling of the tub, non the less, the water level is not the same
        after reading the book.
    -   Many secondary effects accompany the primary effects of an operator.
        Going to the store in your car means that the things in your car
        also go to the store.
    We hypothesize that all the various effects of a set of operators can
    be compactly expressed as the result of some small set of independant
    effects that combine to produce the observed behavior.
    EG.  encode world as ``Stay the same'' type of effects and
         change the world  effects.  Blocks stay put; pushed blocks move.
    The representation is compact because the interaction between effects
    are not specified, they are generalized from observation.
