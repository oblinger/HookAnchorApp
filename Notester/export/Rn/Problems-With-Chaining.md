    Subject: Plausible inference
    Status: RO
    Here are some problematic inferences that arise from chaining 
    across plausible rules:  from Reiter's "on interacting defaults"
    "Typically" is not necessarily transitive
    University-student > adult
    adult > employed
    However, university-student > not-employed
    Interaction between "all" and "typically"
    21-year-old -> adult (axiom)
    adult > married
    However, 21-year-old > not-married
    Quebecois -> Canadian (axiom)
    Canadian > Speaks-english
    However, Quebecois > not-speaks-english
