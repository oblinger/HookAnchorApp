# AR.04\_10\_Meeting\_Response --


    I want to thank everyone for a very productive call on Monday.
    We identified several next steps, and I thought I would just
    summarize them here:

    (1) Bob will send us a link to the current beta of the Rational Functional
        Tester, and we will investigate the coverage of this tool on both the 
        eclipse and windows platform.
        The aim of this effort is to understand the issues in using the 
        instrumentation and execution support of that product to drive our 
        personal wizards system.

    (2) We will consider how our current technology can be used to support
        refactoring and/or parallel updating of many test scripts. 
        The aim of this effort is to support simultaneous updates to many test
        scripts when the underlying application is updated.

    (3) We will also look at the rational functional tester to see if our ability
        to record test script based on multiple demonstrations would add value 
        to the tool as it exists now.


    Thanks,
    Dan
