    Nice talking to you today and you did a fine job presenting personal wizards.  To reiterate my thoughts:

    1) Start with simple real world, valuable example (just one step beyond hello world) that you can demo quickly for potential deployment
    2) Consider including terms like continuous optimization since that is part your intent (in my mind) 
    3) Engage with someone (Watson IS?) to discuss issues associated with potential deployment ASAP
    4) Ensure you have a way of measuring how tasks are optimized and to what degree (even if it is a VERY simple measurement at first) 

    As you know I am anxious to see how I can help.
