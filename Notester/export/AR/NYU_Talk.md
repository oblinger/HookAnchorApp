    Learning System Management Procedures By Demonstration
    -----------------------------------------------------

    Technical support procedures are typically very complex.  Users often have
    trouble following printed instructions describing how to perform these
    procedures, and these instructions are difficult for support personnel
    to author clearly.  Our goal is to learn these procedures by demonstration,
    watching multiple experts performing the same procedure across different
    operating conditions, and produce an executable procedure that runs
    interactively on the user's desktop.  Most previous programming by
    demonstration systems have focused on simple programs with regular
    structure, such as loops with fixed-length bodies.  In contrast, our system
    induces complex procedure structure by aligning multiple execution traces
    covering different paths through the procedure.  

    In this talk I will presents an approach to this alignment problem using 
    Input/Output Hidden Markov Models.  In this approach we have extended the 
    basic Markov process with induced rule in each node.  I will present 
    initial results from this approach along with a demonstration of the 
    basic technology.
