    Computer systems are commonly used to perform procedures.  For
    example, typical business process tasks include requesting travel
    reimbursement, procuring a new workstation, or managing the payroll.
    System-management administrators follow best practice procedures for
    tasks such as configuring and optimizing email systems, and diagnosing
    and repairing network problems.  Finally, end users accumulate personal
    collections of procedures for accomplishing goals such as
    monitoring stock portfolios or collecting information for a
    presentation.

    Despite the ubiquity of these procedures, current systems provide
    little support for documenting or capturing procedural knowledge.
    Manuals and online documentation are costly to produce, difficult to
    consult, and often out-of-date.  Scripts that automate business
    processes are brittle, and expensive to maintain and upgrade.
    Infrequent users of a procedure often need to resort to more
    knowledgeable colleagues or to deskside support. 
    Without automation, frequent users of a
    procedure must repeat the same step over and over without the system
    adapting to the performed actions.

    The vision of the Personal Wizards project is to dynamically capture
    corporate and personal procedures through cross-application
    programming-by-demonstration.  The Personal Wizards system observes
    users performing procedures, captures keystrokes, mouse clicks, and
    system reactions, and abstracts semantically meaningful operations
    from these low-level observations.  The resulting traces are combined
    into an executable procedure representation that can guide a new user
    through a similar task, presenting the right information at the right
    time, and automatically executing steps in the procedure on behalf 
    of the user.


    This project addresses several interesting research problems.
    Current directions of investigation include:
    learning the structure of a procedure and generalizing individual
    steps from multiple traces created by different experts; creating
    human-understandable procedures; building executable procedures 
    that are robust to noise and failures; providing a graphical
    representation of the learned procedure; allowing the user to
    collaborate with the system during the execution phase; and combining
    learning and execution.
