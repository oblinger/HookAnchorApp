     Dan, 
     Sorry for the late reply. 
     Yes, I think NIPS is probably the best place to submit some theoretical work on the IOHMM. 
     As for Journal.  I would have  suggested  "neural computation", but the journal tends to be more and more oriented towards neuroscience.
     So, as for now,  the IEEE Pattern Analysis  and Machine Intelligence  (PAMI) or Elsevier journal "Machine Learning"  are probably the best places to publish your 
    results. 

    -Alain,



    zsh, evolution, strace, ethereal, 
    just trust me most points above the half line
    only beleve 30 ML problems. ha. ha.
    winnow
    Error Rate question dragged on and on
    boosting is great but they don't know why!!!
    didn't understand strong/weak classifier distinction

    I dont' know how impt that is (cvt to weak learner)  BUT you spent 10 min

    ==========

    ------------------
    - swallowing sniff and execution was very hard
      * We are doing well 

    - We got 'real' and all simplifying assumptions broke
      spent most of the 6 months making a first pass on these problems


    - talk about Why execution now?

    - No smoke and mirrors! good

    - Larry's pretty picture (tell them not to understand it)
    - Larry's execution entities: why do i care


    - Mixed initave not so exciting  attention<<>>intention


    Intro: need many APIs
    - did not descrbe meaning of slide (vit big slide)

    - pros and cons too detailed



    - Sim metric 
      

    changes to E-M 



    hopefully by the 18 month...
    on trail... simple case

    we are too timid

    =========================== 
    Hey Dan, 
     
    I seem to have lost the notes I was taking during yesterday's meeting.  Here's what I remember from memory: 
     
    Six-month milestone: 
    -- give up on wizard-of-oz studies 
    -- mock unix prototype 
    -- game plan for attacking Windows desktop 
    -- make progress on 12-month milestones ahead of time 
        -- implement core algorithms (not prototype) for learning procedures by demonstration 
        -- evaluate algorithms on simulated data 
     
    How's the fantasy football app coming along?  And hey, when's the housewarming? :)

    Do do these things we need PK methods for 
    - Generalizing from user executions 
    - Aligning mulitiple user executions 
    - UI methods for transparently executing macro

    . Build a convincing case that this is an open problem 
      and that the solution will have value to IBM 
      - deep research  
      - element of risk 
      - problem is different and solution is impt. 
      - what do you bring to the table 
      - what is the state of the art 
        - example systems 
      - full time 
      - great story 
      - plan for how to get there 
      - both: splash and academic merit 
      - explain how validation will be done 
        what metrics will we be using? 
     
     
      - Boldly differentiate the problem 
        convince of the value of a solution 
        Express our approach to the solution 
        Explain the state of art and where it falls short
