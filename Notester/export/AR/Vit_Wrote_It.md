    The Personal Wizards system captures and replays commonly performed
    computer-based procedures, such as creating travel reimbursement
    requests, configuring and optimizing e-mail servers, and diagnosing
    and repairing network problems.

    Personal Wizards goes beyond traditional macro-recorders: it observs
    the actions of multiple users as they perform such procedures, and
    combines them incrementally into an executable procedure model
    containing loops and decision points.  This human-readable and
    editable model serves as "follow-me" documentation: it can guide a new
    user through a similar task by providing in-context help as the
    procedure is performed manually, or by automatically executing steps.
