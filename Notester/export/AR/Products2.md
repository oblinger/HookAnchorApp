    SUPPORT.COM 
    support.com is a company whose products are used within IBM as one of the means to "deliver" support products. 
    support.com is essentially a framework + infrastructure for delivery of solutions. For example, it provides a way of encapsulating small probing applications in java beans, deliver the probing application to a customer's machine, where it would be run, it would determine if actions are necessary (e.g., if an upgrade is needed), send a request for the appopriate applications to be downloaded through the same channel, and run them.   They also offer consulting and actual customer support services. 
     
    A lot of their buzzwords are indeed buzzwords.  I have some literature, probably out-of-date (1 year old), on what they offer.   
     
    We were considering the support.com infrastructure as a way of delivering my CIM Crawler application to customers, run it, and retrieve the results.   
     
    I have a contact in Beaverton: someone who would be interested in troubleshooting/configuring applications of our AR technology. 
    His name is David Rizzo.   I have not contacted him yet, we should talk more before we actually go ahead with this.
