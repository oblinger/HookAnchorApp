# AR.43\_Rod --

    Rod Smith - VP, Emerging Technology
    David Boloker - CTO, Emerging technology
    Andrew Donoho - reports to David Boloker
    Ralph Pollock - Director, Software strategy

    Both Ralph and Rod report to Danny Sabbah (VP, SWG strategy and technology), who reports to Steve Mills.

    Quite a roomful of execs we had there.  If anyone took notes on suggested next steps, or on the questions Rod asked, I'd like to get a copy of them.


    Rod suggested we look at "StrikeIron", which supports visual assembly of web services.  Names that came up for us to talk to are: Loretta Jones, Sam Adams, and Sandy Rankin.
