# AR.rules\_of\_engagement --

    I propose the following rules of engagement, to keep the process slender and agile

    >  Distributed Decision Making (as appropriate)
    >  When important decisions are to be made by the entire group:
        - the group must be aware of the problem to be discussed in advance
        - each person is allowed to present one's point of view ININTERRUPTED for a finite period of time (5 minutes, no exception)
          in a round-robin fashion
       -  a question-and-answer session of finite length (10-15 minutes) follows
        - a rebuttal session follows (3 minutes per person, uninterrupted)
        - the question is settled by voting 
        - if necessary, the question is settled in front of John.
    > We do not revisit decisions unless there is new information that at least 50% of the group feels is 
        of sufficient importance to warrant revisiting the decision.
    > We do not question John's decisions unless new evidence appears (e.g., Eclipse vs. Portal).
    > Coin tossing is an allowed method of breaking ties (as in the Portal vs. Eclipse case, making the wrong
        decision early, Portal, is better than making the right decision much later).
    > We DOCUMENT decision processes and discussions.   We all seem individually to have a very 
        short memory and not to trust the collective memory.
