    - pooter and alan ganek said:  "if it was robust enough to support some usage with benefits above bar then we would be interested."

    - Steve: 

    - John's idea:
      - first time you use PW it doesn't help
      - second time you start getting benefit

    - Do an evaluation of IR.  

    Two Things John wants
    <<>>  how hard to do ganek demo
    <<>>  suite of benchmarks

    Tom Meran (Lotus is excited about this stuff)
    - what instrumentation would be needed on an application/platform

    Internal demo for group
    ... Meet with three people in the product divisions:  Alan Ganak, Pooter, (ask bazel)
        Goals of this meeting: Identify scenerios, and strategies for us
    ... Have scenerio and demo for web/portal

    - Remind pooter

    =====
    We should go up to talk to Pooter at Lotus and demo what we have.

    The big question is what our technology can and cannot do.

    Rich client will happen: SWG is in trouble if it doesn't happen.  Rod Smith is behind Flash, not Eclipse, as the underlying platform, because of better streaming over the internet; though Vas Bala (Watson) has demonstrated how to stream Eclipse classes.

    Comments on May '04 milestones: we need analysis.  (1) What can your system do and not do?  (2) How do we change the way we (IBM) builds applications?  E.g., the comment long ago from John Sweitzer: this tells me that I need to build my autonomic platform in a way that exposes more semantics about actions.

    Concrete suggestion: deliver a report on #2.  For example, say what we can do with no support from the application (what we do now).  What more could we do when the app gives us more info?  And so on.  We still don't know what this means yet, but I suggested drafting a report in the next 1-2 weeks and bringing it to our next group meeting for feedback.

    Another suggestion for May milestones: we should talk to 3 people in product divisions.  (1) Alan Ganek,  (2) Pooter at Lotus (Carl Krenzel sp?), (3) a DE in the deskside support area following Vittorio's contacts.  The idea is not to sell our stuff, but to engage them in the technology and get input on how it could be related to their area.

    By November: we should have a good scenario, not necessarily a working demo.  Ideally we'd come up with some kind of external demo we could distribute.  The idea is to get other people to help us show off our technology so we don't have to do it all ourselves.  How do we come up with this scenario?  By socializing with people in product divisions (DE's or higher) and engaging them in the technology.

    Talk for Alan Ganek: show tie-in to ISC early in presentation.  Start with ISC/ACT-I proposal text as a base.  Ask questions of him: does this make sense?  with what timeline?  Send JohnT the slides soon so he can look them over.

    Feedback on ACT-I proposal: choose a specific, concrete scenario, and commit to doing that.  Use that to focus development effort, don't build everything general, take shortcuts to get just this one scenario working.  Get KB to help us identify the scenario.  Possibly even write the web application ourselves: make instrumentation a non-issue.  Once we get people convinced our technology is useful, engage them in figuring out how to give us the instrumentation data we require.

    JohnT's take on why we shouldn't do any more work extending Windows instrumentation: assume that he's wrong, and there is a strategic play on Windows.  We'd still get a bigger bang for our buck by working on learning at this point rather than robustifying the Windows instrumentation.

    Why he doesn't think there's a strategic play on Windows:  (1) it's a constantly moving target.  (2) We don't own it.  (3) With the deskside support play, we'd be reducing expenses rather than increasing revenue.  Dan said, couldn't we advertise the use of PW technology to bring in more contracts?  John replied, if we did, then Microsoft would step in with their own solution and marginalize our business.
