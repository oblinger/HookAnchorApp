# AR.2a11-Funding --

    * Idea: 
      - collaboratively map out application; guide users thru app 
        Big gain: right info at the right time. 
     
      - Synergistic with much of the AC work 
        (We assist where automation is not possible) 
     
      - What is the platform for the console? 
        When will it exist? 
        - beta end of oct. 
        - beta in Mar - July (questionabel) 
        When will it be used and by how many people? 
        If we won funding, would it be best for us to start testing on  
          a related web-based application?
