# DARPA.Meeting.Ron Brachman at DARPA TECH --

    RON BRACHMAN

    - Zero sum?  Ideas (conceptual turf), Tony, Performers, Setas


    SETA SUPPORT
    -  BFM from Jenette Milos.  (Have them manage schedule, especial offsite visits)
    -  Technical seta:  New PHD from AI.  written/slide material, fill in WS etc.
    -  Ex-PM consultant who knows Tony: Sears, burke
       peter selfridge  (SET)       let Jenette know about how this 

    - How do I get high-level advice on my program ideas?


    How to push Big AI in DARPA.
    - Selling it
      - Motivate by nearer goals  (ladder climbing for buisness process) meet w. mil, movtivate by big AI the DARPA-hard part of general learning, 

    - mary mida has mil context.


    >> bootstrapping microworld needed;  

    Moving forward fast
    - Seed money to flesh out a single ladder       ( K needed to encode a micro-world is not so controvercial )
      - Training tasks
      - Convergent (multi-modal) training data
      - Domain components.
      * ENCODE K needed to solve ladder
      * Imagine learning path to obtain that knowledge
    - Finding technical SETA.  funding them before joining DARPA.

    - go trough "simple" text book and see if the steps are ML.


    My Agenda:  Learning micro-worlds from human like inputs.
    - implies a different decomposition for the whole problem of AI:  split off background/commonsense K and input abstraction away from knowledge integration.
    - implies an architecture
    - implies a novel set of learning tasks
    - Benefits:  Datasets (ladder),  Lego components 
    - Imagine new community of researchers focusing on learning the ladder


    ** Ladder modality data,
       Ladder tasks

    ** Ladder competencies  (spatial reasoner, constraint sat, commonsense knowledge)

    ** Learning components

    -- Toplevel system


    Three or four meetings
    - I have a high-level agenda.  but w. specific choices built in   
      (1) is that appropriate
      (2) how to best draw in:  enthusiasm.  new ideas.


    - My "big" thinking is to create a new AI agenda, based on a complex test bed & driving challenge.
      - Release test bed, release components, workshops/conferences, journal issues.
    - What else should I be doing?
