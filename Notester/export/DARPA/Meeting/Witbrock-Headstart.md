    AGENDA
    * GOALS:
      - A White paper:
        - Define specific BL agenda, and justify that it can be solved in three years.
        - Provide starting point for performers, so rapid *collaborative* progress is possible from day 1.
        - Select two domains and build detailed bootstrapping stories for them:
          Story includes example represented knowledge for each step in the process, and a
          description of the algorithms  and interactions of the learning step.
      - Have fun.  We will get more/better work accomplished if we structure this
        in a way that makes this our most fun task.  (e.g. by getting support for the parts that do not interest us)
    * So how do we attack this task?   
    * How do we bring others to get fast results and not waste too much money?
    * What about David Page?   (Jude Shavlik)






    AND THERE BE DRAGONS THERE
    * Abstracting a new representation & inducing the mapping functions
    * Glueing components to build hybrid components
    * Building components that allow for flexible specialization and varienting



    EARLY THINKING  --  IMMEDIATE GOAL: BL WHITE PAPER
    * For each Representation/API:  chose candidate, plus alternatives.
      - Each candidate has a description and references
      - The chosen candidate is what we use in building our system sketch
    * The Ladder API:  NLP, Diagram, Demonstrations, Reasoning, Feedback, Gestures
    * The Bootstrapping API: much more up for grabs... see pitch
    * Set of learning processes.  By demonstation, iterative refinment, 
      - Each learning process as a set of input APIs, output APIs, an interaction profile,
        and often specializations of the APIs
    * Set of learning paradigms

    * Learned and native components.
      Must wrestle with the issue of what compoents are native (for a given ladder and which are to be learned)
      Must wrestle with the level of generality for components
      Must wrestle with the component spec that is bootstrappable:
      - Given native component X, must derive X' a specialization with all functionality of a native component
      - Given learned component X, must derive specialization X', with all funcitonality
      - Given component X, must derive varient component X', with all funcitonality

    * Understand how we apply many constraints to learn glue code that spans different representations

    * Must pick a second domain:  UAV control.  Training simulation authoring.

    * Background Documents:
      - The current pitch
      - The electronic 



    END AGENDA
    * Next steps?
    * When do we meet again?  with whom?
