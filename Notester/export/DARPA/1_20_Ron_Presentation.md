    ===================================

    TONY IS INTERESTED IN
    - what is leraning about at its core
    - fundamentals of ML.

    NEED TO SHOW TONY
    - clues that you can do it   (Previous<<>>related work)

    GOAL
    - keep them from gaming

    Bumper sticker stmt: 
      *truely* cumulative learning   bootstapped  ladder

    TEST BED DOMAIN
    Intro to VLSI system (mead & conway)

    More imaganitive examples 

    DOMAINS WHERE TECHNOLOGY COULD APPLY
    Places where this could be applied:  Tax Law

    WHAT WE NEED FOR A PITCH
    - Concrete examples of the experimental design
      - 3 year. w. 18 month checking
    - What are the objective measuresments
    - Setup: locked room; amount of time.

    problem domains refect the rich structure   (what is the difference in the domains)
    - not flat vector in <<>> out in the testing

    [[SLIDES]]
    - how pieces come together
    - show ladder  (concepts at different level)
    - test problem domains (test protocals)
    - milestones metrics   (w<<>>o bias  w bias)
    - key problems to crack

    - picture that shows all effects are needed

    KEY IDEA SLIDE:  combinging sources

    bottom up <<>> top down combinging
