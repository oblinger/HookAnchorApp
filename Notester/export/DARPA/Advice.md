    * For every one of my deliverables, nominate someone to be in charge of that detail
    * For every deliverable, have a date  (ask deliverer to choose such a date)
    * At common meetings we should present summary stuff and say:  Everybody agree?  resolve conflicts offline.
    * Do not assume 100% funding usage on day 1

      * A quad chart for each node in the org tree
      * An explanation of what capability would be lost if funding was cut
