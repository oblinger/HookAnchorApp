# Negotiating\_strategies --


    - Never, Never, provide a salary figure.
    - Figure what your minimum is, but never tell.
      - if they are above, then accept.  else say too low, but never say how much too low.


    - when asked say for a salary you say, #1, if they push, then #2, if they push then #3
      #1 I am much more interested in doing (type of work) 
           here at (name of company) than I am in the size of the initial offer.
      #2 I will consider any reasonable offer.
      #3 You are in a much better position to know how much I'm worth to you than I am.
           so what am I worth.
