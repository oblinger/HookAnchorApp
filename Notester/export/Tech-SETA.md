    ###  KEY CONSIDERATIONS  ###
    ############################
      (1)  MULTIPLY:  Right-hand  Excited/proactive/high-standards/figuresItOut/keep-on-top-of-it
           -->  will be conscious of your time;  keep it interesting; cool work.  push into new areas
      (2)  Can produce written polished materials and slides
      (3)  Can handle delegated high-level assignments & can coordiante activities of others.
      (4)  Understands DARPA.
      (5)  Deep understanding of AI.

    ! Understands AI/ML well enought to:
    ! Can organize & track activities w little oversite
    ! Can xlate ideas from one format to another w/o help.  E.g:  Can write my WAR report
    - Can organize a workshop w/o
    - Has some stature among AI/ML reserchers  (they will pay some attention to them)

    complete    slides    - not kill on one    - find motivators

    * Travel with me
    * Keep wiki of open activities; resolve issues
    * Master control of changes on important documents

    Barney has a broad vision for the field and programmatic ways that
    we can change the way research is done (e.g., his work on Metagame
    preceded Mike Genesereth's work on GGP by ten years). He would be
    great for a workshop.

    Ron has a broad background in cognitive systems and, although quiet,
    would make a great SETA. Unless his company has really taken off, I
    suspect he would be open to such a support role, though John Laird
    and I might need to help you convince him.
