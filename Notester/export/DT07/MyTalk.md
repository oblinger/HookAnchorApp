    12-15 minutes; the rule of thumb is 125 words per minute---so 1500-1800





    All
     
    Here is the required format for all DARPATECH presentations.  The email below is consistent with the discussions we had with Bob Hummel.  
     
    that their talk is supposed to follow the format;

    1. This is our dream where we want to be in this (fill in the blank)

    2. This is where we are today

    3. These are the barriers we have to overcome to get there from here.

    4. We are looking for ideas to overcome the barriers and here are some that might help do it.

    The opening by the OD's should follow this format as well except oriented towards an overarching vision, etc.

    Perhaps the summaries provided by Bob et al assumed that they were doing that. But I am concerned that the speakers don't know the format.

    I'll mark up what I have and give it back. But make sure that your speakers understand."
