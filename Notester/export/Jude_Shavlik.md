    "Dan,

    Sorry we didnt get a chance to talk more at AAAI.

    I'm attaching something I wrote with Ray Mooney
    for Ted Senator last fall, on the "advice giving" approach to ML.
    I think it has a lot in common with your research views,
    and of course I'd be glad to talk more about it.

    Sorry if you get two copies of this email.
    I'm not sure if your IBM address is still active.

    By the way, have you moved to DC?  I'll
    be in DC next Mon-Weds, so if you're there and would like
    to talk in person, that would be great.  In any case,
    best wishes for the new job!

    Jude
