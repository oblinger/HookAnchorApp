    Hi Anci, 
     
    I just got you new pictures.  Thanks alot!!  I should have my roomate take a picture of me and my kitten to send to you too. 
     
    Please tell your Mom, Dad, and sisters "thanks" for the picture too! 
     
    Are you having fun in school?  I have only been out of school for 2 years, and I already miss it!  Still I get to take short classes here at work, that is nice. 
     
    Please tell me about your classes and what you are learning.  I wonder if they are the same things I learned in 3rd grade.  (Is that right? are you in 3rd grade) 
     
    Goodbye for now.  Your friend, Dan
