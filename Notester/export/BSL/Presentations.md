    #18 Ladder (1)
    - Focus on the domain independent of learning new problem representations from "near" "simplier" problem representations.
    - Arrange K in pedagogically motivated ordering, take "small" learning steps.

    - Simplification #1:  Take tiny steps.
    - Simplification #2:  "Help the learning algorithm"   carefully construct ladder.

    IMPT:  We did not give simplify the domain independance!
    - Simplification #3:  Focus on the problem set up problem.   Dont worry about how to get the background K need for any given learning "step"

    IMPT:  We did not give up on bootstrapping.  Learning *EVERYTHING* needed for the next rung.


    #19 Ladder (2)
    - Convergent Knowledge modalities
    - problem:  we can't use ML to learn: structure
    - soln:  Dont use ML.  humans don't discover complex K.  They copy it.  lets do the same
    - Marriage of Generative methodologies w. selective methodologies









    Focus on learning from a TEACHER. 

    Expand sources of K considered by ML

    Synthesize
