    <<>>
    SMALL STEPS
    * Explosive processes are controlled by only permitting very small steps to  be taken
    * Solutions to complex tasks must be obtained incrementally
    * Thus we need a teacher who knows what system is intended to learn
    COMPOSITIONAL ACQUISITION
    * Complex system is learned from simple universal components

    <<>>
    REIFICATION
    * Any recurring pattern can be reified into a symbol
    * When that pattern occurs the symbol will be activated in the future
    * This provides basic generalization
    FLATTENING
    * xlate first-order expressions into symbols

    <<>>
    HOLOGRAPHIC INFERENCE  
    * Exponential number of ways to combine knowledge in any situation, instead
      system thinks about them 'all at once'.  Simplifies retrieval and inference, but 
      requrires that 'inappropriate' retrievals be filtered.
    * Also relies on the sparsity of interesting concepts in the space
      of all possible concepts
    * Becuase REIFICATION sets up tapered rewrites we can rely on it
      to help narrow remindings to appropriate remindings.
      e.g. the difference between gift and theft 

    <<>>
    SELF-LIMITING REWRITING
    * Though learned associations, each concept is linked with other concepts.
    * Transitively most all concepts are linked.
    * Some subsets of the links are expansive, that is if the transitive closure
      over these links covers a large fraction of all concepts.
    * Tapering links are exactly the opposite.  Transitive closures computed over
      these links tend to be small from most any starting point--following these 
      links 'peters' out with a relatively small number of linked concepts.
    * Tapered rewriting is a constant time operations (with a large constant)
      thus the brain can afford to always perform tapering rewrites.
    * The brain can automatically learn to identify an follow tapering links.
    * Multiple inheritance taxononmy trees are but one example of tapering rewrites.
      e.g. Dan work at the Hawthorne lab, works at watson, at IBM, is an employee,
           is a human, is a mammal, is an animal, is a thing.
