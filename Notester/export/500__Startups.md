    Welcome to the 500 Startups Accelerator program! Me, Melissa and Max will be your primary contacts here and you should read this email carefully -- there's a lot to cover.
    Information on access to the building/space,  (TL;DR -- clean up after yourselves, Melissa is the boss, don't randomly invite non-500 people unless you're babysitting them.)
    The program officially kicks off on 10/10 -- we'll meet at noon PST to kick things off. You may begin moving in as early as 10/3 -- 
    please check-in with me or Melissa when you arrive at the office.

    We will be assigning desks. Note that we may just have you grab any available desk when you arrive and then we'll begin the formal shuffle once most of the class is here. 
    Please be ready/willing to adapt - this is going to be a fun four months. :)

    EVERY member of your team must fill out this form. You will not be assigned desks and your team will not be added to any of our official mailing lists until we've 
    received your responses to this form.

    Please email melissa@500startups.com to be added to the Space Reservations calendar. After a founder has been added to the Space Reservations calendar he or she can add 
    other members of the team. Space Reservation Instructions
    We also have a 500 Jobs list: <<>> This one is open to others and all messages are moderated.

    If we haven't discussed already, you should be updating your AngelList profile often -- we'll discuss more at the kick off.
    First step, you need to add either me (paul@500startups.com), Dave (dave@500startups.com) or Christine (christine@500startups.com) as a current investor in your company. 
    You should only add one of us and it should be whichever of us was your primary contact for the investment.
    You should add angellist@500startups.com as an incubator in your company.
    To be clear, please do NOT share any of these things with anyone outside of your team.

    Welcome to the Family, we're all excited to have you here. :) If you have any questions or concern, feel free to contact me at any time.
