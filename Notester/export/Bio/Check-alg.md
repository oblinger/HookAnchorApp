# Bio.Check-alg -- Verification of bio. knowledge & algorithms

    - Check varience in tables generated from random subsets of the data 
    - Change end gap weighting 
     
     
     <<>>     
     
    >   Check the varience of Exposure & Str verses basic 
        Measure euclidiean distance between tables 
     
    look at bad sets 
    look at delta in AAP 
    - look at random table min rms 
    random combo error 
     
    - compare to tom's avg. z-score.  944 pairs in same fold. 
    - check in LISP & Cs z-scores are same. 
    - look at - aap tables for A-table, B-table 
    - Linear interpolation of MDM78 & identity 
    - Look at absolute differences in various squares being used. 
      Are they different enough to cause different alignments?? 
      (perhaps abs diff should be compared to diff. between eles in basic  
      table)
