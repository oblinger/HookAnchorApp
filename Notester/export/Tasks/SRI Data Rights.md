# Tasks.SRI Data Rights --

    DanO needs to decide whether or not to discuss with SRI subs by phone

    Summary: USC ISI (SRI sub) has requested alternate I be added to the DFARS 252.227-7013 (technical data) and 252.227-7014 (computer software) in order to afford protection of publication rights.

    Chronology:

    - Determine what guarantees we already have (e.g. do we have BSD or open source?)  answer - BSD + Apache 2.0
    - Determine whether or not the inclusion of Alt I indeed afford the desired protection.  answer - it would allow them to publish first and then notify the contracting officer; according to Pollock, this avoids the DARPA vetting process and should not be allowed because they do not qualify as 6.1 (contracted fundamental research)
