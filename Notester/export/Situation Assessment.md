# Situation Assessment --

    Dan,


    The process of IPB ("intelligence preparation of the battlespace") takes place continuously at every echelon, from the Pentagon, to combatant commander in a unified command (geographic sector of the world, e.g., CENTCOM), to a JTF commander, on down to a platoon commander.  It provides an assessment of the entire battlespace of interest to the unit.  It includes environment (terrain, weather), own force status, enemy status, predicted enemy courses of action, etc.  The definition from Joint Publication 2-01.3 ("Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace"):
    Intelligence preparation of the battlespace.
    An analytical methodology employed to
    reduce uncertainties concerning the enemy,
    environment, and terrain for all types of
    operations. Intelligence preparation of the
    battlespace builds an extensive data base
    for each potential area in which a unit may
    be required to operate. The data base is
    then analyzed in detail to determine the
    impact of the enemy, environment, and
    terrain on operations and presents it in
    graphic form. Intelligence preparation of
    the battlespace is a continuing process.
    Also called IPB.


    If a commander needs the answer to a question(s) about a specific situation or issue, s/he creates a commander's information requirement (CIR).  When the CIR has to be answered by intelligence analysis (as opposed to logistics analysis, own-force status assessment, etc.), it is called a priority intelligence requirement (PIR).  These can come from the President on down to a squad leader.


    A report or briefing that is a formal response to a PIR is an called an "intelligence estimate".  The President and Congress get NIEs (National Intelligence Estimates).  There was a (in)famous NIE produced before invading Iraq.  The definition:
    Intelligence estimate. The appraisal,
    expressed in writing or orally, of available
    intelligence relating to a specific situation
    or condition with a view to determining
    the courses of action open to the enemy or
    potential enemy and the order of probability
    of their adoption.


    If the product summarizes what is known about one geographic area of operation (and typically produced by computer on a graphical map with overlays, popups, drilldowns, etc.) it is often called a "common operating picture" (COP).


    In Baghdad today CPOF (Command Post of the Future), a DARPA system, is in use 24x7 to support IPB plus command & control (C2) (targeting, deployment, etc., decisions).  In this system there are two formal briefings each day, a BUB (Battlefield Update Briefing) and a CUB (Commanders' Update Briefing), that attempt to summarize all of the IPB plus C2 status.  These are the CPOF variant of what is usually called the daily (or twice daily) "commander's briefing".


    The products of IPB are supposed to give a commander situation or situational awareness.  The process of creating the products is often termed situation assessment.
