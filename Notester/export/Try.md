     A nice (free) Jazz club in Harlem you may one to try. Problably better than Smalls.

    248 W. 132nd St.
    (7th <<>> 8th)

    The free Sunday evening jam session begins 7:00 P.M. until the hall closes at midnight. The kitchen serves up a heaping plateful of reasonably priced and delicious soul food.   And the warm weather months are enjoyed on a beautiful back patio.  Seleno Clarke keeps the spirit of defunct jazz club, La Famille, alive with his tasteful licks on Hammond B-3 organ and an international trio of sidemen help anchor the weekly jam session.  The drink prices are by far the best in town, and the familial atmosphere is even better than that.  Jazz music has been added on Wednesday with a midweek jam session hosted by guitarist, Tom Halpenny from 8-midnight, and Saturday nights with big time local talent, Sheldon Sweeper on pocket trumpet; French drummer, Renaud Penant, leads the band on Thursdays.  Note:  You are required to sign a guest book as you enter, but there is never a cover charge or minimum.  Seating is very limited so early arrivals are rewarded - if you do take a table please do support the venue by ordering something from the bar or kitchen.  If you're a musician be prepared to sit in.
