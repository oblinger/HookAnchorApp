                                     MY PERSONAL INFO TREE
      
    - This is the root of your info tree.  Organize it anyway you like.

    - When you first create a Topic or Project it will be located under <<>> or <<>>
      you can put it under a note here, by simply setting its parent (using TAB-P) to point to 
      this note, or a note under this note.
