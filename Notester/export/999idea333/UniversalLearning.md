    - T-learning (overcomes dataset fragmentation, but so does 
      accumulative??? rule learning)

    * bias is output from leraning 
    * Computable 
    * Small lex delta means limited hypspace delta 
    * Understandable 
     
    - Concepts are recursively built up from constituents automatically 
      as thinking is occuring.

    We can build complete-control systems,  
    - we dont have systems that bootstrap rep & alg. 
    - we wont program the first thinking machine  (except at the lowest level) 
      we wont even architect the most interesting peices 
     
    Is common sense reason primal or ephemeral in human cog processing? 
    Is FO-like (variable binding) resoning primary or ephemeral? 
     
    right rep @ right time.
