    Idea:  Get unlimited energy from self replicating space based system.


    Major issues:
      *  Unlimited sources of raw material
         -  Place appropriately (near earth)
         -  Appropriate materials
      *  Space-based energy transmission

      *  Solar energy conversion

      *  Replicating factory


    Factory parts
    - Structure
    - Containment
    - Precise components
    - Locomotion
    - Control
    - Sensing
    - CPU
