    + CONTACT: Find out who your students are (if you are joining the process now),  
        who their managers/mentors are 
    * Try to communicate with the students beforehand and let them know how  
      to contact you 
    * Make sure they have seen all the information available on 
      <<>> 
      (user "student" password "summer2k") 
    * Mention the discussion database 
    * Mention the list of employment documents for the first day 
    * Point them to Watson-specific housing information. 
    * Talk to the managers and mentors 
    * COMPUTER, SEAT, Make sure there are computers and space for the students 
    * NOTES. Most important: make sure there is a computer from which they  
    * FIRST DAY.  Make sure there is someone to greet them on the first day  
    * NO IDS communicate to the managers that they should not obtain Notes IDs 
    HR will give out disks with IDs on the morning of the first day 
     
    Beyond the first day, I see our role as a big set of "ears" to listen to students concerns.  Try to anticipate and seek problems. How? I would just check on my students once in a while and see if they are OK.  Do not expect them to come to you with problems! 
    Do send me comments/questions. I will disseminate any extra information promptly.
