    Dr. Oblinger is focused on scalable approaches for knowledge acquisition, typically applying inductive learning, but in rich environments where time, interaction, and structure make the traditional "vector of features" model ineffective.  He is currently serves as a Program Manager at DARPA running the Machine Reading and Bootstrapped Learning programs.  Prior to this he was a research staff member at IBM T.J. Watson Labs where he developed inductive algorithms appropriate for a range to tasks from predicting speech/reading deficiencies to work in Programming By Demonstration.
