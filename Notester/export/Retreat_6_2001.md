    It is not clear where the bounbaries of sin are, but it is clear  
    that I have crossed them. 
    This is my undoing. 
    This is wrong. 
     
    God does not want me to live in a state of fear, but he does want me to  
    live in a state of humble striving.  This is right & it is the only way  
    to happiness. 
     
    It is right to be thankful & happy about what I have 
    and it is right to strive, but to strive in the right spirit. 
    This is the way to happiness, it is ok to be motivated by this  
    goal of happiness, but also be motivated because it is right. 
     
    Relationship w. Yoshiko is not deep enough 
     
    Giving myself over to God is not giving myself over to arbitrary will  
    of another, but rather giving myself over to what I know is right. 
     
    I kngw that i will ultimately fail 
    still everyday i will try to be better, i will strive 
    harder still i should not let anything be "off limits" 
     
    Resolutions: 
    - Begin each day @ work w. a prayer & offer day to God. 
    - Be conscious of God thru the day in work & deed. 
    - Sporadically strive for a deeper understanding of God.
