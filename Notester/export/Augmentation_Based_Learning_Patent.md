        Augmentation Based Learning 

    PROBLEM:  
    [Claims]
    - Learning from a 





    The problem this patent addresses is the problem of learning a procedure incrementally from 
    sequence of demonstrations of that procedure.  A solution to the problem will accept an initial
    partial model of the underlying procedure, and a sequence of steps executed by the underlying procedure.
    The system will then extend the input partial procedure to incorporate steps observed.  Repeated application of
    this process can be used to extend the initial (possibly) empty procedure to incorporate all of the steps and logic
    in the underlying procedure. 

    We teach a solution to this problem that relys on a class of procedure transformations call 'augmentations'.
    A transformation that of procedure A into procedure B, is called an AUGMENTATION of that procedure if 
    the new procedure is consistent with all of the demonstration sequence cons


    An augmentation is a transformation function which accepts an input procedure
