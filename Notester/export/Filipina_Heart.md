    In US culture, I am a few years too old to attract the mate that really matches me.

    I am warm, loyal, emotionally stable.  I am intelligent and energetic.  I have a wide circle of friends, an extrovert, with an openess to new adventures.

    While I don't want to loose all of that adventure, I am ready to settle down.
    Still I want to settle down with a good match -- in energy, in spirituality, and in intelligence -- so I am not going to rush things, but the long term is where by focus it.



    My match: an education and interest in things, a positive person with energy for life, and a good person with a good heart.
    I promise you, I <<>> those things just in a package this is 10 years older than he is supposed to be.
