    MOTIVATION
    $ - Domain Modeling is impt.  (ILP vs. OP5) 
      - Tools needed (give little vs. give lot) tightly controlled
      - Developed frame & applied to HHM problem in biological sciences
    $ Refinement of conventional induction (n-hyp spaces)
    $ Methods
      + Refinement Space = Ambiguity in Expertise
      + Library of ambiguity types.
        ``Set of factors'' bias
      + Decomposition
        (1) Independent Optimization
        (2) Intermediate Observation
    $ Car Example
    $ Library of specialized biases: (Space of parametric fns vs. Set of functions)
    $ Set of factors bias.
    $ Independent Optimization  (Amt of Gas vs. Amt of Rain)
    $ Intermediate Observation  (Engine block looked wet)
    $ OUTLINE: 1st stab @ framework; Results on factors bias str.; 
               HHM prob; Results in HHM; proposed work; Conclusions.
    FRAMEWORK
    $ Influent syntax:  Rule-based.  terms=spaces.  Types & Annotated for bias.
    ? Examples of influents.
    $ Framework block diagram
    $ Framework w. car example
    $ EMPIRICAL EVALUATION OF SPECIALIZED BIAS STRENGTH
      (Theory + Graphs)
    HHM PROBLEM
    $ 20 Amino Acids
    $ Primary vs. Tertiary str.
    $ FUTURE WORK
      - Specialized hyp. spaces: Experimental Documentation; Formal Specification
      - Intermediate observation: Experimental documentation; Incorporate into mod
    $ Multi-alignment
    $ Reordering Result
    $ CONCLUSIONS
    EXTRAS

    HHM Problem
    - Proteins: String of acids that foldup.
      Specific placement determines function.  Hemoglobin example
      Two amazing facts: only 20 acids.  Primary->tertiary is deterministic.
    - HHM problem
      Needleman Alignment of Mandelate Racemase <<>> Muconate Lactonizing Enzyme
      Seeing deep similarity, Impt. 'cause genome.
      Great L. prob: Well Def. Hard. Elect data. Critical. Poor perf still good.
    - Dayhoff Substitution Tables.  Capture deeper similarity.
      Need specialized tables: Threonine/Serine in A-helix.

    TO ADD
    - Slide w. top-level experiment functions
    - Slide w. top-level spec for GAP GOP experiment & GRID.
    - 1D-map
