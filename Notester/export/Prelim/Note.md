    XXXX: Order inputs to PI by varaibility between problems
      training data; plausible K; PICK; SPACE-SECIFIC IND ALGS.
    XXXX: two constraints appropriateness for computation/real domains
          thus we motivate from both sides: Look @ existing mech & examples of
          domain knowledge.
    XXXX: lessons: direct learning is best.  Try to break prob. into a
     direct sub-problem.  (By use of intermediate observation).
    XXXXXX Goals of approach:
      - Break bias into pieces.
      - Independent optimization of pieces when possible.
    XXXXXX Proposed Work
      - Cleanup Convergence Proofs
      - 1D Maps, Result: Test PI's ability to encode bio-K.
                         Secondarily test bio-intuitions themselves.
                         Thesis cannot depend on correctness of intuitions.
    XXXXXX PI splits ind. into ref. spaces   VERBAL ANALYSIS OF PI
      - avoid componential nature of ind.
      - absolutely necessary for bio problem where full concept is 100/1000s bits
      four ways:
      1 Use quasi-independance.
      2 Use intermediate observations
      3 Swallow nastyness in subspace use trick to handle subspace
      4 Swallow small nastyness in subspace. brute force gen&test.
      else your dead.
