# Proj.89JobRequest --

    Peter,  
      Here is a first shot at the Job spec.  I tried to aim generally 
    toward the intersection of Mary's skills and our needs without making 
    it overly obvious that we already had a candidate in mind. 
     
    I put some patriotic who-ha at the end.  I believe that what I said 
    reflects our group's goals, but maybe the BS level should be lowered a  
    notch or two.  (On the other hand I found other job posting with 
    similar visionary endings) 
     
    Anyway, slice and dice it as you see fit, or give me feedback and I  
    chew on it.  I haven't polished it much yet, I want to get the content 
    right first. 
     
    Thanks, Dan
