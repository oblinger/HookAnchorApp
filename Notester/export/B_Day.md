    MY SYSTEM FOR CARDS:   <<>>
    (1) Cards I send are grouped by the month prior to sending the card.
    (2) During beginning of month, I get cards out, address & tag them for 6 days prior to event.
    (3) Cards sit in holder next to desk.
    (4) On tagged date I write card and lay it on bookbag.
        (Once bookbag is in hand the card is not set down.)
    (5) CATEGORIES:  M-day, F-day, Easter, V-day/sweetest, 
        B-day KIDS(girl/boy)  FAM(mom/dad/dave

    MY SYSTEM:

    (1)  8pm calendar entry (for a phone call) on the day of the b-day itself.
    (2)  Every monday I check <<>> list.  If date after the '----' mark has passed then <<>>
         (a) Get all physical cards out & place sticky dated 5 days prior to the event. (avoid weekend dates)
             (will fill out card before then)
         (b) Either write e-card, or make Notester note.

    - KEY:  'P' means 8pm phone call; 'E' means e-card, 'C' means physical card, 'G' means gift
