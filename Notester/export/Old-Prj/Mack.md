    Jacob told me to talk w. you 
     
     
     
    At the 10X/CTC Assessment meeting in Tokyo, a very strong message from 
    the IBM Global Services team to the IBM Research team was: "We need 
    better ways to find out what is going on in IBM Research".  Responding 
    to that request, we have asked Bob Mack, manager of Information Design 
    and Access in my group, to launch work on technical solutions to that 
    problem.  We will begin this work with a User-Centric Design study in 
    which we analyze the problem from the users' point of view and develop 
    solution requirements.  My questions to you - our Services colleagues 
    - are: Who are the users in this situation and how do we engage with a 
    representative sample?  Can you help us make contact and begin the 
    interview process?  Separately, I also solicit your views on 
    organizational changes that would address this topic.
