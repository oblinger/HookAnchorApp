    I w 
    I am trying to tie text  
    and learning technologies developed here to 
     
    KM proposal for IGS 
    ------------------- 
     
    Global Service's primary asset is its people. 
    Understanding this asset is both difficult and crucial. 
     
    We propose a skill mining solution that generates a  
    profile for each employee, that can then be cataloged and serve as 
    a continuously up to day, serachable, flexible representation of the  
    organization. 
     
    There are many approaches one could take on this task.  We believe the 
    following attributes are crucial for success within the particular context 
    of IBM Global Services. 
     
    * We propose the mining of electronic comunications traffic, since it 
      is universal across the organization, contains the depth necessary 
      for skill inference, and because the mining of this data can be 
      done without placing any additional burdens on the IGS employees. 
     
    * Control of the mining process and the profile generated must remain 
      in with each employee.  This ensures that the privacy of each employee 
      is strictly maintained, and it ensures that the data generated has been 
      verified by the employee, thus increasing it accuracy. 
     
    * Mining should be on going so that skill data is kept up to date. 
     
    * Generated skills data should be in a format that can be replicated 
      so that skill information can be access, both on and off line. 
     
    We believe that Lotus notes/domino is a solid basis for this technology, and 
    we are seeking a partnership where Lotus and IBM resarch provide a skill 
    profiling solution designed to meet the needs of IGS.  We believe that such  
    an arrangement is ideal.  It leverages technologies and expertise in these 
    two organization, and provide a deployment pathway for the eventual solution.
