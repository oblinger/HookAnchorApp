    Notes To Vikram
    - Friends First.  
    - Nightmare is that one feels the other lost out.


    - Get few alpha testers
    - Polish crap out of code
    - Make system usable in first 60 seconds of use.

    - Protect IP with a patent

    - Release system; get many hooked on it.
    - Make system better (re-release and repeat)

    - Capitalize on:
      - Userbase
      - Patent
      - Design elements
      - The system itself
