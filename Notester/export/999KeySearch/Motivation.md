    THE PROBLEM 
     
    A significant task in a modern employee's work life is locating  
    resources and other information with in their own company.  This is 
    particularly true when (1) the company is large, and (2) the company 
    in knowledge intensive.  Becuase IBM at an extreme in both of these  
    attributes, any improvement in our ability to search our own intranet 
    will reap large benefits. 
     
    We have identified a class of intranet searches that we call 'reference 
    directed search.'  We will argue that: (1) This class of search represents 
    a significant fraction of all searches initiated by the employees with 
    in an organization.  (2) Employee efficacy in carrying out these 
    searches can be dramically improved through a particular extension to 
    the existing information infrastructure.  (3) The total cost of this 
    information extension is quite small relative to the resources 
    currently devoted to maintaining IBM's inforamtion infrastucture. 
    These costs are also outweighted both by simplifications they bestow on 
    the maintainance of the information infrastracuture, and are far 
    outweighed if one balances them agaist the unmeasured but dramatic cost 
    of all employee time lost is searching (or failing to find) 
    intranet-based resources. 
     
     
    REFERENCE DIRECTED SEARCH 
     
    A Reference Directed Search is a search of the organization's intranet 
    undertaken by an individual who knows the "reference name" of the 
    resource or information sought.  A reference name (rname) is a 
    multi-word term that is commonly used to refer to a resource or 
    collection of resources.  For example the "IBM Application Locator,"  
    "IBM Benefits," the "Speech group," and the "Summer student mailing 
    list" are all possible rnames. 
     
    While we assume that that an individual making a reference directed 
    search does know the rname of the resource sought, we do not assume 
    anything about their knowledge about where the support for 
    that resource falls with in the organization.  Nor do we assume that 
    the seeker has any knowledge about how that resource is situated 
    on the intranet.  In particuar the seeker does not know what 
    organization is even responsible for indexing the resource. 
     
     
    WHY IS REFERENCE DIRECTED SEARCH SO IMPORTANT 
     
    Searching a large intranet in a loosely directed fashion is difficult.   
    Because of this we believe that the great majority of intranet 
    searches are undertaken only when the searcher knows of the ex 
     
    It is our belief that  
    The majority of 
     and generally not attempted unless 
    one has has a  
     
    Often the impetus to perform a search of an organization's intranet 
    also provides an rname of the resource sought.

     significantly improved through a

    * Universal name addressing (No info fiefdoms). 
    * Completely agnostic about resource Representation, Format, Storage
