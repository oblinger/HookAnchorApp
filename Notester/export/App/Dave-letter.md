    Dave, 
     
    My research specialization is Machine Learning <<>> data&text mining. 
    I am interested in the human skills mining problem, and am particularly 
    interested in mining skills from electronic communications. 
     
    I have looked at the problem of mining human skill categories, and  
    believe that there are significant practical advantanges in considering 
    mining electronic communications in particular.   
    Electronic communications are ubiquitous, and signicant skill information is 
    inherient in the both the content and structure of electonic communicatons. 
     
    I am interested building skill mining technology on top of standard  
     
     to be made by utilizing structure inherent in 
    the content and flow of electronic communications. 
     I beleve that their is 
     
     
     
    s from electronic  
    communications. 
     
     mining problem, and believe their are significant, 
    practical gains to be made by utilizing structure inherent in 
    the content and flow of electronic communications. 
     
    To maximize the chances that my efforts in this area result 
    in a significant impact 
     
    Gains made within research are best received when they translate into 
    concrete gains for important products.  In order for this to happen, 
    the entire research program should be developed with a comprehensive 
    understanding of the environement where the work might be deployed. 
     
    This is my goal here.  I hope to understand (1) if 
    electronic-communications mining for skills is an important component 
    for Yoda/Raven, and (2) what tools, languages, methodologies must I 
    adopt in order for progress here to translate into benefits there.
