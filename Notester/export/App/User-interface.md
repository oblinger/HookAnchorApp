# App.User-interface --

    The administrator will use a folder/subfolder type interface to create 
    and maintain a taxonomy of human expertise.  Each category will have a 
    label, a short description of that type of expertise, and a rule or a 
    weighted set of terms used to identify employees that have this 
    expertise. 
     
    The administrator also manages a list of employees, email contacts, 
    and some authentication mechanism used by the empolyee to update their 
    profile. 
     
     
    The employee interface authenticates an employee and then allows them to 
    edit their expertise profile.
