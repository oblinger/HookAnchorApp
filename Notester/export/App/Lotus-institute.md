    BACKGROUND 
    - Doing datamining work w. email 
    - Talked w. Cathy Lasser about Expertise Locator. 
    - Realized that inference of this K was similar to current work 
    - No point in reinventing the wheel; can we build on or support your work 
      perhaps some collaboration is possible. 
     
    THE PROJECT 
    - Status? 
    - Release (to research; as beta; product announce) 
    - Who is the project manager? 
    - Who will maintain it? 
     
    - At one time it was supposed to have a module that tried to  
      generate an initial profile from a users email. 
     
    - planning to use stuff from research? 
     
    THE PROPOSAL 
    - We are putting together a proposal for getting expertise from email. 
      We are not to be doing packaged notes apps; and no particular  
      expertise in note UI design, but have something to offer in  
      the mining component. 
    - Unless we explicitly set out to develop something compatible with 
      your current design, it wont be compatible. 
      So who should I talk with? 
    - I am writing a FOAK proposal for funding this work. 
      Need an industry parter who would be in a position to eval the work. 
      I think your group is ideal for this. 
      would you be the person to talk with?  I should set up a visit. 
     
     
    QUESTIONS 
    - Who would I talk w. about possible partnership? 
    - Who can I ask about development details? 
    - [I need to find programmer] 
    - Any recent descriptions, screen cams, documentation, etc.? 
     
    DETAILS 
    - Does it use an enumerated list of expertise categories?

    ======= 
    Phone w. Bill Cody 
    - Ukleson mail discovery -> led to -> skill inference 
      Should be w. lotus for impact; should be from early on 
    - Impt. for us to adopt Yoda framework so 
      benefits obviously outweigh costs for group 
    - First goal:  Get ground level connection w. Yoda group 
     
    - I would like to have a day visit w. someone there. 
     
    - Longer term goal partner (an evaluator for the work)
