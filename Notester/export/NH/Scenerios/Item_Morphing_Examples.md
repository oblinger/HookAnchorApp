    ===================================================
    ===  Item can change attributes thru its life.  ===
    ===================================================

    - Idea comes up in discussions.  
    - I capture it as a scratch note.
    - First actions requires web search, so i move to the web list
    - Then move it to the calls list.
    - Idea becomes a multi-action: calls and a discussion item.  (it becomes a named list)
    - I get files to associate with the evolving idea (it becomes a sub-project somewhere)
    - I change where the project is stored on disk
    - I change the parent for the project which implicitly changes directory
    - I archive whole project 1-year after completion

    Actions:
    TAB-Q-Q   Create item on scratch list.
    TAB-T-N   Throw item onto 'Net' list.
    TAB-T-C   Throw item onto 'Call' list.   (should remember 'net' item) 
    ALT<<>>? "name"  Apply todo-list template, create todo-list 'name' under current 
    ALT-E-A-S Apply sub-project template.


    ==============================
    ===  Item list life cycle  ===
    ==============================

    - Item is created.
    - It is converted into a list
    - Items are added to that list
    - Added items are copied (thrown) onto different global lists
    - As Items are completed they are 'x' ed.
    - At some point the list itself is 'x' and then it is archived.
    - List is thrown
