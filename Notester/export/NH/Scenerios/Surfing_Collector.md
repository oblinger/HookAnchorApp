    Notester solution:
    - CONFIG:  Notester is set with a hoover directory in the favorites tree.
    - User creates a directory as subdirectory of this favorites hoover dir.
    - When notester next wakes it will check for new hoovers.  
    - When it finds new directory it will apply the correct creation template using the dir name as the template name
    - It will then move the contents of the directory to the newly created dir
