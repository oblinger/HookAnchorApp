    CHAPTER.  STRUCTURING YOUR BRAIN  --  Where do I put all this stuff?

    Structuring can be very powerful, structuring can be very painful.
    Organizing your knoweldge can save enormous amounts of time, 
    organizing can expect enormous amounts of time.  All of these statements are true, 
    in this chapter we discuss principles that achieve the greater parts of the benefits
    while avoiding the greater parts of the pitfalls.


    Trying to find logical places for all the info entered into Notester will
    tend to cause paralysis.  Info is not put into the tool simply because
    one does not have the time to figure out where that knowledge should go.

    A short term solution to this is the ability to enter a chunk of text with
    no organization  (see QUICK-QUICK Notes).  But this does not remove the task
    of organizing the info, it just postpones it to a more convenient point in time.

    Seeing the info relevant to a particular task organized around that task is 
    very powerful.  It clarifies what need to be done, it puts important info
    at your fingertips especially when the tasks activity stretches out over time.
    Without a good organization most of your time is wasted trying to remember and find
    things, and the chances that important things will be dropped is great.

    Here we present the principles for a middle road between fully organized 'clean'
    representation of your tasks, and the no organization approach of simply logging
    information (or not recording it at all).  These principles strive for
    the biggest bang for buck, where the bang is have what you need when you need it, and
    the buck is your time and mental energy spent in organizing.

    PRINCIPLES
    **********

    ENTER DATA EAGERLY, ORGANIZE IT LAZILY
    It is generally hard to track down data at a later, better to enter it while it is in front of you.
    At the same time it is relatively easy to assign or reassign that info later; more importantly
    it will often be clearer later when you go to use that info, how it should be organized.


    ONLY ORGANIZE TO THE DEGREE REQUIRED
    Here is a sequence of progressively greater levels of ornanization.  Notester has been designed 
    to facilitate transitioning info up this ladder as the requirments on that collection grows.
    - ZERO ORGANIZING.  This level is much more powerful than it first appears.  
      Sophisticated searching and recency can serve to retrieve info.
      If info will only be relevant for a short time.
    - BUCKET, STREAMING
    - BUCKET, SLAMMING   add to note *anywhere*
    - GROUPING
    - OUTLINING


    ORGANIZE FOR AN ACTIVITY
    Structure a buck or group of bucket when required for a specific task.


    ORGANIZE REDUNDANTLY
    Don't try too hard to have one org for some set of info.
