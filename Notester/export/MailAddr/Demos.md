                Multi-word: eg: rob; r farr;  farr rob

    - Should weight multiple occurances 
     
    ISSUES: 
      - NEED MULTI-WORD prefix query string: difficult to make auto-completing 
      - SIMPLE/FAST; Most frequent addresses should be fast & require low cog load 
        * Important to minmize computer/user "hand shaking" 
     
      - Repeatablility is an issue. 
        * System could remember association between minimal prefixes 
          and full addresses.
