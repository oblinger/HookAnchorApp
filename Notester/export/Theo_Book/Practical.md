    Balancing occams pressure to eliminate models where simpler models exist, is our practicality constraint, 
    which pushes to develop and adopt new models when important aspects of our world are not 
    addressed in a satisfactory way.  

    For example, one can explain all that is in quantum terms, but such a model does
    not address me as a separate entity existing over time, with aparent volition, etc.  
    Thus practicality dictates that we adopt some model that include a 'me' element which explains the 
    salient observable properties of the me element.  

    We recognize tht Practicality dictates adopting further frameowrks even if parsimony suggests that they are 
    unnecessary since all is explained at the physical level



    PRACTICALITY:  Belief in frameworks and existence within a framework driven by practical considerations:
     - does framework deal with aspects of world that are important to us?
     - does framework make interesting predictions and is internal consistent?
     - is framework supported by observation?
