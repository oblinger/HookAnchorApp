         === NonExclusiveModels, MultiLayered, Generative, 

    CONCLUSIONS
     - Must stamp hard on this half-belief that what is "really" happening is a this lowest physical level, and
       any other models are somehow less important, or less real.  The "real" stuff of our lives are never happening
       at this lowest level, and at a practical level they are more real to me than those at the base level.

     - Explaining a thing in one framework, in no way diminishes the reality of another framework.
       We must understant and accept/reject each framework on its own terms.  
       (Only if its *predictions* contradict other frameworks, so would we allow one frame to reduce belief in another.)

    Example:   (It is possible for all explanations below to be true, and it is not the case that the most
                real, or relevant explanation is the lowest model.)
     - Jim spent last night in Cell number #17 at the XXX correctional facility.   BECAUSE:
       Jim stole a neclace. BECAUSE OF:
       - a very complex chain of quantum states
       - a very complex chian of chemical reactions 
       - a very complex chain of neural firing, accross a dozen or so people, along with a 
         high level conceptual model of the physical world connecting these poeple.
       - because he was caught stealing
       - because he has weak morality
       - because of trauma in his childhood
       - because of a genetic predisposition
       - because of his upbringing, and peer experiences.
       - because his soul is lost, and he is far from God.
