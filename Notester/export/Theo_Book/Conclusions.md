    * have shown vindication and support for existing theological ideas.  
      we do not have support for a great many others.
      what perspective should we adopt with respect to those ideas?

      - recurring ideas within human thought should be viewed as either as the the experimental or theoretical physicist
        views the waxing poetic that the theorietical physicst engages in.  simply as
        interesting possibilities to be seriously entertained based on past successes of the theoretical physisct.

      - Less skeptically we can view these as potential models of the world to be accepted based in part on their beauty, 
        as well as their consistency and support from the world.

      If those perspectives are good enough for those on the leading edge of our scientific world view, they surely
      are not too promiscous for our views of theology.
