    LEAD OFF STORY

    A young boy dreaming of adventure, asks his teacher if there are magical creatures in the forest in the far distance.
    The teacher being a practical man answers accurately, "no there are no magical creatures there"
    Trusting the teacher, the boy dejectedly abandons thoughts of venturing forth, and is thus denied the pleasure of 
    seeing those beauties that he would have asked about, if only he had known enough to ask.

    Science is a bit like the practical-minded teacher who cannot see to the essence of the question we ask, and so instead interprets
    them the literal (and misguided) way that we ask them.  Like the teacher's respose above it is a technically accurate answer that misleads rather than informs.

    How does this happen?
    - Our everyday experience leads us to an intuitive and useful understanding about some tricky words like: exists, cause, etc.
    - And our cultural/religious expectations lead us to very concrete interpretations of God, living after death, creation, etc.
    - We can put these together into questions like, does god exist, did he create us, do we exist after death, etc. 
      and we mistakenly believe we are asking the important question.
    - Like the child in the story, we are either being imprecise, or we are not asking the question that we really wanted to ask.
    - Like the teacher, science will answer one precise characterization of the posed question, and never suggest that we might have been mislead.

    - Like the child we believe our questions are as plain as the nose on our faces, so we never doubt that they could be a source of trouble,
      and thus dejectedly abandon thoughts of venturing forth.
