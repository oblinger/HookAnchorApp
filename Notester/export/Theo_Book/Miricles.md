# Theo\_Book.Miricles --



    three kinds of miracles:
    (1) Very occasional actions occur at precise points in time
        that must occur at exactly that point in order to have
        the "good" effect that they do.  

        Indeed in some cases the whole universe narrowly avoids
        permenent deteration into a very undesirable state of non-chaotic non-rapid 
        gate changing.  These lockups are avoided by just the right set of gate changes
        at just the right time.  These gate changes seem to be consistent with the
        laws of physics, but there is no way to explain what such a complex set of
        gate changes *must* occur according to physics.  But they do, so there must
        be some explanation of these miracles outside the realm of physics.

    (2) Unbeknownst to the gates, there is a teenage girl "playing" this game of pac
        man.  The girl is manipulating four electrical contacts on the compass points
        of the games joystick.  Her goal of extending the games play is consistent
        with the gates notion of good (chaotic, rapid gate changes).  She runs from 
        monsters with they will kill her and toward the monsters when she can kill them.

        This miricle can only be seen by gates who have realize that a particular set
        of gates count the number of lives left in the universe before the bad state
        of non-chaotic non-rapid gate changing occurs.  They also realize a different
        set of gates contain a counter that is better to be lower (it is the number of 
        monsters on the screen), and a counter which is the distance to the nearest monster.
        Some of the time when the distance to the nearest monster becomes zero the life counter
        goes down (a bad thing), other times the monster counter goes down (a good thing).

        Some how the disntance counter seems to decrease during those period when it is a
        good thing, and in fact often increases when having a zero counter is a bad thing.
        Reductionists believe this is coincidence, but many gates feel in there gut that
        some force seems to be operating in the universe that is striving for good
        (chaotic rapid gate changes).

    (3) Power cycle as system Reset; chip replacement maintainace; and the flood of Noah.


    Ok, so there *can* be miracles in this world consistent with the mircles in religious
    texts, but that doesn't mean that there *have* been miricles like that.
