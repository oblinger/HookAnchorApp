    The Pac Man Universe
    - Many gates believe that certains states are preferable to others
      (certains rather rapid and chaotic change of electrical state)
      - Many gates think this definition of "good" is rather arbitrary






    ----
    Universe is more random and didn't have perfect start state like computer.
    Perhaps God "programmed" our universe the way our DNA programs us.  Shape of 
    DNA has nothing to do with our shape, and in the beginning belies little about
    what is to come, still we see that a rather specifically configure human
    is relaibley derived from that sequence.

    ----
    One people have goals but you rather arbitrarily gave gates the notion that 
    chaotic rapid gate changing was a "good" state, the opposite was evil.
    but gates in a computer dont have any thought like that, so the analogy fails.
    True the analogy does fail here.  but my goal was to understand how entities 
    could be situated in a universe that had a God, miracles, and external notions of good 
    and evil.  If we are reductionists who believe the we humans are simply programmed automata
    with programed and arbitrary notions of good and evil built in, we can certainly imagine
    more complex gates in a super version of a computer where each gate had arbitrarily 
    programmined notions of good and evil.  There interaction with their universe, and 
    there experience of miricals etc. would be exactly as described here.
