    SUPPORTING THE SPIITUAL WORLD ON THE EDGE OF OCCAM'S RAZOR
    - Ok so the notion of a spritual world does exist in the same way that a cup exists.  it is 
      a useful description at one level, but not at another level.  But is there a god
      in that world anything like the god in any world theology?

     
    --------
    Faith supported on the edge of occams razor?

    - Occams razor is a priciple that says one should always adopt the simplest
      explanation as the true explanation since it will be the most likely correct explanation. 

    - Serves us (and the gates) well in understanding the universe.  time and time again the
      most concise explanation turns out to have good explanatory powers.

    - Still certains complex effects (dealing for example with the universe's life counter) 
      don't seem to be explainable by the laws of physics indeed even discussing such a
      random particular set of gates seems to have no specific relevance according to physics
      yet is clearly important for the universe.

    - Thus occam's razor demands that the gates find some concise explanation that accounts
      for the importance of this
