# 09-Overfitting-God.Pre-note --

    Mark, 
     
    Several months ago you tried to codify my half-baked over fitting 
    argument about the existence of god.  This has motivated me to think 
    about the whole thing in classic Dan style--obsessive detail.  Still I 
    am rather happy with the outcome.  It took me the better part of two 
    days to put it into writing.  If I had the energy, I would reread it 
    and shorten it, but I don't so you will have to suffer.  Now if I can 
    only somehow patent this whole thing for IBM, I will be able to count 
    the effort as work!  ;-> 
     
    For some reason I thought it would be fun to send this on to your Dad, 
    and Sister as well.  I hope you (and they) don't mind.  -Dan
