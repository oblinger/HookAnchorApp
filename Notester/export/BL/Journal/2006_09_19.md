    Dear Dr. Oblinger, 

     

    Thank you for taking the time to talk to me today about the COTR position on the Bootstrap Learning program.  I hope we can work together on producing a significant advance machine learning.  After talking to you, I learned I was approved for $ 2M <<>> 3 years in AF 6.2 funding for my new Architectures for Cognitive Systems program, so I am looking for synergistic programs.  It is focused on novel HW for cognizance operations.  

     

    Please let me know if there are any future activities <<>> workshops in which we can participate.   My contact info:
