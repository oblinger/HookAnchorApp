    My current guess is that our user is
    (1) A sophisticated computer USER
    (2) Who is explicitly NOT a programmer
    (3) They have been trained on basic interaction 
        and capabilities of the system.  
        (hours but not months of training)
    (4) Their model of the student is that it is 
        "kind of like a human student" that can
        Only learning in these specifically enumerated ways.
    (5) They intimately familiar with the task to be taught,
        And with the context that the task comes from.
    (6) but that they have NOT carefully crafted a curricula 
        to teach the task, rather the "curricula" emerges from
        their own decomposition of the relevant material, the 
        random order they happen to remember bits of relevant material, 
        from the specifics of each situation the student-teacher pair 
        encounter, and from the the shortcomings the teacher observes 
        in the student.


    Number 6 (not formal curricula) is quite important in my opinion.  
    I can imagine applications that bend on many of the other points listed above.  But a system that is sensitive to a carefully orchestrated presentation of material will be too brittle to use in any practical application.


    This is bit of a confusing point, since we *will* be careful in our creation of the curricular structure.  But we will carefully build in just the sort of discontinuities and partial information that real mentors provide to there students.

    I believe the studies of formal instruction are of limited relevance here.  Any work that analyzes informal mentoring is much more relevant.
    Even if no such work exists, it is still my opinion that this is our use case.


    A second point that could result in confusion: early in the program we might stick to curricula that are much more formal and structured than what you will uncover in practice.  We will 'relax' toward these more practical alternatives.  


    How is that for a starting point?
