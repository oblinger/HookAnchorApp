    CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PAPER
    WAYS THE PAPER CAN BE APPROVED





    ----------------
    Editor:  The paper is of interest as it stands.  It provides an articulated comprehensive 
    framework for addressing the important problem of rule based refinement and validation.

    Work of sufficient maturity for presentation in an academic journal, however,
    should contain a significant analysis of the effectiveness of the approach taken.  Different 
    communities have differing standards for such work but this paper has none.

    In my opinion, this flaw should be corrected before this work is considered for publication.
    My only reservation in issuing this opinion is that the work might never be completed and 
    reported.  Nonetheless the community is not well served by interesting work that contains
    little validation.

    This paper is a contribution as it stands.  It is a well thought out approach to an important 
    problem.  But the researcher considering the use or extension of this line of work will have 
    to build upon it without any understanding of the effectiveness of the approach.

    Please note that some wordprocessing systems (e.g. Word) will
    include a document authors name in an author field for a file.
    This is important if you are going to upload an attachment from
    a wordprocessing system with your review. A word file when
    converted to PDF will have this author information.  Please make
    sure you do not include this information.  You can check a PDF
    upload to see if it is included by clicking on file, document
    properties, summary.  It is also possible to click on the little
    right pointing triangle above the page slider on the right of
    the document to get to document summary. The author field should
    be blank or clearly not the name or any information that could
    identify the reviewer.

    Thanks in advance for your assistance.
