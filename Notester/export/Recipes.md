    6 servings 
     
     
    6 tuna steaks, 6 to 8 ounces each 
    1/2 cup olive oil 
    2 tablespoons sherry-wine vinegar 
    2 tablespoons soy sauce 
    2 tablespoons rice vinegar

    1/4 teaspoon minced jalapeno 
    1 teaspoon sesame oil 
     
     
    Wash tuna steaks and pat dry. Place in a shallow, non-aluminum pan

    vinegar, minced shallot, garlic, cilantro, ginger, jalapeno and 
    sesame oil. Stir well. This soy-sherry vinaigrette can be used as
