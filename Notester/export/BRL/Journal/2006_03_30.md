    TYPES OF BAA PERFORMERS (How do I get stuff done?)


    (1) Blue Team -- Learning guys
        - Each team has some integration support people?

        - One team focuses on deep shared components ???  

    (2) Yellow Team -- Curriculum builders
        - Ladder component builders can build domain *specific* components

    (3) Red Team -- Testing guys
        - Good consensus guys
        - 1-2 people for low level integration  (cannot do the heavy lifting)
