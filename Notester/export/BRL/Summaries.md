    An artificial intelligence will arise the way human intelligence does:
      by boostrapping repeatedly off of other intelligences.

    Central to realizing this end is the intelligence's ability to 
    how to express new understandings as new representations

    Much of ML today focuses on ever more clever methods for specifying bias
    and more clever algorithms for taking advantantage of that bias to produce
    intelligent behavior.

    ----
    An intelligence in the real world, however, has no one to 'program' 
    such a bias.  It must learn intelligent behavior from its interaction 
    with an apathetic mother nature and its interaction with other agents
    equipped to exhibit intelligent behavior, but not equipped to program 
    others for such behavior.

    Such an intelligence's learning *is* biased by its interactions, but the
    representation of that bias is NOT dictated by representational expressivity, 
    or algorithmic/engineering convenince.  Rather the representation of that bias is 
    dictated by the shape of the clues left behind by an intelligent when they are
    exhibiting intelligence.  E.g. being biased by observing the execution of an
    intelligent agent.  Not a conveninet bias representation language at all, 
    but that is what we have to work with.

    So an agenda for building an artificial intelligence is:
    (1) Characterize the types of bias a learner has to work with in our world, 
    (2) Simplify or idealize these inputs in order to decompose the problem of
        obtaining and "cleaning" these inputs from the central task of learning from these
        disparate sources of bias
    (3) Define a domain independent "ladder-API" for specifying a boostrapped sequece of such
        source bias and test tasks.

    The problem of boostrapped learning has now been formalized.  We solve this problem by:
    (3) Defining a syntax for a general purpose problem solver (intelligent behavior generator)
    (4) Identify heuristics for learning the parts of that general syntax from the 
        idealized sources of bias provided above.
    (5) We constuct a domain-independent learning agent by realizing these idenified heuristics into
        a sequence of bootstrapped problem solvers.

    Bootstrapping New Problem Solving Representations from
    prior representations using from human-like instruction modalities.

    Many knowledge-based AI reasoning and learning techniques 
    are extremely sensitive to the precise representation of the 
    knowledge used to drive those processes.  If background
    knowledge is expressed appropriately and at the right 
    level of granularity the techniques work well, otherwise
    they often to not work at all.

    Humans are adept at overcoming many types of representational
    shifts, often without even being aware they are doing so.
    They are often explicitly taught these new representations by 
    a teacher that is already proficient with those representations.
    Such a teacher can synergistically employs several communication 
    modalities in order "lead" the student to these new effective representations.
    Example teaching modalities include: text-book materials, teaching by demonstration, 
    providing hands on experience, and criticing student solutions. 

    == PROGRAM GOAL ==
    Our goal is to build an "electronic student" that mirrors the 
    human ability to bootstrap new representions from a 
    curriculum opportunistically constructed from a fixed set of 
    human-like input modalities.  


    Approach:
    * Build task ladders that approximate a human training curriculum.  This input to the 
      "electronic student" expressed as a sequence of performance tasks matched with instructional material 
      (expressed as idealized verions of text-book knowledge, demonstrations, explanations, simulators for direct manipulation, etc.)

    * Researchers develop a coordinated set of broadly applicable 
      bootstrapping (learning) techniques for deriving new knowledge and 
      new representations from prior representations.

    * Each input modality (e.g. teaching by demonstration, hands on manipulation, or 
      text book learning) will require their own specialized learning methods.  
      Excitingly, a task-ladder with coordinated training materials expressed in
      in a combination of input modalities will enable a rich space of new algorithms.
      These new algorithms will drive enhances performance by relying on the 
      simultaneous constraints provided by these different modalities.
      (Imagine learning simultaneously from several teacher demonstrations, text describing 
       the solution, and teacher feedback on one's own performance)

    * Bootstrapping new representations will require the development of a 
      common syntax for specifying new problem solving representation 
      which is flexible enough for very broad coverage, yet is sufficiently 
      constrained to admit learning of these representaions.


    I can think of no more fun way to spend a day, than to discuss and debate
    how to best attack "big" AI problems like this one.  I invite you to come 
    to Chicago for a day brainstorming about how how this general direction of 
    work might be forged into a specific measurable research agenda.

    * This bootstrapping process is driven by a ladder of training material 
      and testing tasks, where the instructional material mirrors many of the
