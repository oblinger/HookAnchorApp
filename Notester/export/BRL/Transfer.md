    GOOD TRANSFER DOMAINS

    *  Teaching by non-programmers required
    *  End user (or end unit) specialization needed (thousands of varients)
    *  High flexiblity required

    (Calo add on?)


    * Specializing analysis software
    * Plug and play component programming



    GOOD TEST DOMAINS

    * Flesh out addresses from plain text input
      > Person, sysName, URL, paper
