    SUMMARY
       The goals is to develop a system for bootstrapped learning based on convergent knowledge sources
    in order to climb a ladder of pedagogically motivated learning tasks.  The objective
    is to develop a task independent collection of learning components that are capable of climbing any
    task ladder presented.


    CONVERGENT KNOWLEDGE SOURCES
       A set complementary knowledge sources are convergent if they are each different types of knowledge
    but can all be utilized in a some common learning task.  For example, given the task of controlling a
    nuclear power plant the following knowledge sources would be convergent:
    * A text book on emergency procedures
    * A schematic of the plant
    * Traces of control actions taken by plant engineers in response to actual emergency conditions
    * Access to a simulator of the nuclear plant
    * Raw sensor data logs from the plant in operation


    TASK LADDER
      A task ladder is a sequence of rungs where each rung contains a set of performance tasks, along
    with the convergent knowledge required to learn those performance tasks.  
    Task ladders are pedagogically motivated--they are specifically designed to facilitate bootstrapped learning
    of the tasks on each rung based both on the learning performed for the previous rung, combined with the 
    convergent knowledge provided on the this rung.

    The ordering of concepts and problems provided in and Math or Science class are clear examples of task ladders.  
    These course are designed so that the problems, and knowledge provided on each 'rung' (chapter) are organized so that
    they support learning on subsequent rungs (chapters).

    It should be noted that a true task ladder will introduce new representations and new concepts and new strategies on
    each rung of the ladder, thus tasks many steps apart on the ladder will be completely different tasks, with completely different 
    representations, different knowledge, and learning/reasoning strategies. 


    BOOTSTRAPPED LEARNING
       A bootstrapped learning/acquisition system is a collection of algorithms and techniques that are 
    collectively capable of learning and acquiring (outputting) *all* knowledge, biases, and inputs required
    as input to those systems.

    The transferred knowledge from one rung of the ladder to the next rung of the ladder is collectively 
    known as a facile representation.  A facile representation is simply all representations, all knowledge, all concepts, 
    all reasoning strategies, and all learning biases needed for a given task set.  Boot strapped learning
    can learn/acquire a facile representation for one rung in a task ladder based on the facile representations
    learned for previous rungs in the task ladder.

    As an example, a facile representation for the game of chess would include base representations for a game position,
    operator characterizing legal moves, strategies for selecting best moves, as well as features that could be used
    in learning rules to improve those base strategies for playing.


    GENERATIVE VERSUS DISCRIMINATIVE TECHNIQUES



    GOAL --  UNBOUNDED PROGRESSIVE LEARNING
      --  There is no principled limit on what a human can learn, there are only limits on the size of the leaps they can make


    LADDER  --  Learning from one rung is available (and required) for the learning performed on the next rung.


    COMPLEMTARITY  --  Synergistic use of technique and knowledge
      -  Generative vs. Discriminative
      -  Learning/Acquisition techniques can bootstrap each other better than they can bootstrap themselves.  (the overcome each others weaknesses)
      -  Likewise complementary sources of knowledge can fill holes better than more of the same K.
      -  TEST: Gaps in each K source *can only* be filled using K from other sources.
         - word sense ambiguity.  missing terms.  


    MULTIPLE LADDERS  --  Build system against one set of ladders.  Test against an additional hidden set of ladders.
      -  Want to bootstrapping itself, not learning in any particular domain.


    CONSCIOUS LEARNING  -- Learning where one can articulate what was learned.
    CONSCIOUS STRATEGY -- Execution where one can articulate the strategy steps executed and the conditions controlling that execution.

      The goal is to bootstrap conscious learning and conscious strategies.



    "RIGHT" REPRESENTATIONS FALACY








    BIG IDEAS
    TODAY: Learning=OptomizationTechnique, one-shot
    - CUMULATIVE/BOOTSTRAPPING:  Learning will be explosively different when it can bootstrap.
      - (All) inputs can come from learning's output.  Eating its own tail.
      - Situated/autonomous/meta learning.
      - Knowledge Acquisition
      
    - ML as knowledge acquisition  (instead of optimization)
    - The larger learning problem (situated learning; continuous learning; re-representation)

    THE TEST BED
    - must be a ladder of related learning tasks, that exists at many levels of representation/abstraction
    - ? text-based structure capture for reasoning.   
      SAT questions?  Translational-Model building?

    - Address the "larger" learning problem.
      - ML today is an optimization technique for a carefully designed learning task
      - Address the larger ML task 
      - Attack 



    - Adaptive representations.  Relational learning.
