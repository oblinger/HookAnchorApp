    Hi Dan,

    I just talked to Cynthia Matuszek, who's managing our part in Transfer Learning.

    They are building problem classes (and worked solutions) for TL based on physics problems sent to them by ETS.  Problems are of the type

    (1) A man standing on a 40 ft building drops a ball, what is the height of the ball after 2 seconds
    (2) A frictionless block is placed on an inclined plane...

    They have done the basic representation of around 50-60 of these problems so far, and she estimates that (cutting out all the overhead of communicating with NWU and ETS) the cost of representing one of these started out at about 5 person days and has now come down to around 3 person days per problem.  (it also took about .75 PM startup cost to represent the general concepts in the domain).  Representing the worked solution for a problem takes around 1.5 weeks.

    Let me know if you need any more info and good luck with Tony,

    nate
