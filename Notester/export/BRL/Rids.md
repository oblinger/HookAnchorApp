    Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Technology    Bootstrapped Learning (BL)

    The ability to make real-time tactical changes to fielded military systems is a central concern given the increasingly rapid shifts in tactics faced by today's military.  The introduction of instructable computing would permit non-programmers to reprogram hardware in real time in the field.  The BL program constitutes an effort to develop the core technology for such a class of field-trainable military computing systems.  The successful realization of Bootstrapped Learning technology will directly address the growing need for real-time tactical reprogramming of military hardware, and software systems.

    The Transfer Learning program is developing technologies that will enable a military system, either autonomous or assisting a human, to function in novel operational scenarios by adapting and applying what it has learned from training scenarios and previous operational experience.  A system would act effectively and appropriately in novel situations with little training.  In order to acquire, restructure, and apply task and domain knowledge in novel domains the program uses techniques such as learning by analogy, task chunking, deliberative techniques such as impasse analysis, and constructing modular, hierarchical, and dynamically composable knowledge representations.
