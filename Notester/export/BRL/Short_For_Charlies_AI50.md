    Today's Machine Learning focuses primarily on discovering predictive models of some data source of interest.
    Such learning attempt to illuminate aspects of the target data source that are unknown to the user of the ML
    technology.

    By contrast Bootstrapped Learning is focused on Machine Learning as a mechanism for
    transfering capabilities of from a human instructor to their electronic student.  Notice the shift of
    emphasis here.  The goals is not to glean any knowlege unknown to the human user, rather the focus here
    is to use ML as a mechanism for transferring that knowledge from human to machine, in much the way that 
    a human mentor transfers their understanding to their understudy.

    It aim of these efforts is a revolution in the way that humans interact with computers.
    We no longer program complex behaviors in our electronic collegues, instead we 'teach' them in ways
    we are already familiar--in exactly the ways we teach each other.

    Such technology, if successful, will have far reaching consequenes for ALL fielded computing systems.
    Today's software must be relatively general purpose, it is the only way a traditional software development cycle makes sense.
    In the future, each instance of each software collection will be unique.  Over time it will be adapted and 
    fundamentally altered to fit each installation site.

    Imagine situational assessment data collection tools that evolve nightly as each new report is generated for a given
    100 block region in Bagdad today.

    Imagine an automated administrative assistant that has learned thousands of rules about what read-ahead and background
    materials it should include for each calendrered meeting it has scheduled.

    Imagine an autonomous survellance vechicle that has learned what counts as "suspicious" and exactly how to respond
    on a case by case basis.

    Imagine a logistics management system that integrates upto the minute requirements <<>> supply information and have 
    learned all the tricks of their human counter parts in planning, anticipating, and out of the box thinking to solve 
    the hundreds of issues arising continuously in any complex campaign.

    IPTO's BL program will aspects of this focus on ML as instructable computing.
