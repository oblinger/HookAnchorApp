    **************************************************
    **  Techniques for improving five dysfunctions  **
    **************************************************

    TRUST
    - 30 minutes.  Personal histories.
    - 60 minutes.  Team effectiveness exercise.  Focus on one person at a time, 
                   all members report their strong point, and one area that should be changed
    - 4 hours.     Personality Profiles: Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator Tool (MBTI)
    - 360 degree feedback.  Do not link to any merit evalution
    - Experiential Team exercises.   (limited utility)
    - Leader must demonstration vulnerabilty first.  Must avoid punishing vulnerability 

    CONFLICT
    - Mining conflict.
    - Real time permission.  this is conflict and it is what we are supposed to be doing
    - Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI)
    - Leader must not protect members by interrupting conflict prematurely.
    - Leader must demonstrate effective use of conflict.

    COMMITMENT
    - Failures stem from need for:  Consensus, and Certainty
    - Better to make a wrong decision and change it later than to waffle.
    - Cascading Message.  At end of meeting team should explicitly reviews key decisions during meeting, and agreed action.
    - Deadlines.  Clear deadlines for decisions.  honor dates with discipline and rigidity.
    - Contingency and worst-case analysis.  Helps team reduce fears of wrong choice.
    - Low-Risk Exposure Therapy.  Practice decision making in low risk situations.  Force decison after substantial discussion but little research.
    - LEADER:  More than others, leader must be comfortable with prospect of making decisions that turns out wrong.

    ACCOUNTABILITY
    - Def:  willingness of team members to call peers on damaging behavior
    - Publication of goals and standards for team
    - Simple and regular progress reviews.  a little structure goes along way
    - Team rewards.  
    - LEADER:  allow team to serve as first/primary accountabilty.  leader must continue to serve as ultimate mechanism.

    RESULTS
    - Use short term more controllable measure (not ultimate measure like profitabilty)
    - Public declarations of results
    - Results-based rewards.  dont give bonus for 'trying hard'
    - LEADER: must be selfless and objective.  must only focus on results
