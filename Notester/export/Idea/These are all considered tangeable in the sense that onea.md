                                     A WORLD WITHOUT WAR 
     
    This work outlines a minimal set of constraints which preclude the 
    possiblity of war.  To be certain, the possiblity of physical 
    aggression will remain an inherent possiblity, we seek to both limit 
    and to fundamentally change the nature of such an act.  We believe 
    this proposal has both a compelling philosophical justification, and 
    practical realization.  Thus we consider We consider this edifice on a 
    number of different levels: first we present an idealization of the 
    edifice sought, we provide formal notion to make express important 
    ideas within the framework with precision.  In the third section we 
    consider how this idealization might be realized in a more practical 
    setting, and finally we consider practical and theoretical 
    ramification of the system. 
     
    <<>> 
    <<>>  A FRAMEWORK FOR SELF-DETERMINATION  <<>> 
    <<>> 
     
    Before presenting this edifice we enumerate the assumptions and objective 
    that underly the framework. 
     
    (1) SELF-DETERMINATION 
        The primary objective of this framework is maximize the degree of 
        determination each person has over every aspect of their life. 
        Our primary concern is the inconsistency in this single constraint, 
        one person's freedom can be another person's limitation. 
     
    (2) NON-ABIGUOUITY 
        We seek to ensure that two parties cannot have legitimate claims that 
        cannot be simultaneously realized--that is, two groups cannot have 
        rights to the same thing. 
     
    (3) MAXIMAL DIVERSITY 
        Recognizing the diversity of possible governing structures and possible 
        human conditions, we strive for a least constraining substrate upon  
        which the greatest number of alternatives can coexist. 
     
    (4) MINIMALITY 
        We seek a simplest system that achieves these three stated objectives.   
     
        Just as important as it is to describe the objectives of this framework 
        it is important to specify the limits on the scope of the framework. 
        Most importantly this framework should not be construed as a form of  
        goverment.  Rather it is an edifice upon which governing structure can 
        be build.  This distinciton is crucial.  There are many 
        properties of that one might desire in ones government that should 
        never be objective sought by this framework.  Each constraint placed 
        in this edifice limits the diversity of the governing structure that 
        can be placed upon the structure.  Thus the framework is composed of 
        a minimal set of constraints so as to preserve non-ambigiouity while 
        maximizing potential diversity.  This framework does not provide  
        life, liberty, nor the persuit of happyness, rather it provides the  
        substrate upon which differing realizations of those goals might be built. 
     
     
     
     
     
    This framework attempt to construct a least common denominator edifice  
    upon which individuals can construct a complete personalized form of  
    governance.   
     
     
    This framework seeks to emulate an idealized world where individuals 
    choose a planet with a single ruling government to live on,  
    and upon making this choice their fraction of the earth's resources  
    are conferred to their planet.  If the governments of two or more planets 
    choose to do so, they may trade, maintain a common currency, or even 
    honor intelliectual property rights across their borders.  On the other 
    hand each planet is an isolated domain of self rule, they may ignore 
    others they do not wish to interact with and ultimately retain complete  
    and secure control over their resources. 
     
    It is important to be clear, this is not a form of government, rather its 
    is a framework that allows individuals choose their form of governance, and 
    to permit many different forms of governanace coexist on a single planet 
    without as if they were governing securely isolated domains of self  
    determination. 
     
    Thus it aims is to provide the greatest fairness, diversity and security  
    for the least cost and constraint. 
     
    -------------- 
     
    The defining tennant of this approach to governance is the supremacy of 
    each human's right to determine their own society.  Governments have no 
    rights, resources or power beyond that which it is afforded by a population 
    of supporting humans.  Further these resources and  this power diminishes in  
    direct proportion to a governments loss of a supporting population. 
    Governments do not own or control the earth, each person does. 
     
    The idealized model of this governance model is that at some point in time 
    the tangable resources of the earth (e.g. Lang) is divided into equal parts  
    one part for each living person.  Groups of like-minded individuals collect 
    their resources and form a government to control them.  As their will dictates 
    each person may take their tangeable resources to a different group. 
    As much as possible each group should be free to live as if their resources 
    comprised all of the resources of an isolated planet with only those  
    people.  Descendents, in their turn, inherit the resources of their ancestors. 
     
    Since all tangable resources are owned by the people, War which seeks to  
    acquire those resources from a non-acquesing population amounts to theft. 
    Security against such theft is managed collectively by all peoples subject 
    to codified rules of fair play. 
     
    Non-divisible resources (e.g. clean air) cannot be owned by individuals or  
    governments thus they are managed collectively by all peoples subject to  
    codified rules of fair play.   
     
    Non-tangeable resources (e.g. intellectual property, trade agreements) are 
    not controlled or even recognized at this level of governance.  Laws and 
    agreements may be freely entered, honored, or broken, as determined by 
    the peoples involved.  Although global rules of behavior for non-tangeable 
    resources are imposed by this system, it does not preclude creation of 
    creation of bodies that do control non-tangeable resources.  By the rules  
    set out above however, these bodies cannot have any direct control over 
    tangeble or non-divisible resources which are controlled as described above.   
    Thus the coercive power and juristiction of such bodies are ultimately  
    determined by their ability to influence behavior of people. 
     
    As an example, five governments might form a controlling body and thru this 
    body agree to have no tarrifs on goods traded between themselves.  The body 
    might further decree a specific monetary fine for violators.  The bodies 
    ability to enforce payment of this fine ultimately rests on the  
    desire of those peoples as represented by their govenments to continue 
    to be controlled by this body.  No physical enforcement of the rules of the 
    body would be possible.  International credibilty in honoring past commitments 
    would be the only guarantees others have when securing future agreements with 
    any group.  The extreme importance of such honorable behavior become the  
    coercive force that ensures it. 
     
    This idealized form of governance has a great many practical considerations. 
    We attempt to address the largest of them in subsequent sections.  Before  
    moving on to this onerous task it is important to highlight what is to be 
    gained by the adoption of such a system of governance. 
     
    A primary and central gain is the elimination of war.  Now to be sure, 
    physical violence is a physical reality.  No set of rules can eliminate 
    that possiblity, but it changes the nature of that act.  Each 
    person gives control of themselves and control of their inaleinably 
    inherited resources to the government of their choice.  If another government 
    uses force to control those resources and those people it is theft, plain and  
    simple.  The agressor cannot justify their aggression by appealing to their  
    own security since this system secures their right to the resources 
    inherited by their population (much more on this later.)  Further they cannot 
    justify their action in service of the freedom of some "oppressed" peoples. 
    If those other peoples were themselves felt oppressed by their goverment, they 
    would simply emigrate to the agressors country taking their resources with 
    them.  A goverment that continues to support agression under these  
    circumstances is undeighably a thug or thief, attempting to take or control 
    what is not theirs. 
     
    A second central aim of this system of governance is to make self-determination 
    the bedrock upon which the necessarily constraining modern society is based. 
    The functioning of all modern societies is necessiarily based on a complex 
    set of constraints placed on the people goverened.  Powerful forces control 
    these constraints; in most cases, the individual has little power to  
    overcome them (try not paying into your social security account.) 
    New governments rooted in voluntary population support them would  
    behave in much the same way, but with two crucial differences.  First these 
    governments could never afford to allow any group to become so disinfranchised 
    that they are tempted to leave the country--they will, and they will take  
    their part of the country with them.  This forms an important safety valve 
    against oppression of one group over another within a country.  Second, 
    youthful enthusiasm for building a better life, a better way for a society 
    to be, will allways have an outlet.  Never again will an individual have 
    to accept a state of affairs simply because "that is the way it is." 
    Regardless of the structures they are born into they can always with sufficient 
    motivation, take their inalienable inheritance and attempt to create a  
    better society. 
     
    A bit of forecasting suggest this new found freedom will quickly yield  
    a history replete with a great poorly funded, poorly designed conglomerates 
    that were doomed to failure prior to inception.  Each individual would  
    explicitly tradeoff the security of the known with the freedom of the  
    unknown by their choice of country.  The immense diversity of cultures, and 
    the human imagination itself would fuel the creation of many countries. 
    Modern economies, on the other hand, reward large powerful alliances.  This 
    suggests that these countries would form looser federations.  Governments 
    and federations would grow and shrink in response to peoples support 
    and happyness with them. 
     
    Indeed if we look to other comsumer driven markets for evidence as to how this 
    might unfold, we can imagine a mature population that does not simply choose 
    one government that controls all of their resources and all of their lives. 
    Such a person might choose to live in one physical location and thus their 
    tangable inherited resources are pledged to that government.  They might, 
    then seperately choose a packages of social services, a seperate packages 
    of judicial laws, etc.  Arbitration of differing laws would be handled 
    much in the same way that arbitration of differing laws between different 
    states are handled today.  Obviously sufficiently different systems for  
    dress, for education, for buisness transactions, etc. could 
    not coexist in the same physical space.  Peoples demand for choice, however, 
    might push many governments to adopt very open policies which admit and 
    facilitate integration of quite disperate realizations of the same 
    governmental services.  Thus a newly formed goverment of likeminded  
    individual might borrow governmental services from a great many other sources. 
    Ultimately this complexity will be reigned in by the individual's patients  
    and attention.  At some level of detail each individual will award some group 
    the ability to make their choices for them by proxy.  My only point here 
    is that they may choose an over-arching government that then allows them 
    to make further selection of different proxies (sub-goverments) for different 
    aspects of their lives. 
     
    Such a world based on individual self determination would undoubtably 
    be more complex than a world of fixed or no choices.  Open ended freedom 
    to create new societies limited only by the human imagination.  would be 
    an unbearably complex place to live.  Fortunately human impatience would also 
    serve to limit the complexity of an individual's world.  All-in-one, 
    long-standing, conservative, stable, governments would hold an allure for 
    those that are happy to pay attention to their government as little as  
    possible.  Thus an array of choices of that vary in simplicity vs.  
    flexibility, and security vs. experimentation would be available. 
     
     
     
    IMPORTANT ISSUES AND FEATURES INHERENT IN THIS FORM OF GOVERNANCE 
     
    * The goal of this form of governance is to provide the least constraining  
      framework in which the greatest diversity of alternative societies  
      can coexist.  Thus the following three forms of governance are 
      preferred in the order listed: 
      - No governance. 
      - Governance thru selected proxy. 
      - Governance through collective management. 
     
    * The resources controlled by a government grow and shrink as the  
      supporting population emegrates to and from the country. 
     
    * The resources controlled by a government does not grow or shrink if 
      the net emigration is  resources controlled by an individual  
      is zero. 
     
    * Valuation of resources may change over time, but no country can gain 
      or loose resources as their valuation changes (their effective value 
      is determined when they were acquired) 
     
    * A Country with a net outflow of peoples must give up a proportionate 
      set of resources.  They may negotiate with potential buyers (governments 
      with net inflow of peoples) over the terms of the transaction. 
      (e.g. a region that contained a profitable city might count for 
       more resources if a buyer could be persuaded to agree.) 
     
    COLLECTIVE MANAGEMENT  
     
    * Collective management is limited to non-divisible, tangable resources. 
     
    * Collective management (CM) is to be limited as much as possible 
      since no individual can escape the decrees of such management. 
     
    * If a resource can be allocated on an individual-by-individual basis, 
      then it is divided an managed thru individual allegance to a government. 
      If a resource is intangible then individuals often by proxy of their 
      government manage these resources by created bodies. 
     
    * This leaves the following indivisible, tangeable resources to collectively 
      manage: 
      - The rules of the collective governance itself 
      - Collective resources like bio-diversity, and a clean environment. 
      - Security 
      (Note: these are all considered tangeable in the sense that one 
       group of people cannot simply ignore the existance of another group 
       and there by negate the impact of their behavior in these arenas.) 
     
    * Collective Mangement, "management collectively by all  
      peoples subject to codified rules of fair play," is handled by 
      a court system.  Each goverment appoints representatives to this  
      body according to the size of the population supporting them. 
      The rules governing these bodies are interpretations of a consistution 
      that defines role and scope of the governing body.  Changes to the  
      scope and role of the CM body require an overwhelming majority of support 
      across the world (perhaps > 9/10ths), a system of precident would govern 
      the interpretation of this very narrow, tightly-contrained mandate. 
     
    * The CM consitution would... 
      - bias in favor of limiting CM scope in favor of other forms of managment 
      - would place individual freedoms above collective managment even 
        on non-divisible, tageable resources upto the point that doing 
        so seriously threatened the planet or its population. 
     
     
     
    ISSUES 
     
    * Over time valuation of divisible resources may change. 
      E.g. The relative value of a parcel of desert land may change as irrigation 
      technology improves. 
     
    * A group should not gain or lose resources because their valuation changes. 
      Only resources being transferred should be subject to these 
      changing valuations. 
     
    * A higher relative birth rate within a group should not increase the  
      relative resources owned by that group.  If one group chooses to  
      have fewer children that group's descendants will naturally have a 
      greater share of the inherited planet.  "Spill over" from another planets 
      should not be able to erase this inheritance. 
     
    *  
     
     
    BENEFITS  
     
    * Physical oppression is precluded, both within a country and between countries 
     
    * I  
     
    * Many  
     
    DRAWBACKS 
     
    * Two wrongs cannot make right. 
    A physically powerful group cannot use tangable force to preclude or correct 
    an intangible injustice.  For example, one country cannot attack another  
    country in response to breaking an agreement, or ignoring intellectual  
    property rights.  Institutions could be created that use intangible force 
    to punish

    <<>> 
     
     
    The framework is critically dependant on precise notions of ownership 
    as a way of avoiding conflict based on conflicting beliefs about 
    owership.  To aid in this precision this section expresses the 
    framework described above using mathematical notational. 
     
     
    Variables:   
     
      R        -- The set of all resources 
      IR       -- Intangible resources 
      DR       -- Divisible resources 
      CR       -- Collective resource (public goods) 
     
      I        -- A measure of the divisible resources inherited by a group 
      P        -- The set of people in the universe controlled by this framework 
     
      FR       -- Fraction of all divisible resources allocated to an individual or 
                  group.  (A real number [0..1]) 
      FI       -- A fraction of all inheritance allocated to an individual 
                  or group.  (A real number [0..1]) 
      FP       -- The fraction of all peoples contained within a group 
     
      IPratio  -- Relative wealth per person for a group.  IP(x) == I(x)<<>>(x) 
                  (The weighted average IP ratio for any partitioning is 1.0) 
     
      A        -- An allegence partitioning.  It maps each person to the country 
                  for which they hold allegence. 
      Ai       -- The set of people in the ith country 
      A(p)     -- Maps a person, p, to the country. 
     
      MH       -- Migration history.  Each migration specifies: 
                   
     
    All variables may be subscripted to denote their value at a specific 
    time, they may also be subscripted with a time interval to denote their 
    change over that time interval. 
     
     
    Invarients: 
     
      Sum_i  FI(Ai) = 1 
      Sum_i  FR(Ai) = 1 
      Sum_i  FP(Ai) = 1

    <<>>  DIVISIBLE RESOURCE ARBITRATION  <<>> 
    <<>> 
     
    The objective of this arbitration is to ensure that individual receive their 
    inheritance, but reallocating that inheritance to the country of their  
    allegence.  This arbitration seeks to achieve full realization of their 
    inheritance that is it seeks to minimize the following difference for all countries. 
     
      FI(c) - FR(c) 
     
    NOMINAL TRADING VALUE 
    A divisible resource has a nominal trading value (NTV) which denotes the 
    value of the resource as expressed in FI units.  A model, M, of a resource's 
    worth is constructed based on attributes of the resource (hectars of 
    temperate land etc.)   
     
      NTV(r) = FI(c) * M(r)<<>>(R(c))   
      where r is a resource, c in the country owning the resource r, 
            R(c) is the set of divisible resource owned by c. 
     
     
     
    * BUYER PROTECTION. Countries w. surplus inheritance are protected since  
      they can wait for prices to drop sufficiently before buying. 
     
    * While waiting they can lease their surples FI to countries requiring 
      coveage of their deficit.  They can force arbitrarily high prices 
      since there is exactly as much supply as demand. 
     
    * SELLER PROTECTION.  Once a country has "covered its deficit" by 
      placing resources, r, whose NTV(r) is at least equal to its deficit 
      up for trade is is not liable for leasing fees. 
     
    ??? 
    * The seller is only compelled to accept an offer if the price for the 
      resource is twice NTV(r) for the resource  
      (and it does not lower value of remaining trading r) 
     
    ??? 
    * Hold back.  The seller is not responsible for leasing any resources 
      if the accumulated deficit is less than 100 percent-years

    ALLOCATION OF DIVISIBLE RESORUCES 
     
    Each country's available resources are defined as a change from their 
    previously owned resources updated by changes mandated by emigration 
    to and from the country.

    INCORPORATING EXTERNAL PEOPLES OR RESOURCES 
    1) PEOPLE.  Add them as memebers of accepting countries.  Do not update 
       FI or FR for those countries.  (May also be handled as an CR) 
    2) RESOURCES. 
       Added to the resources of the discovering country.  (May alos be handled 
       as a CR) 
    3) PEOPLE with RESORUCES 
       Adding peoples with associated resources is done by assigning them 
       inheritance and resources equalled to the nominal trading value of their 
       properties.  So FI(group)=FR(group)=NVT(group-resources) 
       This Inheritance may be divided equally amoung the individuals or it 
       may be allocated according to the ownership claims previously held 
       by each.  Once each individual has an assigned inheritance they  
       immigrate to an accepting existing newly created countries.
