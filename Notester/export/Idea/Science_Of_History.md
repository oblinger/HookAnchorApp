    GOAL:
      Magic box with no knobs that assessed the statistical support for any proposed 'pattern' in human behavor

    KEY ASPECTS:
    - PAST DATA:          use limits on model-space to assess probability of coincidence
    - FUTURE DATA:        model data coorelation to assess support for 
    - NON-STATIONARY:     use self calibrating model of non-stationarity to account for shifts in the world
    - ASSESS:             Individual Facts, Fact Sources, Intermediate Indicators

    - INPUTS:             Features, ModelSpaces (closed-form, simulation), Assertions

    * End to end assessment
    * Dont want to know what will happen
      - Want to know pdf of what could happen

    * If I believe XXX then sim will produce XXX
      - no knobs;  input ideas:  feature is relevant;  
        concept is relevant;  relation holds
      - fancy stats to compute evidence

    * Much coarser predictions

    * use data from very large history

    * Technology changes everything 
        (but people & their agendas do not)
      - separate human behavior from tech consequenes

    * Intermediate measurements
