    PROBLEM:  Spreading risk tends to cause entire community to be coorelated such that

    GALACTIC TRADING POST
    ---------------------

    Suppose n worlds have no way to communicate except thru a single trading post where
    energy can be stored & retrieved.

    In order to smooth out each of the n economies, the trading post agrees to provide energy
    back based on the local economy.  If an economy is hit by a recession, then energy is returned
    in abundance.  In strong growth, little energy is returned (so it must be produced).


    PRICE SETTING  --  For each commodity/equit item, I, in a local market, speculators bet 
    to set expected future price, F, at time, T, for I.

    The trading post now sells future energy, E, at time T, that will be released (or absorbed)
    in quantity Q where the market price of Q at time T is (F-A) for item I.  

    It is the trading post's policy to sell exactly one unit of inverse residual energy for 
    each using, I, that is being held by the local economy.  Speculators buy this inverse residual
    energy by buying energy and then giving that energy to the trading post.
