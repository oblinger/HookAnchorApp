# tell\_me\_about\_work\_social --



    XXXX


    I love what little I can see in your profile--we both have grad degrees! but it is so hard to judge common interests, so if you are interested in hearing more from me, please tell me a bit about you.
       tell me about your work and about your social life too -- what you do, and what you love to do!

    For me, my work has been all over:  I have taught at the university, done research at a research lab, work for the federal government, and now I am the co-founder of a online tech company.

    my social world is pretty small right now (working too hard :-)  but for most of my life I have had a pretty big circle of friends, and then a dozen or so best friends -- most of whom are now scattered around the world -- but we still stay in touch.  I love to be active, but I don't really like social that is focused on alcohol, 
    sports, or partying.  I love social groups where it is about the people you are with, and maybe an activity like a movie, or event.

    hoping to hear from you!
