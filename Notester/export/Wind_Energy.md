    =============================================
    Tether 
      Vectran HS
      Tensile 23g <<>> denier

      Lift ratio = 23 * 9,000<<>>12,500 ~~ 15x

      Denier = Mass in grams per 9,000 meters

      D.P.F = Total Denier <<>> Num Filiments

    Lightening Rope
      Cost $250
      600'  9mm
      3.5 lbs per 100 ft
      16,700 tensile strength

       .004 dollars per lift pound

       Or .4 dollars per KWH
       So Tether pays for itself @ 2cents<<>>KWH IN LESS THAN A WEEK?!

    Lightning Rope (second source)

    V12 3<<>>8"  Tensile 16800   Weight 2449 grams<<>>100ft

    ----------
    LENGTH
    Assuming 60 degree angle and 30,000 ft = 10,000 M
      length = 12,500 M   (3,4,5 triangle)
      length = 30,000 * 5<<>>4 = 37,500 feet 

    MEASURE

    Cost <<>> lb of pull =  Cost * 37,500<<>>Length <<>> Tensile
      cost in dollars
      length in feet
      tensile in lbs min breaking strength

    ENERGY
      <<>>

    1 KW<<>>HR = 3,600,000 joules  (one newton over one meter)   (newton = one kg one meter squared ??)

    ---
    Energy = weight * distance
    ----
    1 KWH = 2,655,220 foot-pounds

     50 mi<<>>hr = 264000 feet <<>> hr

    1KWH 2,655,220 = x * 264000     x=10 lbs 

    So at 100% conversion efficiency 10 lbs of force at 50 mi/hr will result in 1HWH

    Lets assume 10% efficiency for system, so 100 lbs per 1 KWH


    ------------
    COST OF GENERATORS

    comparison to hydroelectric generators:
     .6 cent per KWH  operating
     4  cent total  (most cost is building the dam)


    --------------------
    JET STREAM

    6 miles up.  
    typical summer speed 50mi/hr  winter 150mi/hr

    ------------
    COST OF PARACHUTES
    2,200 lbs cargo high velocity chute costs $345
    Assuming high velocity = 50mph or less then
    we get 22KWH for $345
    @2cents per KWH or 50 hrs per dollar = 120 weeks or about 2 years   (YUCK!)
    --
    COST OF CHUTE  (low cost Irvin aerospace cargo chute)
     500 lbs
     Descent 28ft/sec = 20 mi/hr
