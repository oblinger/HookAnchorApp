    SUBJ: SLEEP IN OPERATIONS (SIO)

    1.  THIS MESSAGE PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON MANAGING SLEEP TO SUSTAIN
    PERFORMANCE IN THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT.
    2.  SLEEP SUSTAINS PERFORMANCE, AND PERFORMANCE IS CRITICAL TO
    SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME ACROSS THE FULL SPECTRUM OF OPERATIONS.  LESS
    THAN ADEQUATE SLEEP WILL DEGRADE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND CAN
    LEAD TO ERRORS, ACCIDENTS, AND FRIENDLY FIRE INCIDENTS; IT
    CONTRIBUTES TO THE FOG OF WAR.
    3.  SEVEN TO 8 HOURS OF SLEEP IN EACH 24 HOURS WILL SUSTAIN
    PERFORMANCE INDEFINITELY.  SLEEP DOES NOT NEED TO BE TAKEN ALL AT
    ONE TIME BUT CAN BE DIVIDED INTO 2 OR MORE SLEEP PERIODS (INCLUDING
    NAPS) AS LONG AS THE TOTAL SLEEP IN 24 HOURS IS 7 HOURS OR GREATER.
    4.  NAPS ADD TO RECUPERATIVE SLEEP TIME.  A NAP BOOSTS BOTH
    IMMEDIATE AND LONGER TERM PERFORMANCE, WITH THE BENEFITS OF EVEN A
    SHORT NAP EVIDENT FOR UP TO 2 DAYS AFTER THE NAP.
    5.  PERFORMANCE WILL BE DEGRADED zWITH LESS THAN 7 HOURS OF SLEEP IN
    EACH 24 HOURS.  IF 4 TO 7 HOURS OF SLEEP ARE OBTAINED WITHIN EVERY
    24-HOUR PERIOD, PERFORMANCE WILL STABILIZE AT A LOWER LEVEL.  WITH
    LESS THAN 4 HOURS OF SLEEP IN EVERY 24 HOURS, PERFORMANCE WILL
    DEGRADE CONTINUOUSLY AND RAPIDLY OVER DAYS WITH NO STABILIZATION.
    6.  TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, SLEEP IN A QUIET, UNDISTURBED
    ENVIRONMENT AWAY FROM OTHER ACTIVITY AND PROTECTED FROM "WAKE UP 
    AND WAIT" INTRUSIONS.  SLEEP IN A NOISY, ACTIVE ENVIRONMENT WITH
    FREQUENT AWAKENINGS IS LESS RESTORATIVE.
    7.  WHEN WORKING ON LIMITED OR NO SLEEP, CAFFEINE IN DOSES OF 200 TO
    300 MILLIGRAMS (THE EQUIVALENT OF 2-3 CUPS OF COFFEE, OR 4-6
    CAFFEINATED COLAS) EVERY 3-4 HOURS WILL IMPROVE PERFORMANCE.
    8.  FOR SLEEP - LIKE FUEL, AMMUNITION, FOOD, AND WATER - TIMELY
    RESUPPLY IS NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE.  IT IS A
    COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE ADEQUATE RESTORATIVE SLEEP FOR ALL
    PERSONNEL.
    9.  THE KEY TO SUSTAINING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE IS ADEQUATE SLEEP.
    TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO SLEEP.  START NAPPING EARLY ON IN THE OPER-
    ATION, AND NAP OFTEN DURING THE OPERATION - "NAP EARLY, NAP OFTEN."
    EXPIRATION DATE CANNOT BE DETERMINED.
