    "Dan,

    Thanks for opening your brain to my questions.  Here is more fodder.  Look 
    forward to your reactions.  The p29-slaney.pdf is the more recent and 
    comprehensive of the two.

    "Dan,

    Thanks for opening your brain to my questions.  Here is more fodder.  Look 
    forward to your reactions.  The p29-slaney.pdf is the more recent and 
    comprehensive of the two.  See on p.33 of this report: 

    "An important feature of scale space is that the resulting analysis is
    a continuous function of the scale parameter, . Because the location
    of a local maximum in scale space is well behaved [2], we can
    start with a peak in the signal at the largest scale and trace it back
    to the exact point at zero scale where it originates. The range of
    scales over which the peak exists is a measure of how important
    this peak is to the signal."

    While I couldn't track down this reference, I'm attaching a paper that I 
    believe addresses this same issue and additional benefit focuses on discrete 
    signals.
