    >Ink jet; goes thru 200 new tools; predict failures 
    -populate help clustering  
     
     
    What do I really want to be doing in 5 years? 
    - in a startup.  why: $$ possibility, excitement 
    - technical lead for small group building prototype system

    DETAILS OF THE DIMENSIONS 
     
    HOME LIFE QUALITY --  
    HY:   NY is not friendly <<>> CA is laid back.  Demographics.  Weather. 
          Valley has Younger deek professionals like me. 
    IBM:  I am established in NY, and many w. energy are in the city.  
     
     
    WORK LIFE QUALITY -- 
    HP:  Working w. Nina, Mei, & Umesh would be great. 
         Academic & hacking collaborations would be productive and supportive. 
         Results would impact the company. 
    IBM: 
     
     
    ACADEMIC -- 
    HP:  Would collaborate on pubs; would be more connected to ML community. 
    IBM: More/better ML people across whole company.  Can  I work w. them?? 
     
     
    INDEPENDENCE -- 
    IBM: More researcher motivated direction.  Do I need it, will I use it? 
    HP:   
     
     
    BRIDGE BURNING -- 
    IBM: If I move it will be harder to move again or go back. 
     
     
    STARTUP -- better to be in the valley, but not that impt. ??? 
     
     
     
    HOW THE DIMENSIONS STACK UP 
     
    HP will be a good coddling environment: 
    - good projects; good collaborations 
     
     
    After 3yrs will I be in a better position to  
     
     
     
    SUMMARY 
     
    - HP has a great (& fun) group to work with. 
     
    - IBM has a solid academic tradition.  What can I parlay this into? 
     
     
    I am staying at IBM because: 
    - I can always switch later. 
    - Too many switches is bad & I don't know what I want. 
    - Eventually I will be able to do much independent work here. 
     
    I am going to HP because: 
    - life is short & I will enjoy working in their group today. 
    - better research & ML potential 
     
     
     
     
    LAUNDRY LIST: 
     
    @ IBM I have an office. 
     
    Prep for future:  
     
    A change now, sounds good. 
     
    At HP I will effortlessly be working on a steady stream of ML projects. 
     
     
     
    Best Path @ IBM: 
    - Research 2hr/day. 
    - Start contributing ML to other groups. 
    - Switch to ML group 
     
    still doesn't seem to meet nina's group. 
     
    Note: contributions to ML will not be valued in non-ML groups
