    CATALOG FOR PBG

    I am imagining a format something like what is show below.  Each entry has a ALL CAPS name so that when the list is 100+ entries long, one can glance at a section and remember the 10 issues in login w/o have to re-read each one.
    The title line for each entry is a summary of the issue.  In its body we might have a more complete PROBLEM section description of the problem (if needed), and later when we are getting ready to fix it, you or I would add text regarding exactly how to fix the issue.
