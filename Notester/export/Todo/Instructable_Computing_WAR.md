    Summary

    Moving from programmable computing to instructable computing
    DARPA researchers are developing computing systems that learn from natural human instruction.  This unique capability will allow systems to be quickly deployed and modified in the field greatly reducing both the time and cost needed to adapt to changing operational needs.  
    Significant progress has been made towards this capability, including the recent development of a language suitable for describing the complexities of interaction between a human teacher and a learning system.  An initial working prototype is planned for early 2008.
