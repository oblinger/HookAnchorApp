    Job Scope - How the degree of responsibility given to you relates to others in the same  
                band and job family. 
    Skills    - The skills you bring to the table and how you deploy those skills to help  
                IBM win in the marketplace. 
    Retention - A measure of the impact to IBM if  you were to leave and/or join a competitor.  
    Individual contribution -

    Discussion w. peter 11/00 
     
    Jacob might make $230 
    most  1st line mgrs make about $140K,  
    one in his (or jacob's??) group makes $168K 
    Top RSM range is $250 
     
    Distinguished engineers, fellows, and senior mgrs are salaried by 
    the RCM (Research ... Council ...) 
    - Bigger variable pay, more options 
     
    Determinations: 
    - Mid November: 
      - all pbc are printed, senior mgrs & Jacob meet 
      - people are grouped into 1,2,3 on board. 
      - discussions:  "one of these is not like the others" 
      - Second pass:  people are grouped by RSM rank 
      - discussions:  "one of these is not like the others" 
    - Numbers generated here are then pushed to VP, some changes may occur there. 
    - Early spring first line mgrs allocate a zero-sum pot of $$ for raises. 
    - Peter modifies (ignores??) theses numbers. 
    - They are passed up the tree.

    Job Band for RSM is like a 9 or 10 
     
    being a mgr = 1pt  
    writing a book is same. 
     
    Formal Accomplishments are big deals 
    Formal External Recognition is a big deal 
     
    Credit is assigned when 
     
    The team work section really still mean ``Impact for IBM'' 
     
    Salary is now uncoupled from rank number.
