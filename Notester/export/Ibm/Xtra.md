    * Productizing WMR requires that many details/bugs be cleaned up; thus some time on this 
     
     
     
    Currently investigating web-related document indexing (a potential direction for work within our group) through a number of avenues including: 
    Patent generation. 
    Exploratory meetings with Encyclopedia Britannica (an organization with document indexing needs). 
    On going discussions with the Bob Mack's information retrieval group here at Watson, and the Text-Mining group at Almaden. 
    Both the discussions with Encyclopedia Britannica, and the text-mining group have both yielded concrete proposals for collaborative work

    >>> Buisness Objectives 
     
     
    Watch-Me-Read (WMR) multiplies a teacher's ability to deliver individualized instruction. 
    My primary task for this period was to develop a companion tool that allows rapid  
    individualized analyisis of the student data gathered by WMR. 
     
    Primary task: Develop a visualization tool that allows rapid analyisis of student performance based on data automatically gathered by the Watch-Me-Read (WMR) application.  WMR multiplies a teacher's ability to deliver individualized instruction.  This companion tool extends WMR to allow rapid individualized analysis and assessment by an instructor.$$Support group's effort to productize WMR.  WMR's adoption in the classroom and its eventual product transfer both critically depend on resolution of many details.  (In my team results section I this contribution.)$$Explore directions for future work with in the education group.  Specifically, web indexing methods designed for student usage.$$Extend IBM's patent portfolio in automated web-based document classification. 
     
    >>> Results 
     
    Designed and implemented a sophisticated, highly-configurable, Java diagnostics application for analysis of student-reading-performance data.  Related sub-tasks:$Implemented a "classroom-centric" prototype of the diagnostics application.$Used this prototype as the basis for iterative refinment with reasearchers and teachers$from the Houston School District.$Through this collaborative design process we arrived at a word and student centeric tool.$Implemented the diagnostics tool.$Spent a week in Houston on initial testing and user feedback, a second testing session is planned for 11/30, with a final roll out to eight schools within the district in January.$$Assisted Peter with initial contact with Encylopedia Britannica and the filing of a related$patent "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" (in progress).$Expanded my prior contact with a group in Almaden working on web-indexing; invited them$into these discussions, and met independently with this group.$$Realized, through these discussions, that concept trees like EB's can serve as the basis$for a new type of constraint on web document classification.  In process of filing a seperate$patent, "Hierarchically-based determination of document scope." 
     
    Provided three types of support for the WMR application.1) Resolved specific incompatibilities, for example: Resolved a low-level driver incompatibility between certain PC video drivers and Watch-Me-Read.  Resolved a conflict between Watch-Me-Read and Kid Desk, a popular application used to launch Watch-Me-Read.2) Extended Watch-Me-Read's sprite-based animation module to allow multiple overlapping foreground objects to be updated over top a scrolling background image. (Extension is required for a reading-pace tutor where reading performance translates to progress in an on-screen race.)3) Met with members of our group and a number of organizations with the aim of productizing WMR.$$ 
     
    >>> PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES 
    Serve as a representative for the education group both in and out of research.$Leverage data mining background in service of other research groups within IBM.$Maintain active contact with the data mining community and forge new contact within IBM. 
     
    >>> RESULTS 
     
    Supported to the education group in several roles: 
    Hosted Mary Mark, a potential candidate for hire. 
    Provided demonstrations at the Industry Solutions Lab. and other locations. 
    Presented for students through Watson's Local Education Outreach Program. 
     
    Suggested a number of ways learning could be used to refine knowledge required by CLEVER, a web indexing algorithm developed at Almaden.  Collaborating with Soumen Chakrabarti on one of these; a learning algorithm that uses lexical cues to partition web pages into conceptually related segments.$Though limited by current time constraints, I have maintained contact with the Machine Learning community through:$Remained active and current in the field through roughly bimonthly discussions and paper readings with a small number data mining researchers outside IBM Research.$Attended the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD98) conference, and a series of related statistics workshops. 
     
     
    >>> TEAM RESULTS 
    Forged contact through discussions providing and receiving advice with members of Alan Marwick's, Chid Apte's,####, and Byron Dom's group.
