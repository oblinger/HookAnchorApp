Eli learned to play rough with his dog.  Epsilon is so strong, when excited he would knock Eli down, but Eli never cared   When he first learned to walk, 

Eli is 1/2 Chinese, and was born in the year of the Pig.  Maybe that is why he like piggies so much!

I like the way mommy tastes, but since I don't have any teeth I can't bite.

The first time Eli went picking pumpkins, He would not stop choosing more and more.
Each one was different, so he hand to hold them ALL.

Eli loves everything about Fire trucks and Fire men.

Here Eli found fire equipment while on a ship for fleet week.
He wanted mommy to take this photo of him, so we did!


Eli told mom to take his picture here

#### ORDERING & PURCHASING

  
Hooray!  The yearbooks look really nice, I just received the pre-prints in the mail today.
I want to execute the logistics of purchase and distribution in a way that minimized complexity for all involved.
For efficiency, I am just going to propose details here, but very happy for adjustments/improvements:

QUESTIONS:
- I am assuming you guys have a small table we can use for the yearbooks to sit on.  Correct?
- Do we allow cash, or REQUIRE Venmo?  Below I have a 'Cash' option.  I can manage both w/o much extra work, but someone @ BCMS would need to accept the sealed envelopes.
- How many copies of each classroom does BCMS want to buy?


== THE PLAN ==

PRICING -- At 15 copies per class, the pricing is about $18/book including shipping and everything.  That price is likely to go down by a buck or two once we get to full orders for each class.  So I think we can simply charge $20/book and tell folks this is close to the price of the books and any extra money will go to BCPO.  

DISPLAY — We setup a small table in the outer atrium at Big City with a copy of each of the three yearbooks on the table, and an “advertisement” page taped to the wall that explains how to order your copy.  
- Begin display on Monday Aug-8th
- I think people will naturally stand looking at the yearbook so having in the outer atrium is probably important to it does not block pickup/drop off.
- I am assuming folks will understand the can't TAKE the yearbooks, so we will rely on that expectation.
- The display will provide my Venmo address so folks can register for a copy, and there is a box of blank envelopes for cash payment.

VENMO PAYMENT - They simply Venmo $20 to @daniel-oblinger  with a comment containing their child's fullname and class:     CHILD FULL NAME  in Miss XXXX Class

CASH PAYMENT - They will write their name and class on the outside of the envelope:  "CHILD FULL NAME in Miss XXXX Class"     Seal $20 cash inside and give it to BCMS staff.
   (I could accept checks instead, but would go crazy if many folks used them!)

TOUCHUPS -  During the coming week people can touchup their photos:
- The printers intentionally clip the outer edges of the slides, so some of the slides need slight editing for all words to show properly.  
- The printer complained that some photos were lower than ideal resolution.  Folks can look at their photos and optionally upload better ones.
- Some folks want to change their copy or photos, they can make any changes they want.

DEADLINE - End of school on Monday Aug-15th.  At that time I will take the envelopes from BCMS and compile the list of books to be purchased into an online spreadsheet.

ORDER - I will place an order for the exact number of books that I have received orders for by the deadline.  

DISBURSEMENT - When they arrive, I will bring them to BCMS, and provide the spreadsheet of which student in which class gets them.  
- BCMS staff can place them into cubbies.
- Alternatively I can email parents telling them to come into to ask Emma for their copy (and be checked off the list at the same time.)



== ANNOUNCEMENT ==

Big City Parents:

The yearbooks are in and they look fantastic!  :-)  We have a pre-print of each yearbook sitting in the Atrium at Big City for you to look at.  We are selling them for the price of printing $20/yearbook, any left over monies will go to BCPO fund.  You can request a copy of a yearbook by Venmo-ing $20 to @daniel-oblinger.  Be sure to add a comment with your child's fullname and the class that they are in.  For example,  Eli Oblinger in Miss Soumya's class.  I will be finalizing our order on Monday, August 15th so be sure to get your payments in before that.

Also we can still edit the Google Sheets this week before the mass printing is done.
- You can check the spelling, text and photos on your pages.
- NOTICE:  The very edges of the photos are intentionally cut off by the printer to avoid white boarders on the pages.  Some pages should be editing to move text and key parts of photos away from the edges of the page.
- The printer also notice some photos are of a lower resolution than is ideal.  Just have a look, you can always swap them if you like.

Let me know if you have questions.  Happy to have our yearbooks!

Cheers,
Dan

### - Announcement

Parents,

We are putting together a yearbook for each classroom at Big City this year!  It will feature two pages for each family within the class as well as photos of the teachers and the school too.  This will be a great way to remember your little one's year at Big City, a great way to see & remember the names and faces of the children and parents within in your child's class, plus100% of the proceeds for this will go to the BCPO scholarship fund. Its a three-way-win!

Participation is entirely voluntary. Included below are links to an online yearbook where each family can add two pages of photos. These can be taken from your favorite family photos and can also be copied from photos you received in our weekly newsletter. (My favorite is a deer-in-the-headlights, wide-eyed Eli looking into the camera, right after Anaya put her arm around his shoulder.) Please do add photos to the yearbook regardless of whether you plan to buy one, and please buy one regardless of whether you chose to put family photos into it.

We plan to showcase these yearbook pages at the upcoming Gala next month, so please put a first draft photos in now, so everyone can put names to faces for your whole family at the Gala. Edits will remain open until just before we print the yearbook later this summer. Please join us in this fun celebration of the community we have all help build here at Big City.

Cheers!
Dan Oblinger (Dad of Eli in Miss Soumya's class)

  (This is their highest weight, it is like a nice magazine paper.)

Printing Center USA reviews
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/printingcenterusa/reviews)
- [Trust Pilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.printingcenterusa.com?utm_medium=trustbox&utm_source=List)

Here are my observations about 'print center USA' ... seems like they are solid quality for a very reasonable (almost but not quite) lowest price.  The main negative that I keep seeing is that if any thing is not quite right, they just cancel the order, and are not very helpful in resolving issues.  Still they have pretty strong overall numbers, so I am thinking we go with them.  We might want to pre-run our order with a smaller number, followed by the full order if all is well.  We are not time constrained, if needed we could switch and delay if there are issues we cannot fix.

Here is the full list of those whose pricing I looked at:
