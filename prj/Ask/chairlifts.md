> Please do some web searches for chair lifts and create a markdown document in the current folder called chair lifts each H2 heading in the document should list another major
 kind of chairlift, and then we can have excerpts and URL links to trusted sites that indicate which lifts are the best onesor that indicate a specific one is a high-quality
one. So for each major chairlift, we have two or three you are links with an excerpt underneath it that is someway recommending that particular model.


> Please add a markdown table at the top with all the models that you found a URL that points to the specific model itself and pricing information. If there's any other
attributes that are important, crosscutting attributes, add those to the table as well.


> Please look for the thinnest chairlifts on the market and let me know how thin they are. That is how far away from the wall do they sit?

> Please add these to the table and add that column to the table as well the width column
