## Project Status

This is an early-stage web project. The codebase currently contains only placeholder markdown files and no active web development files or configuration.

## Development Setup

When web development begins, common commands will likely include:
- Build commands (to be determined based on chosen framework)
- Development server commands
- Testing commands
- Linting commands

## Architecture Notes

- Testing strategy
- Deployment approach
