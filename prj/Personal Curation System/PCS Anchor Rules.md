# ANCHOR FOLDER

The most common stream types are streams of anchors.  Each anchor is usually associated with a folder.  Here are the aspects that may be associated with an anchor folder.

## Anchor Folder File Structure
- An ***`"anchor"`*** is a folder that contains a Markdown file with the same name as the folder.  This is the "anchor markdown" 
- So:   "`.../My Anchor Example Project/My Anchor Example Project.md`" is the folder's anchor markdown.
- The anchor markdown provides links to key parts of the anchor folder


## TLC Naming
- Commonly accessed anchors will have a short acronym for quick access.
- Ideally, these acronyms are three letters long, hence they are called TLC - Three Letter Codes.
- If an anchor folder has a TLC then its anchor markdown (with same name as folder)  should have  "(see [[TLC]])" as its contents
- Then the `TLC.md` will then be the anchor markdown for this anchor folder.
