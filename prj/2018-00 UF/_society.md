## ### FRAMING ###
### === PRINCIPLE ===
- **PRINCIPLE** -- An organizing idea or governing mechanism
- **MANDATES** -- The justifications that the principle should be followed.
- **BOUNDS** -- Natural limitations outside which the principle should not apply.
- **BASIS** -- The reasoning system which underlies the assertion of 'should' and 'should not' above.
	- **SELF EVIDENT** -- One basis is that a mandate or bound is self evident.  In this case people would generally agree to the mandate or bound when presented with it.
#### NOTES: SELF EVIDENT -- HOW CAN WE AGREE ON ANYTHING?
It seems no matter of policy is universally agreed across all peoples, thus it seems there are no things that are "self evident".  ANSWER:

Rarely do all people agree on a given _policy_, that is true.  But quite often they do agree on the correctness justifications for or against specific ideas.  It is how these different justifications _interact_ where much of the disagreement occurs.  

So one can make progress towards consenus governing mechanism by first expressing those antecedent justifications (those mandates and bounds) which are generally agree -- which are self evident.

Example:  Killing humans w/o sufficient cause is wrong.
There will be great disagreement over what constitutes "sufficient cause" still the mandate itself is generally agreed to be self evident.

And most would also agree that killing a human that is clearly and immenantly going to kill you.  Is self evidently excluded from the no-killing mandate above.

Again the interplay will cause great disagreement, but at least we can agree on some boundaries.

## ### SPIRAL 1 PRINCIPLES ###

### === FREEDOM ===
FREEDOM -- Unless precluded by some other consideration the default should be one of freedom -- the ability for any person to do any thing.

MANDATE -- Self Evident.

BOUND -- A limitation imposed by some other freedom of some other individual(s).

### === DIVERSITY ===
DIVERSITY -- Unless precluded by other consideration the default should be one of diversity -- a bias towards the greatest supportable range of options.

MANDATE -- Freedom.  Lack of diversity is a lack of freedom as it limits the choices that an individual might make.

## ### SPIRAL 2 ###
### === SOCIETY ===
**SOCIETY** -- A group of individuals non-coercively operating under some agree upon set of rules.

**FREEDOM MANDATE** -- The first and primary mandate for society is simply that without good reason otherwise people should be allowed to form societies.

**EFFICACY MANDATE** -- Societal coordination can have social, emotional, physical, and financial benefits, thus should be encouraged, or at least allowed.

**COERCION BOUND** -- A group cannot be a society if some of its members have no choice regarding membership.

**SYMMETRY BOUND** -- A society should not have policies which would cause it to conflict with other similar but distinct societies.

**BASIS** -- Self Evident

#### NOTE: SYMMETRY BOUND 

Example:  A society that had a policy that to ensure its future existence by being militarily stronger than all other societies would fail this symmetry bound.

Such a societal policy should be excluded since any society acheiving this aim would preclude other societies with a similar aim from acheiving their aim.


## ### SPIRAL 3 ###

### === NON-IMPERIALISTIC ===
**NON-IMPERIALISTIC** -- Societies should not seek to grow themselves realative to other societies.

FREEDOM MANDATE -- 

SYMMETRY MANDATE --

DIVERSITY MANDATE --


### === EXCHANGE OF VALUE ===
**EXCHANGE OF VALUE** -- A social-action (one involving multiple individuals) where each party willingly participates becuse they receive more value than the costs incurred as they assess both value and cost.

### --- TRANSACTIONAL EXCHANGE ---

### --- COLLECTIVE EXCHANGE ---

#### NOTES
As expressed collective exchange is quite regressive relative to most existing society policies.  Generally it would not result in a flat tax (a fix percent of income) but a FLAT AMOUT paid 

### --- SOCIETAL EXCHANGE ---
