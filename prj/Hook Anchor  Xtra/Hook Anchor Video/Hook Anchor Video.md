- [ ] check marks should be bigger and more visible (bold)
- [ ] The latest dist_.... files should be copied into the user's config folder so they can see and use the latest code in there config.js config.yaml or hook_anchor_zshrc file.  Those files should always be copied over so the user has ready access to them.


SETUP:
- Open Notes.txt in Text Edit
- Open Intro.txt in Cursor
- Use [OBS app](hook://OBSapp) 
- Rename fb-meta back and delete all fireball commands.



 Lead with the Problem (30 seconds)

If you're drowning in thousands of files across Obsidian, Google Drive, Notion, in dozens of apps both local and cloud - and tired of searching through folder hierarchies, trying to remember where things are - this tool solves that with a simple insight: you already have names in your head for all your important stuff, your personal knowledge manager should just use those!

Hook Anchor isn't another note-taking app. It's a meta-layer that works WITH Obsidian, Notion, Google Drive, bookmarks, PDFs - anywhere your knowledge lives.   

Think of it as a universal launcher for your personal knowledge, but one that uses the names in your head, NOT the names of your files!

It does this through a continuous two-way conversation between your digital memory and your meat memory.

Hook Anchor reinforces names already in your head, and is streamlined to capture the ever-changing ways you think about and name your personal knowledge.



Best to show this by example:

In my day job, we released a feature that adds a fireball effect to a basketball clip.

JUST TYPE - To find this, I just type the first word that comes to mind. "Fireball"

ADD FIREBALL - Not there, since this is for work, maybe we have a project page in Notion.  Yep, let's remember this! ...

ADD GDRIVE - After release we start using Gdrive for datafiles.  Let's remember this. (show my 'facets' list with 'Gdrive')

ADD LOCAL - Later, I needed to write up a contract related to fireballs.  I like using markdown in Obsidian for quick writing.
- USE TEMPLATE - A few well considered templates greatly simplifies creation, organization, and access.
	For local work files I put them under 'ww' using the CMD+OPT Q template

ADD ANCHOR - Notice that we are starting to get fireball items scattered around; we should anchor them somewhere.  Notion is the 80% anchor, but I do have gdrive files and local files too.  I could use my local fireball WW folder as the anchor, but this seems a bit gross for a project that is 90% online.  Lets just use the word "fireball" itself as the anchor.
- RENAME - Oh yeah, fireball is already used for the notion page and that mostly still is the anchor place for fireballs.  Lets rename it to be "Fireball Notion"
- ANCHOR - Use ">" to create
- RENAME GROUP -

ADD ALIAS - 
	- FI ALIAS -
	- RENAME FACEBOOK - 
	- 

MANY THINGS - Can link many kinds of things:
- haco /, haco cmd+T, haco enter
- bbc, @nick, free, ctop, resd, bugb, gmai, rock

REDUCE COG LOAD - Need not think about which app to use, how to get to it, what folder its in, or the current state of that app right now.
- The aim is stateless direct access.  Think of a name and you are there, For many apps this already works well, and I keep adding new apps.


FIREBALL - day job, just type
REMEMBER - notion, add
GDRIVE - Grab, Facets
ANCHOR - Contract, 
STREAM - QQ #Y 
ALIAS - fi, fb
MANY 
 haco /, cmd+T, enter
 bbc, @nick, free, ctop, 
 resd, bugb, gmai, rock

### Notes of GPT


  Position as: "A universal launcher for your personal knowledge - like Spotlight/Alfred, but it actually knows YOUR mental model"



Think of it as the missing 'instant access layer' for people who already have too many tools."


### Target

  Target Early Adopters Who Feel This Pain

  Perfect for:
  - People with 1000+ files scattered across multiple tools
  - Those who've tried and abandoned complex tagging systems
  - Knowledge workers juggling multiple projects
  - Anyone who spends too much time searching for that "thing from last month"

  For Beta Recruitment Post

  "Looking for 10 beta testers who:
  - Have 500+ documents/notes scattered across multiple apps
  - Currently waste time searching for things they KNOW they have
  - Are willing to spend 2 weeks teaching the system their personal naming patterns"

  The promise: "Stop searching, start accessing - using the names already in your head"


### Demo
  The Hook Demo (show, don't tell)

  Don't explain the theory. Instead, show:
  1. Type "q2" → instantly opens Q2 financial report in Excel
  2. Type "bbc" → opens BBC website positioned on second monitor
  3. Type "reveal" → jumps to specific chapter in your book manuscript
  4. "No folders, no tags, no searching - just type what comes to mind"
