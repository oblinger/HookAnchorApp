Here is the Hook-Anchor insight:   
I already have nicknames in my head for my important files, 
My knoweledge manager should be remembering MY names I shouldn't be remembering its names!

Think of this as a universal launcher for all of your personal knowledge across all tools, 
but one that uses names in your head not in your filesystem.


POPUP - The hook anchor interface looks alot like spotlight.

WORK PROJECT - Suppose I want to find the 'fireball' work project, the word in my head is "PROJ".  
- Here is the prefix menu for proj, work projects are usually in notion. so I type 'n' enter.
- My name for this is "fireball"  hit + and its remembered.

ADD GDRIVE - Later I am on Gdrive looking at a folder of fireballs highlight clips.  Lets remember this too.

CONTRACT - Later, I need to drave a v2 spec
- "PlayOnSports PRD"  I press CMD-OPT-Q to create local markdown file for drafting.

ADD ANCHOR - Stuff is getting spread out.  Lets unify with an Anchor: "fireball"  press '=' to define this as an anchor.

ADD ALIAS - fb

UNIFIES ALL - Folders, Contacts, Dashboards, App logins

SUPER Fast & Low cognitive load - using your names
EASY TO START - Seconds to update common names as you go



Adjusting your names on the fly keeps the crap out, 
and ensures fast effortless retrieval no matter where your info lives.



As you can see, adjusting names in hook anchor is lightning fast; 
It becomes second nature to ensure the first name to mind is always the right name 
And I think it is that immediacy that makes it a real joy to use.




 it becomes second nature to ensure the first thing you think of is exactly what is needed to






REDUCE COG LOAD - Need not think about which app to use, how to get to it, what folder its in, or the current state of that app right now.
- The aim is stateless direct access.  Think of a name and you are there, For many apps this already works well, and I keep adding new apps.


Notice that we are starting to get fireball items scattered around; we should anchor them somewhere.  Notion is the 80% anchor, but I do have gdrive files and local files too.  I could use my local fireball WW folder as the anchor, but this seems a bit gross for a project that is 90% online.  Lets just use the word "fireball" itself as the anchor.
- RENAME - Oh yeah, fireball is already used for the notion page and that mostly still is the anchor place for fireballs.  Lets rename it to be "Fireball Notion"
- ANCHOR - Use ">" to create
- RENAME GROUP -

ADD ALIAS - 
	- FI ALIAS 
	- FB ALIAS (RENAME FACEBOOK)

I'm looking at the code here and you're adding in something about page and document and file into the Rust code. Ideally, we have JavaScript code which does all of the specialized notion stuff and somehow returns a string that represents the location within notion for this thing, and that string is simply passed to the grabber regular expressions that decide if any suffix should get added. So why is there necessity to have specialized code in rust? And what is that code doing?
