 Lead with the Problem (30 seconds)

If you're drowning in thousands of files across Obsidian, Google Drive, Notion, in dozens of apps both local and cloud - and tired of searching through folder hierarchies, trying to remember where things are - this tool solves that with a simple insight: you already have names in your head for all your important stuff, let's just use those!

Hook Anchor isn't another note-taking app. It's a meta-layer that works WITH Obsidian, Notion, Google Drive, bookmarks, PDFs - anywhere your knowledge lives.   

Think of it as a universal launcher for your personal, but one that uses the names in your head, NOT the names in your file system!

It does this by maintaining a two-way conversation between your digital memory and your meat memory.

Hook Anchor's interface is organized to reinforce your meat-memory of currently used naming, and streamlined to capture your ever-changing ways of thinking about your personal knowledge without forcing file and folder changes.



Best to show this by example:

In my day job at SportsVisio, we released a feature that uses computer vision to track the ball and the player to generate video clips showing basketball shots with flames trailing after the ball--fun for sharing on social media.

- I know there is a notion page for this, should be under projects I think







evolving name changes as you are 


access an item this reinforces 


  Position as: "A universal launcher for your personal knowledge - like Spotlight/Alfred, but it actually knows YOUR mental model"



Think of it as the missing 'instant access layer' for people who already have too many tools."

  - Knowledge workers juggling multiple projects
  - Anyone who spends too much time searching for that "thing from last month"

  For Beta Recruitment Post

  "Looking for 10 beta testers who:
  - Have 500+ documents/notes scattered across multiple apps

### Demo
  The Hook Demo (show, don't tell)

  Don't explain the theory. Instead, show:
  1. Type "q2" → instantly opens Q2 financial report in Excel
  2. Type "bbc" → opens BBC website positioned on second monitor
  3. Type "reveal" → jumps to specific chapter in your book manuscript
  4. "No folders, no tags, no searching - just type what comes to mind"
