# 2025 Parent Fund Transfers

.[[2025 Parent Fund Tranfers]].

## Our Situation
- Parents in KY, children in CA
- Estate under $1M
- **No tax concerns** - can gift any amount tax-free

## Tax Summary

- Federal estate tax: $0 (threshold ~$13.6M, we're well under)
- Federal gift tax: $0 (same $13.6M lifetime exemption)
- KY inheritance tax: $0 (children are exempt)
- CA taxes: None (no estate, inheritance, or gift tax)

## The $19K Annual Exclusion - What It Really Means

- Under $19K/year per recipient: no paperwork
- Over $19K: must file Form 709, but still **$0 tax owed**
- This threshold is just about reporting, not taxation
- Parents can gift any amount up to ~$13.6M lifetime with no tax

## Reasons to Gift (Not Tax-Related)

- See children enjoy it while alive
- Avoid probate process
- Simplify affairs as they age
- Help children when they need it most
- **Medicaid planning**: gifts made 5+ years before applying don't count against eligibility (nursing home costs can be $10-15K/month)

## Key Consideration: Medicaid 5-Year Lookback

- If long-term care may be needed, gifts made within 5 years of applying for Medicaid create penalty periods
- Gifts made more than 5 years prior are protected
- Given parents' age (80s), this timing matters
