### Considerations


#### Platforms I am considering
- TeleHealth (Cigna?)
- Grow Therapy (Cigna?)
- BetterHelp (premium $200-$360/mo out of pocket)
- BrightSide (premium $200-$360/mo out of pocket)

  - Cigna copay pricing (likely $15-50 per session)
  - Specializes in depression/anxiety
  - Medication management included if needed
