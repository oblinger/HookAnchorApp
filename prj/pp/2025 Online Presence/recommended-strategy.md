# Recommended Strategy for Claude Code Content & Tools

## Core Approach: Tools-First, Content-Amplified

The tools are your differentiator. Content amplifies their reach.

## Phase 1: Tool Launch (Week 1)

### Preparation
1. **Polish your apps**
   - Clean, working code
   - Excellent README with:
     - Problem statement (why this exists)
     - Installation instructions (simple as possible)
     - Usage examples with code blocks
     - Screenshots or GIFs of it working
     - Link to demo video (record this!)
   - Add LICENSE file (MIT or similar)
   - Good commit history (shows active maintenance)

2. **Create demo videos**
   - 2-5 minutes each
   - Show real problem → your tool solves it
   - Screen recording with voiceover
   - Upload to YouTube with:
     - GitHub link in description
     - Timestamps for key features
     - #ClaudeCode in tags

### Launch Day Checklist
- [ ] Post repos to GitHub
- [ ] Submit PR to awesome-claude-code list
- [ ] Post demo video to YouTube
- [ ] Share on Reddit r/ClaudeAI ("I built a tool to...")
- [ ] Tweet with #ClaudeCode and tag @AnthropicAI
- [ ] Post to Claude Developers Discord

## Phase 2: Content Amplification (Weeks 2-4)

### Blog Posts (1-2 per week)
Write about:
- "Why I built [tool name]" - the problem space
- "How I use Claude Code effectively" - your workflow
- "Building [tool] with Claude Code" - meta content
- "5 Claude Code tips I learned" - quick value

### Where to Post
- Your own blog/Medium (SEO, ownership)
- DEV Community (developer audience)
- Cross-post to LinkedIn (professional network)

### Video Content
- Tool demos (already done)
- Workflow walkthroughs (longer, 10-15 min)
- Tips & tricks series (short, 3-5 min each)
- Real project builds with Claude Code

## Phase 3: Community Building (Ongoing)

### Engagement
- Respond to GitHub issues within 24 hours
- Welcome PRs, even small ones
- Join conversations on r/ClaudeAI
- Share others' Claude Code content (build relationships)
- Answer questions on Discord

### Cross-Promotion
- Link between your tools in READMEs
- Reference your tools in blog posts
- Show tools in action in videos
- Create tool "ecosystem" narrative

### Consistency Beats Volume
Better to post:
- 1 excellent blog post/week
- 1 quality video every 2 weeks
- Steady tool improvements

Than:
- 5 rushed posts/week that fade into noise

## Content Calendar Template

### Week 1: Launch
- Monday: GitHub repos live
- Tuesday: YouTube demos posted
- Wednesday: Reddit launch post
- Thursday: Twitter/X promotion
- Friday: Discord share

### Week 2-4: Amplify
- Week 2: "Why I built this" blog post
- Week 3: Workflow video + blog
- Week 4: Tips & tricks content

### Month 2+: Build
- Continue 1-2 posts/week
- Improve tools based on feedback
- Build second-generation tools
- Feature user testimonials

## Key Metrics to Track

### GitHub
- Stars (vanity metric but signals interest)
- Forks (people using/modifying)
- Issues opened (engagement)
- PRs submitted (community building)

### Content
- YouTube views & watch time
- Blog post views & read time
- Reddit upvotes & comments
- Twitter engagement

### Real Impact
- People mentioning your tools in their content
- Getting added to more awesome lists
- Tools cited in other projects
- Direct messages thanking you

## Realistic Goals

### Month 1
- 50-100 GitHub stars across tools
- 500-1000 YouTube views total
- 1000-2000 blog post views
- Added to awesome-claude-code list

### Month 3
- 200-500 GitHub stars
- 2000-5000 YouTube views
- 5000+ blog post views
- Regular engagement/questions

### Month 6
- 500-1000+ stars (if tools are good)
- 10k+ YouTube views
- 20k+ blog views
- Established as Claude Code expert

### Breakout Potential
If one tool or post goes viral (HN front page, trending):
- 5-10x all metrics overnight
- Sustained higher baseline after spike
- Media attention, conference talks, etc.

## What NOT to Do

### Avoid
- ❌ Buying stars/followers (damages credibility)
- ❌ Spamming multiple subreddits same day
- ❌ Posting tools that don't work well
- ❌ Neglecting to respond to issues
- ❌ Overpromising in marketing
- ❌ Being defensive about criticism

### Instead
- ✅ Let quality speak for itself
- ✅ Space out cross-posts by days/weeks
- ✅ Polish before posting
- ✅ Be responsive and grateful
- ✅ Be honest about limitations
- ✅ Accept feedback gracefully

## Your Unique Advantage

You have:
1. **Working tools** (most people just talk)
2. **Real usage experience** (authentic perspective)
3. **Multiple content formats** (tools + videos + blogs)
4. **Early timing** (Claude Code is new)

This combination is rare. Focus on quality and the engagement will follow.

## Next Steps

1. Review your tools - are they "launch ready"?
2. Script and record demo videos
3. Write excellent READMEs
4. Prepare launch week content
5. Execute Phase 1 launch plan
6. Iterate based on feedback

The tools will generate more sustained interest than content alone. Content amplifies tool discovery. Together, they create a flywheel effect.
