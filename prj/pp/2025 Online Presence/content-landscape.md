## Content Gaps (Opportunities)

### Under-represented Formats
- ✅ Video tutorials (very limited)
- ✅ Working tools/apps (few exist)
- ✅ Video + blog + tool combinations (almost none)
- ✅ Deep workflow demonstrations
- ✅ Real project walkthroughs

### Current Saturation Level
**LOW** - Perhaps 10-15 quality blog posts exist. This is a nascent space with room for many more content creators.

## Competitive Advantage
Most content is text-only explanations. Combining:
- Working tools people can download
- Video demonstrations of usage
- Written guides and best practices

...would significantly stand out in current landscape.
