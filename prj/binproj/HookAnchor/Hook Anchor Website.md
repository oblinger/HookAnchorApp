Hook Anchor adds a layer over your existing personal organization to address three key issues that plague these systems:
(1) Where to ***put*** your stuff without much thought
(2) How to quickly ***find*** your stuff without much thought
(3) How to keep it all ***up to date*** without much effort


80/20 NAMING
95% of the time, you are accessing the same 5% of your info over and over, but that 5% set gradually shifts over time.  Hook Anchor continuously adjusts its namings so the first name or acronym that comes to mind is always the right one.  The result is deliciously instant access 95% of the time.

LOCAL-ONLY ORGANIZATION
Taxonomies or tagging systems often start strong, but as they grow, they become crazy hard to manage.  The solution is to STOP organizing globally and start organizing locally by anchor, by time, and by stream.  Together, these methods facilitate quick finding in the 5% of cases where you don't instantly remember an item's name.



BY ANCHOR
You already organize your projects and topics using folders. Hook Anchor upgrades this habit in three ways:
- It allows those "folders" to span multiple applications/accounts, both online/offline into a single logical anchor.
- It dramatically reduces the tagging/linking required to guarantee finding items by clicking forward without backtracking.
- System to ensure each item has exactly one anchor as its home. 

BY TIME


BY STREAM



- BY TIME
- BY CHANNEL
- BY 


- Just deciding where to put some new item or project so you have any hope of finding it becomes painful.

The solution is to stop organizing globally by tree or tag and organize instead by time and stream.
- Like a trusty journal, you always know where to put the next bit of information; it goes on the next blank page, of course!

This system works well because it applies universally to all collected information, and often, we have a sense of the time period when each item was collected.

We can further simplify by having a couple of journals, each with its own "stream" of content.  But it is best to start with
We have to be very careful however to strongly limit the number of these "streams" because even small amounts of confusion about which stream a bit of information belongs in






The solution is to STOP using using taxonomes 

is to abandon any global organizational effort and instead organize things locally.
- Do this on the fly with little thought

Imagine an ideal personal organizational system.  What would it look like?

MULTI-TOOL, MULTI-LOCATION
First, it would span the full range of tools that you regularly use for work and home.  Its information would live wherever was most convenient; it would not impose structure on you; you would impose structure on it as you worked.

A great assistant would keep track of the few hundred files and locations you are currently accessing and would be able to find them based on YOUR naming of them without requiring YOU to remember where they filed it.  The ideal organizational system should


LOCALITY 


*MULTI*  — It give you access to your info wherever you wanted it to be using which ever tool you wanted to use.

NAMING -- It would learn and maintain names the names and acryonyms you have update to match names in YOUR head, rather than YOU needing to remember
