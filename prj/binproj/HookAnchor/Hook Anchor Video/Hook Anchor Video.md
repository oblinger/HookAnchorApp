 Lead with the Problem (30 seconds)

If you're drowning in thousands of files across Obsidian, Google Drive, Notion, in dozens of apps both local and cloud - and tired of searching through folder hierarchies, trying to remember where things are - this tool solves that with a simple insight: you already have names in your head for all your important stuff, your personal knowledge manager should just use those!

Hook Anchor isn't another note-taking app. It's a meta-layer that works WITH Obsidian, Notion, Google Drive, bookmarks, PDFs - anywhere your knowledge lives.   

Think of it as a universal launcher for your personal knowledge, but one that uses the names in your head, NOT the names of your files!

It does this through a continuous two-way conversation between your digital memory and your meat memory.

Hook Anchor reinforces names already in your head, and is streamlined to capture the ever-changing ways you think about and name your personal knowledge.




Best to show this by example:



FIREBALL - day job, just type
REMEMBER - notion, add
GDRIVE - Grab, Facets
ANCHOR - Contract, 
STREAM - QQ #Y 
ALIAS - fi, fb
MANY 
 haco /, cmd+T, enter
 bbc, @nick, free, ctop,

### Notes of GPT


  Position as: "A universal launcher for your personal knowledge - like Spotlight/Alfred, but it actually knows YOUR mental model"



Think of it as the missing 'instant access layer' for people who already have too many tools."


### Target

  Target Early Adopters Who Feel This Pain

  Perfect for:
  - People with 1000+ files scattered across multiple tools
  - Those who've tried and abandoned complex tagging systems
  - Knowledge workers juggling multiple projects
  - Anyone who spends too much time searching for that "thing from last month"

  For Beta Recruitment Post

  "Looking for 10 beta testers who:
  - Have 500+ documents/notes scattered across multiple apps
  - Currently waste time searching for things they KNOW they have
  - Are willing to spend 2 weeks teaching the system their personal naming patterns"

  The promise: "Stop searching, start accessing - using the names already in your head"


### Demo
  The Hook Demo (show, don't tell)

  Don't explain the theory. Instead, show:
  1. Type "q2" → instantly opens Q2 financial report in Excel
  2. Type "bbc" → opens BBC website positioned on second monitor
  3. Type "reveal" → jumps to specific chapter in your book manuscript
  4. "No folders, no tags, no searching - just type what comes to mind"
