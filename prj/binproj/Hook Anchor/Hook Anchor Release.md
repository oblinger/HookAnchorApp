**Proposed Forum Post:**

Hi everyone! I'm looking for 5 alpha testers for **HookAnchor**, a native macOS keyboard launcher designed for knowledge workers who manage both local and online information.

**What is HookAnchor?**

HookAnchor is a keyboard-first launcher that helps you instantly access:
- Local markdown files (Obsidian notes, documentation)
- Executables and scripts
- Web resources and cloud services
- Custom commands and workflows

Press Option+Space (configurable) from anywhere on your Mac, type a few characters, and launch what you need.

**Key Features:**
- **Fuses local + online knowledge** - Works seamlessly with both local files and cloud resources
- **Native macOS** - Built specifically for Mac with system-level integration
- **Auto-discovery** - Automatically scans and indexes your executables and markdown files
- **Keyboard-first** - Navigate entirely with keyboard shortcuts
- **Customizable actions** - JavaScript-based actions for complex workflows

**Who I'm Looking For:**
- macOS users
- People who work with local text/markdown files (Obsidian, plain text notes, documentation)
- Comfortable with alpha-quality software
- Willing to provide feedback

**See it in action:**
- Project page: https://oblinger.github.io/gitproj/HookAnchor/

If you're interested in testing, please reply or DM me. I'm limiting this to 5 testers for now to keep feedback manageable.

Thanks!
