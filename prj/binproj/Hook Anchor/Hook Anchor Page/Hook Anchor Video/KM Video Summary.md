[[Hook And Anchor System]] 


- First program I ever wrote was a game, the second was a knowledge manager.  over the years I have written MANY.  
- In the last decade I have settled on a core set of principles that I believe define best in class personal knowledge system
- And built hook & anchor as an example of these best in class properties.  Will list these properties and show them in practice with hook-anchor



*NAMING* (Hooks) — 
- You already have a PKM better than any possible software, it called your BRAIN.  It provides hundreds of thousands of items at your finger tips by just thinking of them.
- Many of those items even have a name that also comes to mind w/o effort too.
- PKM can store thousands or hundreds of thousands of items with names as well.
- The only problem is they are NOT THE SAME NAMES

=> KEY - is to mind meld your wetware naming and your digital naming
Two-way street - if you think of a name but it not your digital name -- make it BE your digital name.
When looking at and using groups of related names it reinforces namings you have chosen previously.
 ==> BEST IN CLASS PKM PROVIDES SUPER LOW FRICTION METHOD TO KEEP wetware names and software names in sync.


*MULTI* (Apps) — Certain tools are wildly better for certain kinds of knowledge.  Thus, the ideal PKM is a meta-tool that spans and unifies ***many tools***; it is focused on loading 
- IDE for code
- Notion for syncing w/ my team
- Trello board for team coordination
- Apple Reminders for personal todos
- Obsidian for local docs and project todos
- Excel for personal spreadsheet
- Google sheets for shared tables
- Apple Contacts to sync w/ phone.
- Firefox for personal gmails & personal gdocs; chrome for work email / docs
==> BEST IN CLASS PKM PROVIDES:   (a) the right knowledge into (b) the right tool with (c) the proper context at (d) the right time.



*GROUPING* (Anchors) — Organizing requires effort, and that effort becomes impractical as the scale of the task increases.  

- We can instantly comprehend and remember a "place" that organizes a few dozens of items, beyond that we loose the map
- The trick is to achieve global organization using a series of **small-scale**  **locally** organized places
- In hook-anchor these are called "anchors" - 



*FLOW*
- FEWEST KEYSTROKES, 
- LEAST COG, 
- LEAST RESISTANCE
(Incremental Editing; Streams) — Of course, we should wash hands for 20 seconds, read all terms before hitting 'accept', and scrupulously tag and reference each item in our PKM.  BUT WE WONT!  Thus, the ideal PKM weaves ***good organizational hygiene into the paths of least resistance*** you already follow in getting your work done.

- minimal key strokes
- minimal cog load 
	- local-only organization, 
	- using your names, not its names
	- standarization of action




DIRECT ACCESS 
Best in class PKM help you organize your places so many items have a known natural primary place (anchor)
- This is hard & cannot always work, but each time it does the benefits are enormous
DIRECT ACCESS (Aliases) - It is possible (and critical) to solve the lookup problem across these many independently organized localities ***without sequential searching***.




STANDARDIZATION - Templates & Streams
- logs
