# WORKFLOW
## Creation
- LONG NAME - is chosen for the new anchor with or without a date prefix and used to create a folder and index note.
- Use "#F", "#Y", or "#D" to create an anchor folder and note.

## Shortcut
- ABBR - Optionally, an abbreviation can be selected for the anchor; in this case, an ABBR.md is added to the folder.
-  A link (See [[ abbr ]]) is added to the index note, and the contents are copied into the ABBR note.
- Use "!" to create the ABBR file in the last command's folder

## Rename
- Rename LONG NAME, its folder, and its ABBR file to the new long name.

## Restructure
- Move the FOLDER under other anchor folders as needed

## Archive
- Rename the ABBR file back to the index file, or add a date prefix to all ABBR files

## Search
- ***??? FILTER ANCHORS*** - How to see all anchor files.  (click the Anchor flag)



# NOTES
## Invariants 
- FOLDER - Anchor's folder should use its long name, and can exist anywhere in the filesystem, locally or remotely.
- ABBR - Optional. Associates with the anchor's: (1) target item, (2) its folder, (3) its index markdown, and (4) its anchor menu.
- RETIREMENT - Once an ABBR is no longer needed, it can be renamed to add a prefix year or renamed to the full name of the anchor.

## Naming Rules
- LONG NAME - Each anchor gets a long name that lives on indefinitely 
- DATED - Long names should have a prefix year or full date if the project is time-limited.
- ABBR - Frequently accessed items can optionally have an abbreviation to reference them.
- DIRECT - ABBR can be associated with ANY relevant page or document.



## Goals
- LONG NAMES - Anchors should have a long name that can be used to refer to the item indefinitely.
- ABBR - Frequently accessed anchor or item will have an abbreviation (called ABBR here).
- DIRECT - ABBR can go directly to the most relevant page or document.
