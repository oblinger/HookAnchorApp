#### First Column

HOOK
Own your names!

While you have access to tens of thousands of docs, only a sliver of a percent are actively accessed over time, and that active set shifts slowly month to month.

Instead of wasting time and mental energy wading through these each time you access anything, you can spend just a few seconds per day ensuring your active hundred or thousand docs or folders have short, direct names.


#### Second Column


ANCHOR
Anchor your shit down!

Global taxonomies are impossible to maintain.  Organizing your docs by named anchors that logically span all of your content, regardless of app or location, on or offline, eases the burden of memorizing where each document is.  Limiting the number of anchors created per month ensures you can document, correctly link, and remember each anchor for years without effort.


#### Third Column

STREAM
Standardize by type!

Building repeated patterns and templates for common kinds of information simplifies capture and, more importantly, helps you know how to find them weeks or years later.  Expressing distinct kinds of knowledge as a templated stream allows targeted searching by name over a vastly reduced number of pages.  (e.g., a person I met 3-6 months ago, one of my work projects last year, a book I read 3 years ago are very narrow searches, but only if these are expressed as separated streams)
