## Hook

~~
Names you already know
IDEAS:  Like Spotlight, unique names, 0.01% of your content, anywhere online or off
Like spotlight but with unique names you already know for the top 0.1% of your content, and single level menus

99% of the time, you are accessing the same 0.01% of your content. "Hooking" content both online & offline across all apps allows faster access with ZERO hunting or remembering.  See how:

~~
99% of the time, you are accessing the same 0.01% of your content.  Seconds per day are enough to maintain <em>direct</em> "hook" names to this .01% wherever it lives.

~~
<!-- Don't waste time and mental energy wading through tens of thousands of files when accessing your active docs, instead spend seconds per day ensuring you have direct hook names for the hundreds you are actively accessing right now. -->
<!-- While you have access to tens of thousands of docs, only a sliver of a percent are actively accessed over time, and that active set shifts slowly month to month.
<br><br>
Instead of wasting time and mental energy wading through these each time you access anything, you can spend just a few seconds per day ensuring your active hundred or thousand docs or folders have short, direct names. -->
- Curated set of names directly linking key docs and folders


## Anchor

~~
IDEAS:  Logical grouping; on/off-line, all apps; Groups items; Deliberate anchor choice

Anchors organize content ***logically*** across online and off

~~
Global taxonomies are impossible to maintain. Organizing your docs by named anchors that logically span all of your content, regardless of app or location, on or offline, eases the burden of memorizing where each document is. Limiting the number of anchors created per month ensures you can document, correctly link, and remember each anchor for years without effort.

~~ 
Instead organize locally 

## Stream

 Building repeated patterns and templates for common kinds of information simplifies capture and, more importantly, helps you know how to find them weeks or years later. Expressing distinct kinds of knowledge as a templated stream allows targeted searching by name over a vastly reduced number of pages. (e.g., a person I met 3-6 months ago, one of my work projects last year, a book I read 3 years ago are very narrow searches, but only if these are expressed as separated streams)
