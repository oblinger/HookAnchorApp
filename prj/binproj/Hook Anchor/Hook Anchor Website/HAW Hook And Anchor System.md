# [[Hook Anchor Page Discussion]] 


# __
# Introduction

I have coded, then lived and suffered a dozen personal knowledge management systems (PKMs). Over the last decade, I have converged on what I see as the outline for an ideal PKM for the professional knowledge worker.  I believe an effective PKM will somehow embody these five pivotal insights:

*MULTI* — Certain tools are wildly better for certain kinds of knowledge.  Thus, the ideal PKM is a meta-tool that spans and unifies ***many tools***; it is focused on loading (a) the right knowledge into (b) the right tool with (c) the proper context at (d) the right time.

*NAMING* — People naturally organize their world using an evolving collection of *names*; the ideal PKM remembers the mapping from brain to PKM, so the user does not need to.

*LOCALITY* — Organizing requires effort, and that effort becomes impractical as the scale of the task increases.  The ideal PKM achieves global organization through a series of **small-scale, localized** organizational efforts.

DIRECT ACCESS - The ideal PKM solves the lookup problem across these many independently organized localities ***without sequential searching***.

*LEAST RESISTANCE* — Of course, we should wash our hands for 20 seconds, read all terms before hitting 'accept', and scrupulously tag and reference each item in our PKM.  BUT WE WONT!  Thus, the ideal PKM weaves ***good organizational hygiene into the paths of least resistance*** one already follows in getting work done.

This is critical to ensure the necessary organizational work gets done, and it also improves relevance since organizational efforts are always directed towards specific tasks of importance.



# The Hook And Anchor System
The Hook and Anchor System embodies these principles.  Without further ado, let's jump into it!

## HOOKSPACE 
*In a nutshell, this system ensures that anytime you think about an artifact, you instantly either know a hook name for it or you know where it can be found.*

**HOOK** — A ***hook*** is a unique word or phrase used to refer to some digital artifact.

Example hooks:   (Notice these require different tools and different specific setups)
- bbc		⟶ The website https://bbc.com viewed in Chrome on my second monitor, just like I like it.
- q2roll	⟶ The financial rollup report for 2025 Q2 stored on our team's shared G-drive
- reveal	⟶ An alias for the pivotal chapter in the book I am writing


The aim is to maintain a set of hook names for hundreds of frequently accessed digital artifacts, along with the tooling and context typically used with them.  We already remember hundreds of thousands of items and have natural names for many of them.  All that is left is to curate a subset of these, serving as an instantly remembered hook for hundreds of repeatedly accessed items.  Here is the basic workflow, along with a few tips for managing specific failure cases.


**LEAST RESISTANCE**
The key to least resistance is ensuring that, 
At the moment a user realizes there is a problem with the hooks is the ideal moment for them to make a targeted fix, since they already know exactly which app/document was desired.  The trick is reducing the edit frictions so low they 
a hook is wrong, one is in the best position to fix it with the least friction and mental effort.

*When to create a hook?* There are two natural moments: when first exposed to an artifact, you may already know it will be repeatedly accessed, so right then, you make a hook for it.  Second, right after you have searched and found an artifact that did not have a hook, you remembered.  Either way, you have the precise artifact loaded into its tool of choice for action.  All that remains is to name this situation for future reference.

*Choosing a hook name*.  Generally, this should be the first word, phrase, or acronym that comes to mind.

*But what if it conflicts with an existing name?* There are a couple of ways to go: 
  (a) Delete the old hook if it is no longer in regular use (you can still access it via its anchor).
  (b) Use a sub-menu or create a new anchor as described below.
  (c) Pick a different hook word/acronym if both hooks are active and another word one seems equally good. 

NOTE:  Be cautious about longer, multi-word hook phrases; they are slower to type, and easier to forget the exact phrasing.  I mostly use a single word or an acronym for frequently accessed items (see the Tips section for more).

**FRICTION**
Friction is the killer here.  At the moment, you see that your hooks are out of alignment, you're busy doing something, and it's probably mentally taxing.  Thus, hook updates must only take a couple of seconds, ideally without requiring you to leave the keyboard for the mouse or to leave the app where you are working.  Every decision, every keystroke should be viewed as a large burden that must be avoided.

**SUB-MENUS**


**FACETS**


**ALIASES**
Often, an artifact will have several natural hook phrases.  Usually, one can "nominate" a prominent one to use and remember that.  Occasionally, this will fail, and you will later think of a different hook name.  When this happens, it only takes a couple of seconds after finding the item to create an additional alias for it.  Aliases are "free"; use them to help with repeatedly accessed items.  A second use for aliases is as a shortcut for typing.  Below, you will see that anchors generally have longer, harder-to-remember names.  Creating a quick 2-4 letter acronym for content is a great way to access it during the few weeks when it is most actively being used.


Managing hookspace should be a day-by-day conversation with your PKM.  The goal is not to cover all cases, but rather to keep tabs on the top hundred or thousand artifacts that you are accessing now.  These ensure that 90% of the items you need are accessible in seconds, loaded into the right tool with the correct context information at hand, and with nearly no thought given to the process of getting it set up.


The system is built around a two-way conversation between you and your PKM, maintaining known hooks for your top items and effective anchor mappings for the rest.  The system requires discipline in its use, but crucially, it requires nearly zero effort per artifact and no global organization of anchors.


## ANCHORING

**ANCHOR** — An ***anchor*** is a digital "place" where artifacts are accessed and organized.

Example anchors:
- work	⟶  all


Anchors serve as a fallback for locating artifacts when no hook is remembered or exists.
The key is to ensure that the ***first*** anchor that comes to mind is a good starting point for finding an artifact.

This sounds absurd!  Most artifacts naturally associate with many anchors so how can we know which to look at first?!  You can do it

; this requires forethought and discipline to make this work.



**ANCHOR RULES**

Each user evolves a tiny set of 'anchor rules' they use to decide where artifacts should be stored within their PKM.  The key for these rules is that:
- They should change very rarely and only slowly over time.
- They are simple enough to be remembered and followed without much thought.
- They result in a single unambiguous and mostly unchanging anchor for each artifact.

This might sound like an impossible objective to achieve.  It's not, but it does require forethought and discipline in using them.  Additionally, we have several powerful organizational strategies to aid this task.

DOCUMENT SEARCH FALLBACK
Not all of the hundreds of thousands of artifacts that one is exposed to should be managed by the anchor-hook system, just your top 10,000.  The rest is found by performing content based searching.  (often filtered by time and/or by bucket)






Keeping this instant 


deals with dozens of new artifacts per days 

Getting this magic trick to work, requires a system and on going maintaince but it does NOT require much effort per artifact




container of artifacts along with a deterministic procedure for deciding which artifacts go into the bucket.

Each time you need some information, you use the hook that instantly comes to mind for it. If you don't remember a hook, then you look into the bucket where you know it was filed, and find it from there.  If you have ever tried to maintain a PKM, I expect these two sentences to sound entirely unrealistic!  Please read on...

You will only remember most acronyms for the days or weeks while you are using them, that is ok















The key to this two-way conversation is to update the hook words in your brain and in your PKM each time you access knowledge and notice a discrepancy.  95% of the time, I instinctively know the ideal hook to use each time I access my PKM. But if the knowlege is older or less used, I may need to select a more

Making this work for a few artifacts is trivial, but the typical knowledge worker is exposed to dozens of new artifacts every day.  Over the years, this number swells into the tens of thousands. Thus, the system cannot:
(a) Require much time or effort per artifact since there are so many, nor
(b) Require much up-front artifact organization, as it is rarely known in advance.

Instead, the system uses an ongoing two-way conversation between the worker and their PKM about these hooks and anchors:
- Frequently accessed artifacts need a short hook word to jump straight to them, but over time these words will decay and conflict.
- Less frequently accessed artifacts need to be anchored to a single known place, but the way we think about artifacts changes over time and by context, thus ensuring a consistent and instantly known mapping requires work.

Each knowledge worker needs to evolve their own set of hooks, anchors, and policies for how they are used.  You cannot get this correct from the start; rather, you will evolve your system over time.  Over the years, I have developed several approaches for managing these effectively; I will describe each in its own section below.  Over time, your version of the system will weave these together in ways that work for you:

FOOTNOTE:  For many years used Mac Spotlight search to drive this system, but recently I wrote a dedicated launcher for this system, and man it is sooo nice :-). The system is the same either way, it just lowers the frictions in using and maintaining the system.  See here for details about that tool.


# INTRODUCTION

I have coded, lived, and suffered with over a dozen personal knowledge management systems (PKMs). In the last five years, I have converged upon what I see as the outline for an ideal PKM.  Of course, any discussion about a "best" PKM must begin with agreement on what the goals of a PKM are. Here is my framing:  

A PKM is a ***system*** for ***managing*** one's ***personal*** ***knowledge*** where:
- ***Knowledge*** refers to *any* digital artifact of *any* type located *any*where.  This includes any document, container, executable, and semantically meaningful subparts of these artifacts.
- ***Personal*** refers to artifacts the user knows about and has interacted with.
- ***System*** refers to the behaviors, protocols, and software used to manage these artifacts effectively.  And
- ***Manage*** refers to any purposeful activity involving the artifacts. Centrally, this includes *retrieving* the artifacts into tools appropriate for the purposeful activity, along with relevant context for that activity.

Right away, we see that whatever such a system might be, it can never be covered by a single application or approach.  Instead, it has to be some universal methodology and a kind of launcher that provides proper context, knowledge, and tools, as needed for the activity at hand.  So, anchor-bucket pushes most knowledge work to specialized tools like Excel, GDrive, or Obsidian (where it belongs) and focuses solely on the meta problem of getting the right context, knowledge, and tool setup at the right time.

We made the task easier by limiting scope, now let's make it harder by adding desired properties:

**MASS SCALE** — Over a year or a decade, we might work with 10,000 to 100,000 artifacts, including key pages, documents on various servers, folders, apps, etc.  99.9% we wont ever need to see again.  But effortlessly having that 0.1% at one's fingertips exactly when required is the desired superpower.  

**FUTURE IS UNKNOWN** - However, we only have a vague idea which items are the ones that might be needed, and we definitely won't know how we will think about the knowledge space when we need it.  A priori cataloging based on our future thinking is impossible.

**NEARLY NO SEARCHING** — Yet the volume of artifacts is too large to allow for a lot of sequential searching. Somehow, we need to zoom directly to the area where the artifacts are, then perhaps do a bit of searching.

**NEARLY NO ORGANIZING EFFORT** — The volume is too high to support much per-artifact organizational effort.  At most, the user may decide where to put an item, which must be an instantly known deterministic choice.


### Here are some consequences of these observations:

- TAGS WONT SAVE YOU - 

- LEAST RESISTANCE - You will not deviate much from the path of least resistance on each interaction with your PKM. So, repeatedly executing that path needs to somehow converge on an effective system.

- CAN'T RE-ORGANIZE FOR THE FUTURE - 

- ON-THE-FLY ORGANIZATION - 
- Built upon the path of least resistance -
- After the fact organization
- Reliable, fast, easy access to all personal knowlege.
- Wherever it is.
- However, it was recorded.
- At mass scale.  e.g. 10,000 or 100,000 artifacts.










# CUTTING ROOM FLOOR

## KEY INSIGHT

You already 'know' about your personal knowledge at some level.  If you don't have some kind of ***mental hook*** for it, then it is not (or no longer) personal; it is just knowledge.  However, the way we think about our knowledge evolves over time and changes depending on our task, so the key is to maintain an ongoing two-way conversation with your PKM to keep alignment between the mental hooks in your brain and the content in your PKM.

Specifically, a two-way conversation to maintain:
- A vast and daily evolving space of *naming words, phrases, and acronyms* (**hooks**) and 
- A *deterministic* filing system into a slowly evolving set of organizational containers (**buckets**).

This conversation requires ongoing effort.  You recall the report you saw three months ago, but you don't remember the exact hook phrase you used at that time to refer to it.  And you know the huge Q2 effort it is related to, but you also know the specific topic area it ties to as well, so where might it be?
