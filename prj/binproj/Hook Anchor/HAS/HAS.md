STREAM - The idea is to group similar repeated kinds of content into a "stream" of items that are handled in some standardized way.  The trick with this is to identify these streams and then decide the details of how you will organize that kind of info.  Here are some of my streams and a partial explanation of my rules for each stream

| Book Summaries  | I have a large folder with a document per book.  Each file name looks like this:<br>2007 Getting Things Done - David Allen<br>(Multi-book anthologies are grouped in a single file by first read and series name) |     |
| Coding Projects |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     |
