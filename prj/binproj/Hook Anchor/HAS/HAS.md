 A personal information system should:
 - make it easy to capture what you learn today and
 - make it easy to find it days or years from now.


Over the decades and a dozen-plus system attempts, I have honed three principles I use to achieve this:

### STREAMS
The idea is to group similar repeated kinds of content into a "stream" of items that are handled in some standardized way.  The trick with this is to identify these streams and then decide the details of how you will organize that kind of info.  Here are some of my streams and a partial explanation of my rules for each stream

| Stream          | Rules                                                                                                                                                                                                             |     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Book Summaries  | I have a large folder with a document per book.  Each file name looks like this:<br>2007 Getting Things Done - David Allen<br>(Multi-book anthologies are grouped in a single file by first read and series name) |     |
| Coding Projects |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     |

Key is to make it easy to add content in the "right" in a way that still accommodates exception cases



### ANCHOR
Global organizational systems just suck.  They are hard do, they get worse as the scale, they take too much time, and are never up to date.  Screw all of it, go Local!  Group your content ***locally*** around a named anchors.  Now adding and finding content are broken into two easy steps:  (1) get the right anchor, (2) add/search within a small local anchor.


But my content is too mess to fit properly.


### HOOKS

Organize all info into streams including a stream of nebulous
