# Dataset Research Methods

## Search Engine Strategies

### Google Search Techniques
- Use specific file type operators: `filetype:csv sport statistics`
- Site-specific searches: `site:kaggle.com basketball dataset`
- Date range filtering for recent datasets
- Exact phrase matching with quotes: `"sports analytics dataset"`
- Exclude unwanted results: `basketball dataset -fantasy`

### Academic Search Engines
- Google Scholar for research datasets
- Microsoft Academic Search
- ArXiv for preprint datasets
- JSTOR for academic publications with data supplements
- ResearchGate for researcher-shared datasets

### Specialized Dataset Search Engines
- Dataset Search by Google
- DataCite for research data discovery
- Registry of Research Data Repositories (re3data.org)
- OpenAIRE for European research data
- Zenodo for scientific datasets

## Repository and Platform Mining

### Code Repositories
- GitHub: Search for repos with dataset files, APIs, scrapers
- GitLab: Alternative source for open source data projects
- Bitbucket: Less common but still valuable
- Search strategies: "dataset", "data", "scraper", "api-wrapper"

### Data Platforms
- Kaggle: Competitions and community datasets
- UCI Machine Learning Repository
- AWS Open Data Registry
- Google Cloud Public Datasets
- Microsoft Research Open Data
- Data.gov and international equivalents

### Community Platforms
- Reddit: r/datasets, r/DataIsBeautiful, sport-specific subreddits
- Stack Overflow: Questions often reference datasets
- Discord/Slack communities for data science
- Twitter: #OpenData hashtag and data science accounts

## Official Sources

### Government and Institutional
- National statistical offices
- Olympic committees and international sports federations
- University research departments
- Government open data portals by country/region

### Commercial Sources
- Sports leagues' official APIs and data downloads
- News organizations with data journalism departments
- Sports analytics companies' free tier offerings
- Betting companies' historical odds data

## Web Scraping and API Discovery

### API Discovery Methods
- Check robots.txt files of sports websites
- Browser developer tools to identify AJAX endpoints
- API directories: ProgrammableWeb, RapidAPI, APIList
- Documentation searches: "API documentation" + sport name

### Scraping Strategies
- Sports statistics websites
- Historical results archives
- Social media for real-time data
- News sites for event data

## Academic and Research Networks

### Research Paper Mining
- Look for "Data Availability" sections in papers
- Supplementary materials often contain datasets
- Contact paper authors directly
- Follow citation trails for original data sources

### Institutional Access
- University library databases
- Research collaboration networks
- Academic conference proceedings
- Thesis and dissertation repositories

## Social and Professional Networks

### Professional Networks
- LinkedIn sports analytics professionals
- Industry conferences and meetups
- Professional associations (SABR, etc.)
- Vendor partnerships and relationships

### Developer Communities
- Stack Overflow for technical dataset questions
- GitHub discussions and issues
- Programming language-specific forums
- Sports analytics Discord/Slack channels

## Systematic Discovery Methods

### Domain-Specific Approaches
- Start with major leagues and work down to minor leagues
- Follow international federations to national organizations
- Track from professional to amateur levels
- Explore historical archives and legacy systems

### Cross-Reference Strategies
- Use one dataset to find references to others
- Follow data provider partnerships
- Check dataset citations and references
- Look for "similar datasets" recommendations

### Temporal Strategies
- Search for historical archives first
- Look for real-time and streaming sources
- Check for seasonal data availability
- Monitor for newly released datasets

## Quality Assessment and Validation

### Initial Evaluation Criteria
- Data completeness and coverage periods
- Update frequency and timeliness
- Documentation quality and metadata
- Licensing and usage terms
- Data format and accessibility

### Verification Methods
- Cross-reference with known authoritative sources
- Check for data consistency and logical validity
- Verify sample sizes and statistical properties
- Assess missing data patterns

## Documentation and Tracking

### Research Documentation
- Maintain search query logs
- Track source evaluation results
- Document access methods and requirements
- Note data quality assessments

### Source Management
- Create systematic source categorization
- Track contact information for data providers
- Monitor source changes and updates
- Maintain backup access methods

## Advanced Techniques

### Automated Discovery
- RSS feeds from data providers
- GitHub notifications for new repositories
- Social media monitoring for dataset announcements
- Academic publication alerts

### Network Analysis
- Map relationships between data providers
- Identify key nodes in sports data ecosystem
- Track partnerships and data sharing agreements
- Follow researcher and analyst networks

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
- Review terms of service for data usage
- Understand copyright and licensing restrictions
- Consider privacy implications of personal data
- Respect rate limiting and access policies
