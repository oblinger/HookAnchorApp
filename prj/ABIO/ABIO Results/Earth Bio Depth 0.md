Here is a representative list of **biosynthetic depth (bdepth) = 0** molecules—i.e., **essential small molecules** that organisms must take in from the environment or that serve as the starting points for metabolic networks.

These vary slightly depending on the organism (e.g., *E. coli* vs. humans), but the core set includes:

---

### 🧪 **Carbon Sources**

* **Glucose**
* **Fructose**
* **Lactose**
* **Pyruvate**
* **Acetate**
* **Citrate**

> Organism-dependent; *E. coli* can use many of these interchangeably.

### 💧 **Water and Gases**

* **H₂O (Water)**
* **O₂ (Oxygen)** – for aerobic organisms
* **CO₂ (Carbon dioxide)**
* **N₂ (Nitrogen gas)** – for nitrogen-fixers

---

### ⚡️ **Inorganic Ions / Elements**

* **Na⁺** (Sodium)
* **K⁺** (Potassium)
* **Ca²⁺** (Calcium)
* **Mg²⁺** (Magnesium)
* **Cl⁻** (Chloride)
* **Fe²⁺ / Fe³⁺** (Iron)
* **PO₄³⁻** (Phosphate)
* **SO₄²⁻** (Sulfate)
* **NH₄⁺** (Ammonium)

---

### 🧬 **Simple Nitrogen and Sulfur Compounds**

* **NH₃ (Ammonia)**
* **H₂S (Hydrogen sulfide)**

---

### 🧱 **Essential Vitamins and Cofactors** (in organisms that **can't synthesize** them)

* **Riboflavin (Vitamin B₂)**
* **Thiamine (Vitamin B₁)**
* **Niacin (Vitamin B₃ / NAD⁺ precursor)**
* **Folic acid**
* **Biotin**
* **Pantothenic acid (Coenzyme A precursor)**
* **Vitamin B₆ (Pyridoxal phosphate precursor)**

---

### 🎯 Notes

* This is the **seed set** from which all other molecules in the metabolic network are synthesized.
* In **flux balance analysis (FBA)** or **metabolic scope analysis**, these are typically the "input" or **source nodes**.
* The **exact set** for bdepth = 0 depends on which molecules are considered “importable” in your metabolic model.
