**Goal**:  Build templated test problems.

TEMPLATED GENERATORS:
- TEST: Sequence of test problems, each with an objective and laboratory
	- OBJECTIVE - Measurable outcome, success threshold, defined setup, with natural language description.
	- LABORATORY - Repeatable MCP protocol with
		- EQUIPMENT - Mass Spectrometer, Scalar Measurements (temperature, pressure, ph level, light level)
		- MATERIAL - Substrates, Strains, Compounds
- WORLD
	- ORGANISM - One or more behaviors and some distractors
	- BEHAVIOR - Homeostasis, Control, Sense/Act, Sense/Act Pair
	- PROCESSES - Anabolic, Catabolic, Metabolic
	- CHEMISTRY
	- BIOMOLECULES
	- ATOMS

### 2025-05-13  KEGG Loader Instructions

yes, please provide a caching wrapper that I can re-run to retry. formulate it as a module with a main that I can run from command line to loads all required data printing basic progress. re-running should restart from where it left off.

Update Instructions:  
Please use these updated classes to produce the BioMolecule/BioReaction DAG from local KEGG data, then scan that DAG to fill in bdepth and energy terms for molecules and reactions.  The idea is to produce a huge DAG over all KEGG data.
Please output code as a single module file

please use these updated classes in order to produce the BioMolecule/BioReaction DAG from local KEGG data, then scan that DAG to fill in bdepth and energy terms for molecules and reactions.  The idea is to produce a very large DAG over all KEGG data.

### 2025-05-13  KEGG Generation

Produce the Python code that we can use to parse the KEGG database into a DAG of BioMolecule and BioReaction classes, as shown below.  The write a function that traverses this DAG to fill in the bdepth of all BioMolecules.  Together we will download the data and run this code.

```Python

class BioMolecule(BaseModel):  
    english_name: str  
    chemical_name: str  
    bdepth: int  
    produced_by: List['BioReaction']  
    consumed_by: List['BioReaction']  
  
  
"""BDEPTH  
  
Biosynthetic Depth (bdepth) is a measure of the complexity of a biomolecule as measured  
by its shortest construction pathway from the organism's bio inputs.  
  
- All bio inputs have a bdepth of 0.  These include: Essential Nutrients, Conditional  
  Nutrients, Exogenous Compounds (signaling molecules, exenobiotics, food bioactives,  microbial/external metabolites, opportunistic molecular cues)- Each BioReaction has a bdepth that is 1 greater than the max bdepth of all of its   
  reactants.  
- The bdepth for all non-input BioMolecules is minimum bdepth of all BioReactions  
  that produce this BioMolecule."""  
  

class BioReaction(BaseModel):  
    """A chemical reaction is a process that  
        - consumes molecular input 'reactants' in order to        - produce the resultant molecular output 'products'.        - If multiple instances of a reactant or product are used/produced they are simply          listed repeatedly in the reactant / product lists.        - 'activation_energy' indicates the energy required to trigger the reaction        - 'net_energy' indicates the net energy produce or consumed by the reaction        - 'effectors' are not consumed in the reaction but affect its reaction rate.lower required activation energy          These include: Catalysts, Enzymes, Co-Enzymes a kind of Co-Factor,          Activators, Inhibitors, Alosteric Effectors, Co-Factors, Co-Enzyme,        - 'reaction_name' is the name typically used to refer to the reaction.        - Reactions that do not have an energy_source are typically exergonic while          those with a source are energonic.

**Goal**:  build hard-structured behavior generators using gen-AI
**Example**:  Energy pathway generators.

#### BDEPTH

yes lets define biosynthetic depth (bdepth) recursively. Essential nutrients, small molecules, etc. have a bdepth of 0. Derived molecules have a depth 1 greater than the max bdepth of all inputs for the reaction that gives it the smallest possible depth.

#### Molecular Generators

#### Anabolic Generators

- Pick one primary reactant
- 0, 1, or occasionally more other reactants
