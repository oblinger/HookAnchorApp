### Ideas from Joe on management

personal growth

-- Approach.  Say ``I want keep this moving, if I have a soltion that is not busted, I'd to move with,
   but if there are show stoppers, then let hit those now.

-- <1min talk

-- Acknowlege w/o saying BUT



-- Come into a meeting with a strawman.  
   Make it clear you are not arguing for it.  Rather just offering it as a strating point.

-- Have discussions w. expressed intent to DISCUSS but NOT to DECIDE
   -- then later describe decision (you can explain it might not account for all ideas, but seems best for now)
