09-19 Ish           3:10-....    no push no email
                    just no info from him until quite a bit later
                    said he did not know how to connect via 
                    skype?!   then did not know github.
                    we have no commit history, nor any solid end time

                    >> I started at 6 p.m. on Friday the 18th and stopped work at 7 a.m. although I did have an hour power nap  around 3 or 4.
                       Otherwise I was pretty much pushing through this task. Oh it was enjoyable by the way... Now I know a lot more about developing in a Ruby environment and git than I previously did.

# BPSOX stuff


#1 — EMAIL RESPONSES — your response to the emails.  just respond exactly as you would respond under these circumstances.  this is a time critical situation, and your a busy person, so you are not going to be consulting a thesaurus.  None the less you are now the lead partner at Acme Inc who is leading this engagement, so you have to be professional,  competent, and clear in your responses.

Send us your responses as a single text document before doing any other work.  (you can make a copy of our email document and simply respond inline.)

#1b — ADDITIIONAL COMMUNICATIONS — any other messages that you will be sending out in the first day

#2 — your game plan.
Break out your approach over the first day.
break out your approach over the first week
and over the first month.

Explain what you are spending your time on
Explain what others are spending their time on
(I think this is broken out by 3 hours blocks of time or such)

#3 TRELLO BORD —  TEAM ROLES — TEAM MEETINGS — Once the immdiate crush is over and you are able to start
planning activities for the team create trello board and explain how you will organize your interactions with the team.  and expain the roles you are assigning, and any other things you need etc.

#3 The CEO asks you to write a proposal to PBSOX to a replacement system.
     PBSOX is growing by 15% month over month, and has just raise a significant round
     so the CEO was us to get in a solid position of providing even more value to them.

— provide an SOW   (maybe they only fill out one section in complete detail, and only over view other sections
— provide a vision of growing the base interaction with the company towards a larger role and value for PBSOX
— provide 2-3 slide over view that you will pitch to their CEO
     (we could provide hints by telling them what our company is good at, so it constrains the problem , but maybe super open ended is best.  let see what they can create.
