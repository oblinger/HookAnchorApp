Then make them uncomfortable. The other side of that coin is that you want to learn how candidates react when they’re not excited, too.
 Ask them about difficult experiences, or moments when they were somehow not in control. Some of Curtis’s go-to questions are:
“Describe a time you really disagreed with management on something. What happened?” and
 “Think of a time you had to cut corners on a project in a way you weren’t proud of to make a deadline. How did you handle it?” 
This exercise is all about reactions. 
   “Does the candidate start pointing fingers and say, ‘This is why I couldn't get my job done, this is why this company is so screwed up’? Or do they start talking about how they understood another person's point of view and collaborated on a solution?”

Without further ado, here they are: The Five Essential Questions for the first phone-screen with an SDE candidate:

1) Coding. The candidate has to write some simple code, with correct syntax, in C, C++, or Java. 
2) OO design. The candidate has to define basic OO concepts, and come up with classes to model a simple problem.
3) Scripting and regexes. The candidate has to describe how to find the phone numbers in 50,000 HTML pages. 
4) Data structures. The candidate has to demonstrate basic knowledge of the most common data structures.
5) Bits and bytes. The candidate has to answer simple questions about bits, bytes, and binary numbers.

http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130718210257-15454-the-best-interview-question-of-all-time-to-assess-team-skills

Part 1: Please give me a short overview of the biggest team project you’ve lead or participated in, including when it happened, the purpose of the team, and the results achieved. A cross-functional project would be best for this, if possible.

Part 2: Now I’d like a few more details.

What were the biggest challenges the team faced?
How was the team organized and selected, and what was your exact role on the team?
Why were you selected for the team and who selected you?
Walk me through the biggest team problems and how they were resolved. What was your role in this?
What was the plan, was the plan achieved, and what role did you play in ensuring the plan was met?
Give me some examples of where people sought you out for advice and where you sought others out for advice?
What aspects of the project stressed you the most? The least?
Summarize your personal successes and failures as part of this team project.
How would you rank your performance on the team on a 1-10 scale, with 10 being the best? What could you have done differently to be one point better?
How did you grow as a person as a result of being on this team?
Did you receive any personal recognition from others as part of being on this team?
After about 15 minutes of fact-finding like this, what team skills would an interviewer have learned about you based on just this one project? Now imagine over the course of the interviewing process you were asked this same question for two to three other team projects covering the past 5-10 years of your career. What else would have been learned?

ANAYZING
Dr. Janice Presser of The Gabriel Institute, has created a Teamability® index covering the various roles people play on different teams. I spoke with her in detail about this the other day. My approach to evaluating team skills is a little more rudimentary, but there are a number of parallels. Specifically, I look for the following to determine team skills and fit with the actual requirements of the job:

The growth in terms of the size and importance of the teams the person has been assigned.
Growth over time in the person’s role and influence. For this I'm looking for more involvement at the strategy and planning level, and more cross-functional decision-making.
The makeup of the teams in comparison to the teams the person is likely to lead and participate on in the new role.
The underlying pace of the organization and the stress the team is under to achieve results (e.g., a person handling a turnaround or rapid change is a much different role than someone on a team in a large organization).
Who the person has influenced with specific focus on the level of the person (i.e., peers, subordinates, superiors, executives, outside consultants, and vendors).
The overall success of the team projects and the candidate’s role in achieving this.
