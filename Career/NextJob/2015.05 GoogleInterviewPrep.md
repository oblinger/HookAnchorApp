Hi Dan,

It was great speaking with you this morning! Here is some interview prep material for you to look over. When you are ready to begin the process, all I will need is your resume and your internal references. I look forward to hearing from you soon and getting the  green light!


INTERVIEW PREP:
# Here's the candidate coaching session, it's probably the best place to start: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWbUtlUhwa8&feature=youtu.be
And this one too: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc1owf2-220&feature=youtu.be

# Our interview style may differ from what you've experienced elsewhere, and tends to be highly technical. The interviewer will be interested in the specifics of your past projects, implementations and how you arrived at your conclusions. Your phone interview will cover data structures and algorithms (i.e. Big-O Notation). You may be asked to write code. The phone screen may include topics such as coding, data structures, algorithms, computer science theory, and systems design. It is also recommended that you review Big-O notations also known as "the run time characteristic of an algorithm." Also, one of our senior engineers has recommended candidates read "Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job" by John Mongan and Noah Suojanen to give you an edge--it's likely a good book to have in general.  Two other books that may be helpful are: "Programming Pearls" by Jon Bentley -Programming questions that get you thinking outside of the box; and lastly, "Cormen/Leiserson/Rivest/Stein: Introduction to Algorithms" or the CLR textbook.

# Our interviews tend to involving coding into either a Google doc or a whiteboard--from what other Engineers have told me this is a skill that is invaluable to practice and get comfortable with ahead of the interviews.

#Sorting: Know how to sort. Don't do bubble-sort. You should know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say, quick sort and merge sort). Merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quick sort is impractical, so take a look at it.

#Hashtables: Arguably the single most important data structure known to mankind. You absolutely should know how they work. Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in about the space of one interview.

#Trees: Know about trees; basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. Familiarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees. Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree, and know how it's implemented. Understand tree traversal

#Algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.

#Graphs: Graphs are really important at Google. There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons.  You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code. If you get a chance, try to study up on fancier algorithms, such as Dijkstra and A*.

#Other Data Structures: You should study up on as many other data structures and algorithms as possible. You should especially know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise. Find out whatNP-complete means.

#Mathematics: Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. This is more prevalent at Google than at other companies because counting problems, probability problems, and other Discrete Math 101 situations surrounds us.  Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of combinatorics and probability. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk-- the more the better.

#Operating Systems: Know about processes, threads and concurrency issues.  Know about locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work.  Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a processes needs, and a thread needs, and how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs.

# Here's a pretty good list of some old (and no longer used) interview questions that should provide nice practice coding: http://www.careercup.com

# I have heard that this book can be very helpful:

# Also make sure to check out our Google C++/Python code style guides:
http://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/

# For Java we don't publish anything official, however we base it heavily on
this: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html

 * There is also an Android style guide that is quite similar:
http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html

# It may also be worth refreshing on hash tables, heaps, binary trees, linked lists, depth-first search, recursion (basically CS 101...concepts that everyone knows but sometimes doesn't come right off the tip of one's tongue at a moments notice).

# Many of the questions asked in Google interviews are open-ended because our engineers are looking to see how you engage the problem. Be sure to talk through your thought process about the questions you are asked, as well as your approach to problems and solutions. Ask specific questions if you need more clarification.

# Think about ways to improve the solution you'll present. In many cases, the first answer that springs to mind may need some refining. It is worthwhile to talk about your initial thoughts to a question. A brute force explanation will be received less well than taking time to compose a more efficient solution. Ask clarifying questions if you do not understand the problem or need more information. Many of the questions asked in Google interviews are deliberately underspecified because our engineers are looking to see how you engage the problem. In particular, they are looking to see which areas leap to your mind as the most important piece of the technological puzzle you've been presented.
