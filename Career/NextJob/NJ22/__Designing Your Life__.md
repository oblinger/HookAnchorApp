See Job Matrix in Evernote Journal

KEY CONSIDERATIONS
- FREEDOM:
- ENGAGEMENT:
- PAY:		
  
  
  **FREEDOM**
- **MULTIPLE** -- Idea of working on only one goal for years feels limiting.
  	Want to work on multiple ideas, and follow where they lead, not the money.
- **FOLLOW** -- Ideas not money.  Sometimes importance and money align, and that is great.  But when they don't it is great to ignore the money.
- **SOCIETAL VALUE** -- Ability to work on ideas that w. outsized societal impact
- **NON MEGA CORP** -- Have impact; not primarily/entirely on a corp bottom line
- **TOP EDGE** -- Top edge of my technical ability to operate
- **UNIQUE TO ME** -- ``first reaction should be.  Huh, what?   That is dumb!   or That wont work''
- **CAT PERSON** -- Great joy in choosing tempo / timing of work.  Tend to "get religion" about topic and work frantically.  Other times it is pulling teeth
  
  ==> Such freedom is likely too much to ask.  Just want a chunk of it per day/wk
  
  
  JOB ENGAGEMENT
- Technical Vision Leader -- Spending hours refining and presenting a technical vision.
- Puzzle pieces -- I enjoy thinking how to fit some complex pieces together.
- Talking -- I enjoy presenting and talking about idea.
- Ownership -- Feeling like a own a thing matters
- Value -- Feeling that the work I do actually matters to the world
  
  
  JOB DRUDGERY
- Have to do it now -- When I have to do a thing, even a thing I really want to do, it generates significant resistance.
- Tedious Activities -- Low brain usage activities that are 'too slow' are really frustrating
  
  
  
  
  TECH LEAD
- HARD -- Some part of the task is technically difficult
- DESIGN -- Building APIs, Architectures
- LEAD -- Some aspect of team leading
  
  
  IMPACT
  
  
  
  
  
  
  DRIVERS
- COOL TECH - Spend good fraction of day working on cool tech
- EGO/IMPACT -
- COULD OWN IT - In principle I could own part of what I produced
  
  
  
  COOL TECH
- Based on thinking long about a tough problem
- Innovations I can imagine w/o pencil and paper
- Thinking
- Want job w/o tons of daily requirements
- Want to work on technical & important stuff

#### - Mindmap for IN FLOW

#### 2021.05.06 - WORK VIEW

Work is the technical building of value:
- OWNERSHIP --
	- BUILDING -- I am organized around the idea of _building_ things--BUILDING a THING that has tangible value for some 'customer' community
	- LEADERSHIP -- Having some vision/leadership scope fits best w/ my personality.
- TECHNICAL DEPTH -- Somewhere in my life there needs to be some hard problem solving going on.  Work is a very natural place to find this activity.
- IMPACT
	- JUSTIFICATION -- To myself and to others this output is central to my value.
	- WORTHWHILE - Work should move society forward.  Be a net gain.  The more people affected, the greater the gain.
	- MY PRIME OUTPUT -- For me, my "prime output" in life are the ideas that I realize, in both a technical and social sense.
	- VISION -- some dan-specific ideas are being executed
- ASPECTS:
	- INVENTING / BUILDING -- I spend my time 'inventing' things
	- SOCIAL SYSTEMS -- I am driven towards a kind of 'systems' thinking.
	- ORGANIZATIONAL / REPRESENTATIONAL -- I tend to think about org and rep
- SPRINT -- I am a sprinter, and am comefortable working intensly in a sprint, but I flag if doing admin/low-mental work for too many hours per month.
- MONEY & FREEDOM -- Money buys freedom from the drudgery of work that does not stem from innate desire to create.  Money supports the family, and allows me to go where interest dictates rather than where money is plentiful.
- FULFILLMENT - I am happiest when I am building/inventing.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
  	DETAILS
- TECHNICAL -- At times in my life when my job became more "management" I am driven to create side projects which are technical building.
- INVENT -- I am always 'inventing' things.  Thinking about the problems around me, and trying to see new ways to address them.  I stick with a few problems over many years, but I spend almost all of my time thinking thru solutions that I don't get feedback on, or try out in the world.
- SOCIAL SYSTEMS -- Many of my ideas are "social systems" or self-working process in nature.
- DETAILED DESIGN -- I am driven to think about the biggest of pictures, but then like to try to THINK THRU solutions down to pretty detailed levels.
	  
  	_
#### 2021.05.10 - LIFE VIEW

Why Are we here?
- **EXPERIENCES** -- _For the experiences we have_
  		Measured by the subjective value we attach both at the time and after
- **CONTRIBUTIONS** -- _For the contributions we make_
  		Being part of, giving to, & receiving from others within a society we build
- **GROWTH** -- _For the growth we undergo_
  		To grow in faith, wisdom, and understanding
	  
  	What is Meaning/Purpose of life?
- First, it is an adopted/constructed thing, but that fact should not and does not reduce its validity or importance.
- For me, the "why are we here" goals are ends unto themselves
	  
  	Relation To Others
- In the most important sense, we are peers of all others.
- And building/living a relation with them is central to life.
	  
  	Good & Evil
- Good is moving towards and living our purpose
- Evil is moving away or destroying our purpose, or doing that to another
	  
  	Higher Power
- I live my life beliving there is a higher power, though I will likely never know this with certainty.
	  
  	Role of joy, sorrow, justice, injustice, love, peace, and strife in life?
- These are the backdrop of experiences, contributions, and growth.

>> How: Engaged; Energized
### 2022-04-03  Organizational Systems - Tirelessly setup Obsidian & cleaned texts

### 2021.09.13 -- Writing up yet another idea (Alloy/crypto ownership)

Even as I am trying to really converge on which paths I will take, somehow I find myself thinking thru the details of yet another big idea.

This is really my M-O.  I am positively DRIVEN to think about:

-- yet another idea often focused on:
- Some big impact
- Solving some social-interactions problem
- A technically complex "clever" approach 
  -- My M-O is to simply think hard and at a detailed level about how one would approach all the various aspects of the problem in question.
  
  
  
  _
### 2021.09.03 -- WORK: happy to chat fast; but then hand details off to others
- I enjoyed figure out how to address NIO and Dropwater
- But got ansy after even just 30 min of writing it up.  
 	happier to hand off details
  
  
  _
### 2021-08-30 -- Inbox zero
- a goto activity for me is to read and process EASY emails
- want to switch away from any task when it gets harder except Uniform.
- like to execute easy quick tempo tasks for longer (emails, blogs, recipes)
- tend to want to swap tasks after 15min or so.  even doing this list was a bounce away from doing my three energy giving word maps.
  
  _
### 2021.08.30 -- Waste Time - Blog reading/responding - emails and tasks.
- These days I spend way too much time reading blogs.
- I spent hours giving my feedback to others that I read.
- I don't want huge followers, I am just compelled to engage once I have thought and have come to a conclusion about a subject.
  
  _
### 2021.08.26 -- Procrastinate
- When I get ready to work, I will procrastinate by doing many organizational tasks first:
- read emails
- read medium/blogs
- organize todo lists, do quick items
- do weekly tasks
- _
### 2021.08.26 -- Shelving / recipes
- I really like to organize things, spent hours designing and building shelving for ingredients, getting labels & containers.
- Spent many hours optomizing recipes so they would be time efficient to make.
- So time spent cooking is not valued by me, but time spent ORGANIZING to cook is compelling (even if not really so very fun)
  
  _
### 2021.06.00 -- QL modelling
- When QL came to me with several problems about how to model some aspect of self driving, I really found it fun to brainstorm how to attack the problem.
- I think for me the most fun part, is struggling to see the best way to attach the problem.
- I also like helping others to attack the problem, then not having to screw around with the details involved in actually implementing it.
  
  _
### 2021.06.00 -- QL Hacking
I also then helped out by coding several parts of the data analytics process in python.  This was also fun.  I think doing it all day would get tedious, but if that were <=25% of my time it would be ideal.

_
### 2021.07.25 -- Flighty Freddie
- While working on this activity log, I so badly want to jump to another activity.  (even a valuable one)  but the impulse is so fast that if I followed it, I would be jumping from one thing to the next is a very inefficient way.
  
  _
### 2016.00.00 -- Bizzy Robotics - Early days
I was naturally pulled into my work at Bizzy.  I was happy that in the evening I still was working on Uniform, but with Joe at the office, and with the CTO leadership role, I naturally fell into a pretty driven tempo.
- Worked on my "architecture" stuff too much.
- Didn't attend to impt aspects of leadership (lack of proclivity and skill)
- Gain value from being leader.
- GOOD: at relationship aspect of job.  good at vision and leadership.
- CORRECTABLE:  was too 'hot headed'.
- did not build regular handoff & check in processes
	  
  _
### 2021.07.22 -- Foxglove robotics development platform
Got excited thinking about the idea of making a robotics-dev-studio that is efficient for doing robotics development work.  In general I think I am really motivated and excited to think about making efficient-to-use tools and processes.


_
### 2021.07.21 -- Marcel response (flow)
When I saw marcel's note, I just could not help but to write my response.  Totally threw off my whole morning.  Immediately fought to load some needed open source (which I normally hate).  Each time I tried to work on something else, my brain kept going back to details about it.  really extremely hard for it to not just spontaneously break back into my thinking while on other topics.  Just gave up and wrote the reponse.

_
### 2019.00.00 -- Block Chain
Operated in flow for months trying to build a new block chain.
- The ideas seemed very big.  I imagine large impact.
- Lots of creativity borne from just thinking hard for hours solving hard technical sub-problems.
  
  _
### 2021.07.20 -- Jump jump jump**
When I am working on a thing that I am drawn to, I will push to work more and more hours.  Easily dropping other things I want/need to do.  When it is an activity that I resist, then I find it overwhelming to want to switch away from this thing.  Right now I am trying to do my Job matrix, and I want to switch away.  It stresses me to think about it.  and I am not quite sure what I should put down on it.

_
### 2021.07.19 -- Marcel response  -- couldn't stop writing it!**
I receieved his response email, and I immediately wanted to think thru my response.  Couldn't stop writing it up, until it was done.  Was willing to re-read and correct it -- even as I kinda hate doing that.

_
### 2021.07.19 -- Thinking while walking
When walking my mind repeatedly returns to details of Uniform, and how I might frame and say part of it.  Or less so, how I might resolve this or that techical detail

#### Problem Solving 
THE FUN PART -- 
Find most interesting is the "how is it going to work" part.
Love taking it from the most general to most detailed, as long as not obvious
_
#### Make a difference
I want to do something that matters.  to society.  to science
To a ?smaller? degree, something that is recognized.
_
#### Diversity / Direction
Many things interest me.  I hate the idea of getting trapped thinking about one
I tend to get "caught"

### 2020.10.02 - An assessment of me


Quick Observations:
- IDEAS -- I focus on the technical: the big idea, and technical details
- COMMITMENT -- I systematically dodge certain commitment steps
- CAT -- I jump from idea to idea
- VARIABLE -- impt stuff per day, can vary from near zero to good
- BURSTY -- I can execute well as a burst, but not continuous
 	(except SW or idea coding)
- LIMIT -- seem to have daily limit (3h), not effective after
- WORKY -- I am always "working" its my mental mode
- SWEET SPOT
  
  
  SWEET SPOT -- I dive to this place often
- technical idea
- "of the mind" -- just pencil and paper, no research, etc.
- MINE -- I feel the idea is one other's don't see
- SYSTEMATIC -- idea is a systems idea relating to how things work
- BULLET -- idea is single "silver bullet" for some acknowledged problem
  
  AVERSION
- HOP -- Love pushing deep into an idea, but after certain
- Research
- Execution
- Commitment
- PRAGMATIC SHORT TERM
- RISK AVERSE at commitment stage
  
  
  PRETENDING -- pretending I might do a thing, but knowing in heart I wont
  With JASON flirted, but was never going to say yes, but spent time pretending
