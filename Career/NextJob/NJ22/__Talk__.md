- SLACK -- at google you should be able to "sneak" 3-hours per day in to your schedule of your non-work project.  (felt this was a stretch as he said it, but he did claim it)
- ADVICE:
	- DO STARTUP -- don't do google.  Do your start up idea instead.
	- QUICKLY ASSESS -- don't spend 100K on a prototype.  Find easier way to test BOTH ideas first
- SWE -- There is only one job ladder I should consider: SWE - Software Engineering
	These are the cool kids, make the most money and decisions.
- TECH INTERVIEW -- is just a check box.  Either you are good enough or not.  No bonus for more
- LEVEL -- SWE L6 is most likely level for hiring, but L7 is also possible.
	An L7 can report to an L7, so its mostly about your hiring manager thinking your are amazing
- Director is L8.
- PAY -- L8 ~550.  his guess L8 ~ 625 for SWE.  
	but he knew an MIT eng that got $800+ for L5 ???
- TWO IN BOX -- An L7 SWE TL + L7 TPM form leadership for a project.  (could also have L7 UX)

## 2021-11-04 - FINE - Dreaming big with Google


SUMMARY of KM + GOOGLE
- PROJ: Before joining, Uniform/KM IP is established as a stand alone project
- JOIN: I join Google based on my AI/ML/Leadership background
- SOCIALIZE: I socialized and refine: uniform, marketplace, treesheet ideas
- PROTOTYPE: Using weekends & salary I build a treesheets prototype
- COMMUNITY: Grow a small community of users/contributors that use treesheets for their own information management.
- LICENCING: Create some 'arms length' licencing to satisfy google&community
- INSIDE GOOGLE: 
	- TEAM: Find team focused on KM or has a relevant tool 
	- 20%: Build 20% time project bridging their tool to treesheets/uniform
	- PROJECT: Upgrade this into Google KM project that cements google docs/sheets as bedrock for this KM tech
	- Outside community grows using both internal and external code
- LEAVE GOOGLE?: seems that really growing this community might force me to get external funding, or just too much work 'outside the tent'?



OWNERSHIP
For several reasons I would like to ownership of some core of the KM ideas:
- I spent years working on them, it feels right to in some way own them
- My largest dream is they serve as the nucleus for a free community


CARVED OUT IP -- Coming into Google I have already carved out several pieces of IP, so that their ownership is clear and separated.  Further Google has agreed that I am able to continue work on this body of technology while at Google.  These pieces of tech include:
- UNIFORM - A ecosystem of computational elements.
- TREESHEETS - A knowlege management framework.
- MARKETPLACE - The idea of marketplace that seeks to maximize value transferred (measured both from the perspective of the contributor and the consumer.)
- CODE MARKDOWN - A language independent code format.


LICENCING TERMS -- 
- In order to extend the work while at Google I wonder if make the code open source will facilitate this action.
- I want to licence the IP in a way that allows it to be used as a basis of a marketplace, thus it would need to be 



THE PROTOTYPE
Before (or after?) joining google I have developed this technology to a point where it has basic connection to google docs and google sheets, and is able to be used (as a demonstration prototype) to automatically synchronize data across these

## 2021-11-01 - FINE journal -





TRUTHS:
- TIRED - Part of resistance to day job stems from a feeling of 'tireness'.  Just don't want to work hard, don't feel my health is what it was, don't feel avaiable time is what it was.  
- WASTE - Don't want all my time absorbed into effort I am not motivated by
- ABILITY - Feel my abilities are not as they were, especially w less effort



MASTERY
- Technical Leader in AI
- Visionary ability to think far outside the box regarding societal problems
- Carrying the torch of an idea





Using Google as platform for KM

TIME - It is likely that I can arrange for 10-20hrs per week to work on KM separate from my Google 'day job'

OWNERSHIP - It is likely that I can arrange to OWN key IP around Uniform, Marketplace, and Treesheets, so that continued extension of that work will remain owned by me.

VALIDATION - It is possible that I will have time to validate aspects of the treesheet idea while I am at Google -- this will take years to do, but should work if I can keep focus for that time.

## 2021-10-27 - FINE journal

Dan, I am really in a dark place.  Woke at 4am and could not sleep.  Just gripped by fear and dread.  Without discussing it here, lets just say that the KM idea seems it wont be a workable path.

I have always organized my life around my side projects.  Others played on the weekends, and this is what I did.  The idea to turn one of these into something consequential as quite a draw, and caused me to organized even more around the project with time pressures forced things to drop away.  I am not engaged in nor motivated by much of anything.

At this stage I feel very trapped.  Family obligations absorb my time in activities that do have their high points, but are mostly things that I am happy to be done with when I can be done.  I don't think I am constructed like most parents in the way that I get joy.  And likely the feeling that I have signed on for never-ending labor until I am beyond retirement does not help.

Work is similar.  I am orgaized around building things, so work can definitely have its high points, and can be absorbing at times.  Like my home life, it could be a great secondary thing that I have to do, but a 'have to do' that brings some sense of fullfillment and purpose, as long as it is just a smaller side thing.

But there is no main thing!  Nothing to work towards, except more work.
I just feel tired of life.  not grateful at an emotional level.  And trapped... until I am too old.


~~ ~ ~~ ~~ ~~
PRIDE: How much pride are you taking in this passion or virtue around Knowledge Management?

Definitely my sense of identity and differentiation is centered on my ability to think and to create.  And among others like me, I am further differentiated my drive to identify out-of-the-box to address an age old problems in a transformatively different way.

But I would say my drive to do this is greater than my pride in doing it.  I feel the jury is still out on the ultimate value of those abilities.  Still that does not stop me from trying to assess them myself.  My assessments are all over the map.  At a base level I see competence there, but perhaps a  misguided competence.  At the highest level I a see transformative outputs that would be written in history books.  

I think sense of identity is perhaps the best way to say it.
And more pride in this area than nearly any other area in my life.


~~ ~~ ~~
NERDLAND:  What’s your judgment/ relationship or perspective to entering “Nerdland”?

I was picked on in my farm town for being a nerdly sort.  My response was to embrace the title, and kind of make fun of myself.

Later it was far easier to have the nerd title with it having a more positive connotation.  I would say I do take pride in that title now, and I wear it easily now.

That is, I am not very offended when it is teased, and I tend to make self deprecating 'nerd' jokes when appropriate, but at the same time no one is confused to think that I am not also prideful of and fully owning that status too.

my current world is pretty "pro nerd" so it is less of a thing these days.. it just is.



~~ ~~ ~~
POEM:

In 9th grade I realized my father's pragmatic view of life (which seem logical to me) would lead to a very barren life, so I expressly cultivated an interest and joy in as many things as I could.  This worked! over years I really came to value many diverse things.  Mostly work, but also my side projects over the years after 40 really started eroding this.  At 56 my life matches the stanza of the poem quite well.

run away from sensible advice 

In a way the last 10 years have been a half hearted attempt to do just that.
half-hearted since I did do sensible things along the way.
but after the robotics company (for a solid year) I really did run from sensible advice with a chunk of my time... it was wonderful, then in the second year became disillusioned and needed to focus on my regular job too.

## 2021-10-27 - FINE passion questions / KM trajectory
No matter what work I do I will want to have a dan-project, either as my main project or a side project.


1. What activities have the most meaning to you in your personal life?
Self-directed technical creation work.
Taking Eli to swim class 
Talking with friends

2. What do you most enjoy talking about... What topics could you talk about for hours on end?
Many technical ideas.  Ideas that are about AI-consciousness, Societal problems and solutions, Knowlege management & sharing.  But really any thing where there is a novel idea for a solution.

3. What are the situations and activities when time seems to fly by and you lose yourself in what you’re doing?
In self-directed creation work.  Focused on the interesting parts, done at pace and timings when I am most motivated for it.

4. What activities make you feel most like yourself?
Technical creation.
Alone in nature.
Teaching or directing on a subject where I have mastery.

5. What fascinates you that you want to continue learning about?
Every 'thing' is pretty in interesting.  How the federal reserve banks actually perform their quantitive easing.  How the new corona mRNA vaccine works. etc.
When presented the opportunity I will ususally learn it.
But I am only driven to seek out learning when I need it for some project I am doing...  otherwise it is undirected.


6. What do you do in your spare time? Volunteering?
Hack on one of my projects. (when I am excited by it)
Watch TV or read a book (when I am not)
[I used to do many other things, but most require pre-allocated time]

7. If you were going to write a book about something, what would you write about? 
A detailed technical account of how human consciousness comes about, written as a sci-fi...  It it told from the perspective of an emerging consciousness who learns that infact they were created as a kind of weapon that one AI is using to understand its adversary AI.  Thus our protagonist learns all of his friends from childhood are actually the enemies of "his people" and are trying to use him to understand and be able to defeat them.


8. What have you been continually drawn to over the course of your life?
Learning about things, building things.

Thinking thru novel technical solutions to societal problems.


9. What activities make you feel most alive and engaged?
10.What were your favorite subjects in school?
Math and Science

11.What did you love to do as a child?
Build eletrical gadgets of all sorts.

12.What was your childhood dream?

13.What part of the dream are you currently living out? If you aren't living that dream,
why aren't you?
14.A lot of super smart people like Malcom Gladwell say that it takes 10,000 hours to
master something. What kinds of things (even if they aren’t necessarily career
related) would you willfully choose to spend 10,000 hours doing?
15.What would you do with your time if you didn’t need to work to make money?


Push one or two of my many ideas to become reality.
Continue thinking thru many ideas in more effective ways engaging with others more earlier in my process.



WHAT IS THE VIABLE WAY TO GO FULL-TIME ON KM

THREE MONTHS
- **ASK** -- Ask power users what they want and identify the killer features at the center of the MVP.
- **BUILD & VALIDATE** -- Several early pieces
	- UNICORE/AGENDA/MARKETPLACE -- Using slides, whitepaper, and APIs publish and gain feedback on the core ideas.
	- MARKDOWN -- Since markdown is close to done and seperable.  Show this to get feedback.
	- TREESHEET -- Show the treesheet vision to others and get feedback on the vision; iterate on idea feature set

SIX MONTHS
- BUILD TEXT-ONLY MVP -- Build a text-only Python version of treesheets
- ITERATE -- Iterate text-only version to achieve basic value

NINE MONTHS
- BUILD TK INTERFACE -- Extend system with rudimentary python interface

ONE YEAR
- BUILD CLOUD/JS VERSION 
- ITERATE -- Iterate JS version

15 MONTHS
- SEED FUNDING -- Begin search for seed funding for this effort



HESITATIONS
- I have already spent several years on this will very little concrete I can show to others...  how many more years before I can show something?

## 2021-07-29 - "New Programming Language" CTO
- Connor@matchstar.com   recruiter  949-689-5969  Carolyne Connor
- Michael Antonov  (former head architect for Occulus)
- Matt Shlosberg (chief of staff)  (443)629-8993  matt@formic.vc
  
  
  Questions
  -- what is the purpose of this language
  -- what is the team size now, and within the next year
  -- what is the immediate roadmap / longer roadmap
  -- should I just grab a coffee with Matt
  -- anything I should know or consider about the people involved
  	CTO / Built out a team
  
  
  Matt, 
  The opportunity to work with Michael is likely the most unique opportunity I have ever seen, maybe ever.  My interest would entirely hinge on exactly what Michael is attempting to achieve.  If possible I would love our first conversation to be a rather informal one, just to gauge if I might be a good fit for this role, and whether this role might be a good fit for me.  Regardless of what we find, I am sure the connection will be a interesting one, so I am very happy to meet over coffee to learn more.
  
  I don't have an up to date resume, though I am happy to get it up to date and gather relevant materials if we decide a match is possible.  In the mean time, my linked in is pretty close so I will include that.
  
  As this position is quite specific, I think it will save us both time if I layout the ways I do and do not seem to match what I think you are looking for:
  https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieloblinger/
  
  
  LANGUAGES
- I _**love**_ language design!  Trying to formulate the obvious commonalities spanning modern languages into a single uniform "Ur" langauge has been a passion project for many years.
- In grad school I spent a year focused on formal languages and the building axomic and denotational theories for parallel programming.
- I am a lifelong lisp hacker, this is a beautiful ecosystem where one can invent programming paradigms easily using the meta-object-protocol or simply via funky load time macros.
- I deeply understand the practical memory-layout & code consequences of languages choices.  (e.g. different tradeoffs w/ different implementations of persistence multiple inheritance, or the ways V8 or PyPy compilers performs JIT type analysis to optomize memory layout for objects.)  I enjoy thinking about how to "push the bubble under the carpet" to provide a best approach to some language feature.
  
  
  RELEVANT EXPERIENCES
- At Aeolus Robotics, I was brought in again as a founding CTO.  There I build a team of 60 engineers (40 with very specialized PhDs in various aspects of robotic dexterous manipulation), and delivered a functioning robot into CES within a single year timeframe.  I continued to serve as architect at Aeolus, though the sheer size of the team and our fast growth rate really pulled me increasingly away from the code.  The entire OS was in the many many tens of thoughts of lines of code (likely beyond 100K lines, but I cannot vouch for that with certainty.)
- I co-founded Martian Robotics, where I lead a 13 person engineering team as CTO.  I was also the architect for our Robot OS for an autonomous dexterous robot.
- As a program Manager at DARPA I envisioned, sold, and managed over $200M in R&D prototypes that involved over 500 professors, post docs, grad students and programmers.  Both the Machine Reading program and the Bootstrapped learning programs included >$3M subteam that created the APIs and execution frameworks the teams were required to operate within.  I lead both of these efforts.
  
  
  RELEVANT SKILLS
- Strong ability to lead a teams under time and scope shift pressures
- Strong ability to hire top talent 
  	(even hyper specialists where only dozens exist the world over)
- Strong ability to architect and take stuardship of a deeply technical vision
- Strong ability to ideate with Micheal on language choices...  
  	would be a partner and carrier of a vision (that I believed in).
- Strong ability to roadmap pragmatic paths "spiral" optimally to 
  	(a) reduce key technical risks and (b) gain world mindshare sooner
- Transformation of software engineering via paradigm shift is a life passion.
- Very fast learner of new, abstract, complex ideas.
- Fast tempo in ideation discussions (and LOVE them!)
  
  I have strengths fomenting consensus around deep architectural choices, and designing APIs, rather than spending my hours coding. In my work at Analytics Fire, Aeolus, and Martin, I was the architect that co-developed the APIs and approach constraints these systems were build upon. So I have even more strengths on the CTO than VP of engineering side.

## 2021-07-28 - Meeting with Nick and Michael

-- Need for money fucks things up
	-- I SHOULD be accountable to my 'users'
	-- But need to turn $300K plus profit quickly, limit impact & directions
	-- I had it, and I let it go.
	-- On paper I wrote $150K-$400K before marriage.
	-- Mid-stream on two decade idea.  Sad to drop it.
-- Depressed.  anxious.  shell shocked.  Not in a good decision-making frame

Ready to sacrifice all
- Was ready to sacrifice everything be in a spot where my time is spent thinking hard thoughts, in impactful areas, alternating with deep dives into the market to make one connect.
  	(not clear I have skills.  I have 3 year attention, but maybe not 10yr)
  
  -- Don't feel I spent last 10 years in an effective way.
  	-- Always favored less risky, less motivating paths first, never went beyond
  	-- Nearly all attempt were not well formed, or nor well mentored
  	-- Whole time were string half attempts, made w/ half conviction,
  	-- My aim was lowest risk path to lifestyle, so never reached.
  	-- Good evidence that I do operate very differently given different context 
  
  -- Nick says
  	-- Lack conviction to drive in a single direction.  True.
  But that is because multiple directions are all acceptable
  	-- Perhaps too late to take on the risk of a startup 
  	-- All have significant risks
  
  -- When happy:
  	Technical Ideation.  & Leading a team technically.  Enjoy multiplication.   
  -- Aspects:
  	Enjoy super deep, on multiple.  Thinking time exists. flexibilty which first

- BATSWING --
- VISIO --

## 2021-07-27 - Nick's request info

1. Make a decision tree of the choices you are evaluating & probably outcomes
2. Score the outcomes based on 3-5 metrics you care about
3. Assign probability to the outcomes
4. Talk to like 5 people in the know & ask them for feedback. They will probably give you feedback that updates the tree, especially around probability, but maybe also sanity checks about what it’s like

## 2021-07-04 - Doug conversation

BIG Q:
- Is KMCO real?
- Want Google over Visio anyway?

ASSUMPTIONS:
- TECH-LEAD -- Many tech+leadership jobs fit dan in a general kind of way.
- RARE-DAN -- VERY few will fit Dan in a work-weekends-for-free kind of way.
				- Only long term one w/ maybe enough cash is Uniform
				- Go low-or-high.  Hobby time, or near pefect hit.
					Problem fits dan perfectly. job title allows working on it


ALTERNATIVES
- ?++ GOOG:	Can work less, good money/security, less ownership
- ??? KMCO:  Unicorn-level Time & Energy
- ??- VISIO:	Visio>Google on free time longterm?  (Loose KMCO chance)
		Visio>Google ownership.  Google>Visio on tech?  Know in 1yr.
		Google wins on $, but would in year if VISIO is acceptable.
					
- --- NO LIFESTYLE BIZ: AF is dead, any investors will want a unicorn 	
		trajectory, any biz (even lifestyle) will require 40++ hours per week for a long time.
- ??- CONSULT CO: Seems "mailing it in" at google would be easier and more 	
		rewarding and pay more than consult co.  But could work some.
- ?-- DAN CO: The only potentially viable DANCO seems to be a KMCO above
- ?-- BAT CO: Building any business that dan would not work on for free on his  
		weekends is a BAT CO.  Since lifestyle biz is dead, then Bat Co has a unicorn trajectory, thus it will leave very little room for hobby time.  So don't do it, if it is not a DanCO you are only gaining some ownership over a Google job, but loosing massive certainty and some freetime.

PATH #1 KMCO -- Shoot for KM, but prep for Google
- **_Love_** thinking Uniform/KM thoughts.
- KM space is saturated with others; Incumbents hold the high ground
- Must chase customer's problems, not uniform.  Must be CEO not CTO to start
- would be fun if it worked.
	==> Spend time trying to find KM (Uniform) related startup
	==> Spend time, preping for Google job and building Uniform HOBBY stuff

PATH #2 - Join VISIO
- Spend most time making Visio succeed
- Spend time on KM as hobby


OBSERVATIONS

VISIO 75% SUCKS -- 75% of VISIO cases worse than Google; 
	and 40% are quite bad after a multi-year delay, but 50% are close to Google
- BREAKDOWN -- Here is a slightly optomistic breakdown
		25% Fast fail (<18 mo)  25% Slow fail (<4 yr)  25% Ok growth  25% strong
		20% tech fails; 30% market kills us; 25% ok growth; 25% strong growth
- FACTORS -- Proven demand.  Available customer segments.  Super founder-ish.
	Tech is hard, but not too hard.  Pre-A-round (at A-round it is 10% success)

VISIO NO FERRIS LIFESTYLE -- Unlike my own startup, VISIO is unlikely to transition into longterm lifestyle.
- At 5M/yr w. certainty my own startup can give 500K/yr w. little work as CEO
- at 20M/yr VISIO would likely still not give that for ferris-level work

VISIO PART TIME IS OK -- Both now and in the future, it is likely I can work part time at Visio

VISIO AFTER A YEAR I WOULD KNOW
- Tech would be resolved; first market would have lots of evidence

VISIO REGRET MINIMIZATION
- 25% 1st yr fail -- I would have preferred google
- 25% 4yr fail -- I would have preferred google
- 20% strong co -- I happy I went w Visio
- 30% medium co -- 60/40 18%/12% I would prefer google to visio
	==> 68% prefer google.  32% prefer visio.  
	==> But I can jump to google, but not jump to visio
	==> Reason for Visio is Freetime.  after 2 years, I need it less 

VISIO: Stacking risks
- 25% Founder frustrations
- 25% Tech failure
- 30% Market failure (others take it from us, etc.)
	==> Result 40% success


AF-KMCO AFTER TWO YEARS
- 25% chance of gaining funding on UF-info; UF-ML; UF-mkt
- 20% chance of getting a google job related to this work

UF AFTER N-YEARS
- Best shot for UF is AF-KMCO.  
	More time on it; explicitly connecting to problems


KMCO -- What are the chances that a concerted effort would yield a viable target
- OTHER CO CTO -- CTO w. >150K salary and >1.5% of 100M.  hard: 50+hrs/wk
	Relevant to KM, but not really following a Dan idea


RISKS
- KMCO is riskier than VISIO - SuperFounder; Vision hardtech pivots; 5 dev-yrs
