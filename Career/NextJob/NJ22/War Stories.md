# STORIES

## = MARTIAN/AEOLUS STORIES
### - TESTING FAILURES
#### . Universal Video Validation
   REQ:  Explain in text how you tested it & why that shows it is done.  Include phone video w/ audio.
==> Super super EASY.  No one can argue it is too hard.  avoids generality/stability need for repeatable tests.
==> Ensure testing really did happen.  (just compiled it!  couldn't test easily so said it 'worked')
==> Upper management results porn; Team alignment (hey! that is not done, or not right!)
#### . Not done till upstream top-level system ran

### - 
## = AF STORIES
### - CONTRACTING (customer-forced delivery failures)
#### . In-then-Out Planning; Delivery Timeframes Tied To All Inputs In; Aggressive Tracking & Notify
- Joe at Acme will provide X by DATE1  (with contract having DATE2>DATE1 in planning)
- Aggressive steak holder notification of delivery risks.
#### . In House Testing Upon Delivery
- Ultimately do it for free; but try to charge on next cycle.
#### . Poor Counter-Party Performance Planning
==> Easy to get apriori-agreement for harsh actions on non-compliance; better to get appropriate actions 
==> Example:  Payment and Work-stoppage Timelines
- Massively screwed by an unscrupulous founder - almost sunk the company.
#### . Dual BackLog Management

### - HIRING by direct testing  (Blow their doors off & see what happens.)
#### . BP Sox

- What do you do in first 3 hours, first 3 days, three 3months.
- Outline of an improvement roadmap pitch to the client (drawing from complaints seen in emails)
- One presentable slide from the pitch to the client.
- If you need some missing info, then email the CEO, and invent a reasonable response email and go with it.
  (e.g.  do you have offsite backups of the source code?)

- Do they raise a flag at the email FYI that the a key guy is taking a PTO.
- How do they respond
- Can they play nice with the one dev from the team the ghosted them in order to get server keys.

## >>> MANAGEMENT EXAMPLES <<<
### --- Martian -> Aeolus -> LaneLeader
## >>> MY MANAGEMENT STYLE <<<
- How “hands-on” of a manager are you?  depends.  See delegation
- How do you support an underperforming team member?  see delegation
	-> fast/precise decision to fire
	-> progress towards ownership (see situational leadership)
- Can you provide examples of when you have had to deliver negative feedback?
- What strategies do you use to motivate your team? (see human puzzle pieces)
	-> Ownership.      -> Benefit.  -> Trust/Honesty.  -> Greater Good.

## === MOTIVATING YOUR TEAM? ===
- What strategies do you use to motivate your team? (see human puzzle pieces)
	-> Ownership.      -> Benefit.  -> Trust/Honesty.  -> Greater Good.  

### --- AF: Clean Tech.  Aeolus: Eldercare.  DARPA: Driving AI Field
_
### --- How to maintain trust among co-workers ---
Is is scalable, is it personal
_
## === HUMAN PUZZLE PIECES ===
- Clearly demand what is required; with argument about why; then let them propose 
	Early failure feedback
- Notice where people gravitate; build from that

_
### --- Aeolus:Alexy ---
- Let him operate on his own
- Let him define & own and run his own stuff
	- He defines, we review, raise inconsistencies
	- He delivers, tests and supports integration
- Required to provide short term coaching on specific activities

- Issues:
	- didn't respect others (but he was stronger dev)
		but was polite as long as other was more junior & not too much of his time
	- Poly-phasic sleeper
	- didn't want others defining his tasks/apis, but his work was good
		--> just needed to validate his approach was compatible (& would easily update)
### --- AF: Snowflakes Krzsiek/Attila side gigs,
in the Italian log cabin

Stressed by top down politics
Stressed by ambiguity

## === DELEGATION ===

### --- Ensuring Results:  SMART
How do you ensure that tasks are completed?

--> Let THEM tell YOU when and how they will do it.

- Specific (simple, sensible, significant).
- Measurable (meaningful, motivating).
- AGREED  Achievable (agreed, attainable).
- REALISTIC   Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
- Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).

DIRECTING: 
COACHING:  DARPA slides.  Aeolus: Theo.  AF Hiring
SUPPORT:  Aeolus: Georgios

### --- DARPA: Decks.  DIRECTING -> COACHING ---
### --- AF: PDD.  Supporting --> Delegating ---
### --- AF: Hiring.  Directing --> Delegating ---
### --- Aeolus: 'done' things were never really ---

- Team members said it was done; Even fantisized it was
		but they had only tested their part
		but only run in simulation
		but only ran it in their context
		but it only ran once and is not stable

==> Needed to carefully construct test, that would really show it.	
==> Cell phone video
