# # BIG 
## = DAN-WORK - The kind of conceptual work that drives me
### _

There is a certain kind of work (lets call in DAN-WORK) and this kind of work is so compelling I tend to work on it even when it is not rational to do so; in to the night; sometimes at expense of nearly anything else.

DAN-WORK = TRANSFORMATIVE, CLEVER/HARD, INTERNALIZED, CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM-SOLVING and MENTORING


CLEVER/HARD
- HARD WORK CAN BE BORING -- work that is just hard, like solving some huge calculus problem is just drudgery.  There are no insights to be found or tricks to play then it is exhausting and not very rewarding
- CLEVER WORK IS TOO RANDOM/QUICK -- work that is just one clever trick has no staying power, in one flash it is over, or you have no ideas and make no progress forever.
- CLEVER + HARD -- now we are TALKING.  I can play with the right kind of mathematical puzzle for weeks if it is the right shape.
  
  
  TRANSFORMATIVE
- LIFE MISSION NEEDS CONSEQUENCE -- even if I can play with a hard+clever problem for a long time, it feels hollow.  like binge-watching six seasons of game of thrones in one weekend... it was kinda fun a the time, but also anxiety provoking because you are say...  why the fuck am I doing this?
- A TRANSFORMATION STORY PROVIDES THE ANSWER -- when I can construct a story about how solving this problem will somehow transform things for some group for the better in a significant way, then have no such hollow feeling... it it jet-fuel to work even later into the night!
- SOCIAL -- One common and very satifying way for work to be transformative is for the work to be social in nature, figuring out how society can work better is inherently transformative and hard (if it were easy it would already be done!)
  
  
  INTERNALIZED
- NO PAPER NEEDED -- the very best problems are ones that can be considered for days or weeks without even needing a piece of paper -- just pure thinking.
- LESS LIBRARY RESEARCH -- I am ok needing to do some background learning in order to attack a problem.  Still this learning, unless it involves learning clever insights is a bit of needed drudgery work, it is not the main course.
- LESS COLLABORATIVE -- I am ok problem solving as part of a team, but I like moving fast, and I like the thrill of the solving itself, thus collaboration can be a bit of a speed bump for all of that.  It is ok, and can even be energizing when my partner is complementary and sharp/fast.
  
  
  CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM SOLVING
- PROBLEM FRAMING -- Often the most unconstrained (and thus hardest/cleverest) part of solving a problem is properly framing it in a way that it CAN be solved in a good way.  This is very satisfying work.
- EDGE OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL -- Often the at the fringes of what is known and what is properly framed is where the exciting action is at.  It is close enough in that one might make the transformative difference by properly framing the work, but it is not so far in that the proper framing is easily obtained.  Often this work is called "conceptualizing" a problem.  I freaking love it!
  
  
  MENTORING
- Advising
- Vision --
- Details & Tracking & Plodding -- not so much
  
  
  EXAMPLES OF DAN-WORK:
- BLOCKCHAIN - Building a POS block chain as robust as today's POW chains are
- ELDERBOT - Building an automated human-transport robot for the elderly
- TEAMSAVER - Identifying and overcoming limitations that make remote work less effective than in-person work
- ENGINES-OF-CONTROL - Building a conscious computer
- NANO-SCALE-PROGRAMMABLE-MATTER - How to build programmed 3D-nano structures
- AEOLUS-ROBOT-ARCHITECTURE - Designing the high-level APIs and architecture
  
  
  
  NEGATIVE EXAMPLES
- BORING DETAILS - I desperately want to hand off
- POLISHING - Polishing text describing an idea
- MEETINGS - Being in meetings once all the hard stuff is resolved
- TRACKING - Tracking work being done
  
  
  
  WHAT MIGHT FIT ME?
- BUSY BEE - helping with the framing & large scale solutioning across many hard tasks.

### 2021-11-21 - NINA WORK

HARD - Trying to prove theorems about privacy is very hard.
DELEGATE - Working with student means they do bulk of the tedious writeup.
EXPERT - Working near experts means that my work is efficient

_
### - Conceptual Work

I am positively driven to think about
- the detailed conceptualization of a clever solution to a big-impact problem.
- Love just thinking, 
  
  
  DONT LOVE
- Don't love doing the library research
- I dread coordinating it.
- I resist doing it on a schedule, or for many hours at a time.
- I dread working on more boring parts.
- I dread working on parts where cleverness is not needed.
  
  _
### - Technical center
Clear that my work must have a strongly technical center.
Possible centers:
- Applied ML reseracher
- Robotics project lead
- SOLVE -- dig into range of disparate problems and apply deep tech to them
- MENTOR -- Work as mentor to direct technical work to be done
  _
### - Procrastination
- As soon as I work, I resort to procrastination by 
	organizing / processing easy stuff
- Emails, Medium/Blogs
- Take Nap (I physically feel sleepy in a quick way)
  _
### - Uniform/Marcel
- IMPORTANCE -- feeling that the idea has potential for large impact
- UNIQUE -- feeling that idea that is not generally known, or solved
- PURE THOUGHT -- Struggling to understand/solve using pure thought
- 
- CLEVER SOLUTION --
- EFFICIENT SYSTEM -- love thinking about how to make systems efficient

### 2021-10-24 - BIGGER Dan Fine KM Summary

BIG TRUTHS
- PRETTY STUCK -
- DREAD OF WORK -
- FEAR I CANT -- Just a bit, but not very rational
- FEAR I WILL HATE IT --
- VIEW IT AS 'DEATH' --
- DAN WORK - I am mostly driven to execute Dan work, not really to
- WHY DO IT?
- DRIVEN - Driven towards Dan Work - intrinsically motivating
- TO PROVE I AM RIGHT - To myself, to everyone, to see if I am right.
- DO WHAT I AM BUILT TO DO
- DO WHAT I AM CAPABLE OF
- NOT (very much) for its outcome
- NOT for money or such
- NOT (exactly) for fame
- TO AVOID DRUDGERY
- LIGHT SWITCH - My interest in dan work can be very intense.
	But it can rotate among several.  (will come back)
- LOST COLOR -
- ESCAPE&CONTROL - I am driven to work, but will feel strong need to swap sometimes

### 2021-07-31 - The Past and The Future - Summary for Nick

THE PAST
- MISSION #1 -- Achieve some larger-than-self impact from one of my many ideas
- MISSION #2 -- Spend my time working on diversity of challenging/fun ideas
- SUBGOAL -- Create lifestyle biz needing few hours to support mission 1 & 2
- DIAGNOSIS -- My execution was split & not well informed. Better: do #1 alone
- OUTCOME -- Only some success on #2.  Bit of money & experience too.
  
  THE FUTURE    (analysis of long terms options)
- CONSULTING -- Probably not enough money for long term 
	(maybe on-par w/ google if fulltime, but that would suck more long term)
	(could be used to stretch a medium term situation longer)
- AI SAFETY -- Not enough money for long term; and not a forever mission
- STARTUP -- Too risky to consider now unless I am dying to do it
- LIFESTYLE BIZ -- Too slow & too risky now.  
	Jason's gig is best bet in that direction, but still risky & slow.
- BIG CO -- Likely this is the only real option for long term
  
  THE PRESENT   (medium term window 1-2 years)
- TOP COVER -- Use AF payout as 'top cover' to wife for gap before big co
- TOP COVER -- Get some affiliation as 'top cover' for future employer
- GOAL:
- ACTUALIZE -- Get stuff 'out of my system' before big co jail
 		==> into form where I can claim it as protected IP
- MOON SHOT -- Take long shot on 
	  
	  
  SATISFYING WORK (more items below are better, but not all are required)
- HARD THINKING - Not just execution, solve hard-to-think-thru technical tasks
- CLEVER DETAILS --
- HELPS THE WORLD (NOT MOSTLY JUST BIG CO)
  
  
  EXAMPLE AWESOME TASKS
- TECHNICAL PROBLEM FRAMING -- Hearing about a novel technical challenge, and thinking thru how one might address it at a detailed technical level.
- e.g. how to model task in order successfully apply ML.
- e.g. how to architect an approach

### 2022-03-09 - Post Amy Kruse Thinking
#### ROCKS
##### THINKING FAIL
- My love of thinking deeply about problems is NOT a good path for founding a startup.
- I CAN found, but it needs to be done in very different way
- My ideas of Uniform, AI-safety, and Knowledge Management are all POOR starting points for a new business.
#### DEEP TECH
- Happiest when I am learning and problem solving around hard ideas
- Like to read/learn
- Like to brainstorm how to solve something
- Like to advise / mentors others around such ideas
### 2022-02-22 - Latest Thinking

**PARTIAL BREATHER?** -- Consider breather.  Already have good retirement position.  Significant lift to get to GREAT position.  Thus consider lower income paths now, if strongly preferred.

**MUST LOVE IT IF CTO/VC** -- Energy, but must LOVE it.  These paths seem notably harder, but could be fufilling, and lucrative.  Consider them if inspired by the work.

**APPLIED-AI** -- Utilize AI & Mgt background to lead in a more researchy role. 





Talk about Deep.  
- several times you said, he could be part of our coaching.
- gives talks maybe I 


LIGHT HEARTBEAT / HEAVY TACTICAL
- Word smithing
- Outreach strategy
- Retooling strategy & validation

- NOT MONEY -- It is now too late to start a business in order to make FU-money.  But will have enough to retire on in a few years if RZ does well.
- MIDWIFE -- Bring an important idea into existence... this is my purpose.
- LOVE&LIVE -- 
- THINK HARD -- I love to think hard about a valuable thing.  
	This is my passion that can drive effortless action, but it needs to somehow tie to something of import

Luis,
You got me thinking about how to validate my treesheets KM idea before prototyping it.  I think it is a very wise path, just not the most natural path for the more engineering minded.  Let me take a shot a what this might look like, and see what you think:

	- CONFIGURATOR PRODUCT -- 
	- AF PRODUCT -- 
	- GOOD JASON SITUATION -- >$150K
	- GOOGLE PROJECT LEAD -- 

	north star:
	- FERRIS -- Think big thoughts, side projects, >$200K for 15hrs/wk of ok work
		- DRAWN -- I am drawn to certain ideas, but they are hard to commercialize
	- TECHNICAL MISSION -- Interesting technical mission to solve; some leading?


	UNIFORM   (less than 50/50)
	- Code Markdown -- 
	- Value Markets -- 
	- LAL10 -- 

	We know the challenges. They are big. So do you want to take a run at uniform?
	=> yes, but not a full throttle run at the ground. need feedback I may never get 


	- Jason's idea is pretty fast to test & could scale big
	- 30K teams.  10% penetration.  $100/mo profit  =  3.6M per year  For schools


### 2021-02-17 - Dan's Mind & North Star
#### VALUES
- **AUTONOMY** - Freedom to contribute w/o concern for cash
	- FRANKLIN - Accomplished much because he didn't need to chase $.  99% do
	- OBLIGATIONS - Family
- **FRONTIER++** - Make a Dan-idea real.  
	- CMKS - Componential & Minimal Knowledge Systems
- **FUN** - Techno/_Conceptual_/Abstract Prob Solving; 
	Systems inventing; Big Ideas; Impact; Diverse
_
#### NORTH STARS
- CMKS (Corp/Individual KM; open-src data-bricks)
- DEEP LEARNING DEVICES
- SMART ENERGY
_
#### STRENGTHS
- Articulate / Persuasive
- Quick conceptual competance
- Creative problem solver
- Sprinter
- Raw conceptual processing power
- Single variable optomization
- Very analytical
- Span the stack from very high level to very low level
- Human optomism; trust; works 
#### WEAKNESSES
- I'm a dreamer  (Over scoping; going too big)
- Sprinter
- Over application of Single variable optomization
- Confusing; story changing too fast
- Big Decision Paralysis
- Time Thief for others; Time theif for self


##### DEATH OF THE AUTONMY DREAM - FRANKLIN / FERRIS
- _**Franklin**_ did much - he established printers w/ someone else running it
- _**beyond-cash**_ -He wasn't the richest; importantly wasn't trying to get richer
- _**did much**_ -Did not rest!  He accomplished what his innate abilities allowed. 
- _**99% cant**_ try.  Could do much since no one else is there.
- _**lost?**_ - beyond-cash used to seem possible for me
- _**long shot**_ - Now is seems more of a long shot
- VALUES:  fits w. dan ideas; impact

##### Big Rocks
- CMKS >30-40% - Take shot on product goal
- AF-AUTONOMY >40-50% - Take shot on lifestyle goal
- VISIO - Try it first; leave if sucks
- GOOGLE - Train up for specialty so I can have a little fun


1. Is being a painter my number one
2. x
3. Not Jason vs. 


##### ROLLUP
- **ALL IN MCKS** -- It is a risky all-in bet right now.
	AF very unstable now; might be around afterwards.
	Else go to Google if all fails.
- **AF-FIRST** is on borrowed time. if I am going to do uniform is must be soon.
	If doing AF lifestyle first it will be years before stability
	If doing AF lifestyle at same time, one will suffer significantly
	- Requires 10x revenue for success than Visio
- **Visio** seems a higher probability success (than some unnamed AF approach)
	=> Negotiate Equity w. Jason / Verify actuality / 
	=> Drive hard to build solution (Small time for CMKS)
	=> After 2 years kick off side project in MCKS
	=> After 4 years drop to fewer hours & crank on CMKS  (trusting in equity!)
	??? - talk candidly w. Jason about side gig @ 2Y
	??? - side gig, edit equity if raise on it.
- **Google-Next**, get stuff published to protect IP & get feedback
	Then to Google having an MCKS "hobby"
	Retire after 8 years to work on MCKS or other stuff
- **Ditch Autonomy Dream -- No MCKS; No Franklin** 
	Visio: Fun leadership, Learning techical, 
	Google: good pay, (goof around w/ info systems on side)
	GAI: Go deep on gai, then Google self


##### ALL-IN-MCKS - What would this look like?
- AF - work many hr/wk to keep pushing for AF stability & AF-lifestyle. AND
- FEEDBACK ON
	- Presentation & Detailed Examples; Feedback on: 
		- Value Markets; 
		- Corp KM; 
		- OpenSrc DataBricks
	
- COMMUNITY
	- Smallest prototype to support a community (w support)
	- Build tiny DIY community
- RAISE OR BOOTSTRAP


##### APPROACH
- -> CMKS Feedback -> If no traction, then hobby
- AF-lifestyle 


##### DECISION TREE
**BIG Q**: am I going to have a real DAN-IDEA bat swing?
- YES: 	 then stay with AF and make it happen in 2021-2022
			very risky.  50/50??  and need to really focus on it.
- NO: 


ANSWERED QUESTIONS:
**CHILL Q**: CAN I CHILL w. <$100K for 5 years?

##### CORE IDEAS
- **CMKS** - Compo-Minimal Knowlege Systems
- **Knowledge Mgt** - 


##### Framing to Jason
- The Good: 
	Solid-team, specific-strong-idea, 
	My role is primarily technical leadership in area w/ significant experience
- The Bad:
	On path to towards impact projects.
	Time delay to cash


##### THINKING
CMKS -- Greatest driver is CMKS.  
- 50/50 chance I could shoot for a real business there.
- If I don't do it now, likely never will
JASON
- 4 years output should be much greater than $4M @ 15% = $30M sale = $10M/yr ~10K customers
- If I leave @ 4yr my 15% is in jeopardy
- Cannot Feriss this
- Will require landing multiple markets or massively dominating one.
AF

FERISS
- Business that is stable and throws off $1M profit is lifestyle
- Needs > $3M revenue


JASON OR GOOGLE AT EMOTIONAL LEVEL
?? Jason?
++ Potentially Greater Control
-- Money could feel weird, but after year 2 if >150K and thriving bus, then ok


JASON OR AF lite + on side driving towards DAN-IDEA
AF-lite (but not so likely to work)
-- 30-40% chance that we can figure out strong consulting model
-- Letting me earn >200K @ 15/hrs week


JASON VS AF PRODUCT
AF-product
SOLID PRODUCT:  < 50/50
-- feels so much safter to be in control the business
-- will need hard work for several of years, but if aiming lifestyle then
   maybe some relaxing.  maybe.
IFFY PRODUCT:
-- Better to go with Jason, at least I am focused on tech & cool tech
