B.) Deeper Exploration/Intentionality: if he wants to explore what he'd really like to do next, what he'd be most passionate about doing or how to go about making these bigger career decisions with intentionality, here are two fantastic coaches that I've known for quite a while and recommend highly - I mentioned this to each of them, so go ahead and have him use my name if he contacts them (or lmk if he wants me to connect him in email to them, happy to do so. (Note: I actually do this kind of coaching work, but I don't have availability for him right now, sorry!)

	To: Nick Allen <nick@nickballen.com>


	Hi Nick - I'm so sorry I didn't get back to you sooner on this!  Yes, here are some folks you could refer your friend to, depending on which areas he wants to focus on with a coach:  
	A.) Career Search/Tactics:  if he wants someone to help him tactically with his exec job search, another coaching colleague of mine recently recommended this coach - I don't know her, but my colleague said she's great at what she does:  Meredith Mehlberg (or he could try someone on her team @) https://meridethmehlberg.com. I think they focus on Career Coaching with Execs too.
