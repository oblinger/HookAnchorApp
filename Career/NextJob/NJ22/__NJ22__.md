### 2020-10-02 - An assessment of me


Quick Observations:
- IDEAS -- I focus on the technical: the big idea, and technical details
- COMMITMENT -- I systematically dodge certain commitment steps
- CAT -- I jump from idea to idea
- VARIABLE -- impt stuff per day, can vary from near zero to good
- BURSTY -- I can execute well as a burst, but not continuous
 	(except SW or idea coding)
- LIMIT -- seem to have daily limit (3h), not effective after
- WORKY -- I am always "working" its my mental mode
- SWEET SPOT
  
  
  SWEET SPOT -- I dive to this place often
- technical idea
- "of the mind" -- just pencil and paper, no research, etc.
- MINE -- I feel the idea is one other's don't see
- SYSTEMATIC -- idea is a systems idea relating to how things work
- BULLET -- idea is single "silver bullet" for some acknowledged problem
  
  AVERSION
- HOP -- Love pushing deep into an idea, but after certain
- Research
- Execution
- Commitment
- PRAGMATIC SHORT TERM
- RISK AVERSE at commitment stage
  
  
  PRETENDING -- pretending I might do a thing, but knowing in heart I wont
  With JASON flirted, but was never going to say yes, but spent time pretending
