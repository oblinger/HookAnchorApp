Melanie,
it is so nice that you shared your resume as a guide   (I am definitely going to think back to the resume when I finally get around to updating mine!!)

I was really skeptical when I heard you suggest  **PICTURES** on a resume?!?   but it totally works here.

I am not sure that everyone has a cool picture like your DARPA car…. so I would only put a picture if it had that kind of impact.
but your timeline picture is really very very nice.  it shows in seconds what you have been up to!!

I also like your use of color!

If I just read the colored parts of your resume, it already tells a compelling story, and if I care about one of your bold assertions
     ROBOTICIST  I only have to read the text immediately after it to see why how it is that you ``own’’ that word.

and again in your work section, the names of the companies along with the title right after it, is probably the best 4 word description
to be in COLOR.  then I can dive into the job that seems most relevant.


I also liked framing your objective at the very top:   ``Seeking bay area job’’   indeed maybe that also deserves to be in color.


lots to like (and emulate!)
