### - Analytics Fire -- Co-founder & CTO
Co-founded a boutique consultancy built to help multibillion-dollar companies design, develop, and productize AI, analytics, IoT, and infrastructure solutions.

Tenure spans more than 45 software and analytics projects involving a 60-member workforce building and operating on behalf of clients including Arthrex, Boston Scientific, Enphase, iCracked, and SunPower.

Design and productization engagements include ML / vision-based installation design and productization of an automated, one-touch sales channel leveraging satellite data, custom geometric reasoning, and deep learning to eliminate human-in-the-loop solar installation; greenfield-to-operations development of a computational infrastructure (omnibus solution) cited by the Fortune 1000 client as “the largest single driver of new revenue growth” in a single quarter; shepherding the company’s greenfielding, build, launch, and operation of a complex software ecosystem controlling $2B in clean energy IoT assets; and building software and infrastructure enabling video connectivity for a medical device company’s telerobotically operated surgical unit.

### - Aeolus Robotics  --  CTO & Head of U.S. Operations
Tapped as employee #1—following Martian Robotics acquisition—to reimagine Martian IP as an eldercare robotic, ultimately deployed through an exclusive relationship with a Japanese conglomerate.

Tenure included demo prototype at CES 2017, helping secure significant follow-on funding; building a 60-member, 8-discipline follow-the-sun HW / SW R&D organization (40+ PhDs, 20+ engineers) remotely distributed across 6 continents, using scaled recruiting to accommodate 2,000+ applicants.
#### Before 2020
Founded Martian Robotics which sold to Aeolus. Designed and lead development of Aeolus OS — a Realtime & AI based operating system for robotics aimed at fine grained manipulation in unstructured “human” environments.  Sold core technology into Aeolus then hired and ran a 60+ person Engineering team with 20+ PhDs in a variety of Robotic sub disciplines from Vision, manipulation, realtime control, and navigation.



### - Martian Robots --  CTO & Co-founder
Recruited by founder (former CEO of Neato Robotics) to support the vision of bringing general purpose robots into the home worldwide.

Led 13-member team in inventing robotic arm to “clean any bathroom surface,” using adaptive AI, advanced planning, and sensor feedback loops to create closed-in controlled bathroom wiping.

Innovations included novel topological transform to map any 3D surface onto the 2D plane; and achieving 10x to 100x cost reduction using techniques like motion-by-feel.
### - Pay By Group -- CTO/Co-founder
Tapped to reimagined consumer transaction flow for group purchases on travel and retail websites, building PayByGroup’s original payments engine and workflow for multi-stage recover of contingent purchases.
### - DARPA -- Program Manager
Recruited to imagine, build, and evolve pioneering AI and ML at the forefront of innovation for private industry, academia, and the U.S. military—serving as one of 130 program managers collectively adjudicating research award applicants and managing ~250 R&D programs.

Leadership included appointment by IPTO’s director to serve on the 9-member Senior Advisory Board, identifying IPTO’s high-visibility cognitive / computation priorities, along with budgetary justification delivered biannually to the U.S. Congress. Hand-picked by the agency director as one of two PMs briefing the Secretary of Defense.  
  
Owned a $200M+ technical research portfolio to advance machine learning worldwide, including funding and overseeing 100+ scientists.  
  
Three large AI / ML innovation programs included Darpa’s Machine Reading Program* (MRP), Bootstrapped Learning Program, and Transfer Learning Program.  
  
Highlights included aiming $125M at the development of fused ML and NLP in mapping unstructured information into structured data; and setting the stage for ongoing transformation from statistical ML to human-like, multi-paradigm ML, and closing the gap between ML and human learning.  
  
* Darpa’s reading programs, like MRP, have fueled a revolution that later unlocked field-changing value. MRP tech is core to the IBM Watson system that beat world Jeopardy champion, Ken Jennings.  
  
Oversaw 11 early-stage, Seedling and Sapling Award-winning AI / ML / Cyber programs, including AI explorations such as Attacking Time (pervasive, OS-level capability, inoculating systems against viruses and worms), and Never-ending Learning (statistical triangulation to uncover latent world knowledge underlying web data).
### - IBM Research -- Research Staff Member
Recruited from grad school to apply ML and analytics to K-12 developmental reading comprehension—collaboratively developing six products and securing 12 patent filings / publications.  
  
Tenure included making large-scale Programming by Demonstration (PBD) practical—developing core automated scripting algorithm that earned best runner up award and was integrated into the IBM Rational software suite (a $2B acquisition in 2002).  
  
Algorithmic research combined sequence alignment background in bioinformatics with structure-based learning algorithms to learn structured scrips with loops and conditionals. Won 12 FTE-years of “Adventurous Research” (IBM funding; <5% acceptance rate).  
  
Additionally, developed speech analytics for reading tutor rolled out across 5,000+ elementary schools nationwide as part of IBM’s Reinventing Education Program, and later extended as a core tool of IBM’s philanthropic ESL programs nationwide.
### - Columbia University - Adjunct Professor
Appointed as part of IBM tenure to serve as co-instructor for “ELEN E 6880 Statistical Pattern Recognition,” teaching cutting edge of ML at Columbia University, helping cultivate the field of AI and IBM’s research scientist pipeline.
