\begin{itemize}

	\item Designed and implemented a 
	{\em frame based object oriented language for home automation}.
	This language is a layer built over both SMALLTALK and PROLOG.
	It inherits object oriented message sends from SMALLTALK and 
	the ability to program using constraints from prolog.

	\item Implemented {\em XINU}, a multi-tasking networking operating
	system written on a bare IBM-PC.

	\item Designed and implemented a dialect of {\em LISP} for
	6809 based personal computers.  The interpreter uses a shallow
	binding scheme and has fifty-five primtives most of which are
	list manipulation or control flow primatives including:
	CATCH/THROW/UNWINDPROTECT, error trapping, and a non-local
	GO that can change the context in effect.

	\item Implemented a recursive-descent complier for a 
	statically-scoped language similar to PASCAL.
