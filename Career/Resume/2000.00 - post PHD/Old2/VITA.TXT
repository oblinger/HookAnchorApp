EDUCATION
  Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Illinois (expected October 1997)
  M.S.  in Computer Science from Ohio State University, GPA 4.0
  B.S.  in Mathematics and Computer Science from Northern Kentucky University
           Summa Cum Laude  *  GPA 3.92 overall  *  GPA 4.0 in both majors

Thesis: "Plausible Inference: A knowledge-intensive, inductive 
         approach to domain modeling"
Doctoral Committee: Gerald DeJong (chair), Shankar Subramaniam, 
                    Larry Rendell, and Caroline Hayes

RESEARCH INTEREST AND CAREER OBJECTIVES
  Areas: Data Mining, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and 
         Computational Biology.

  Objective:  A full-time position that bridges research and product
              development.  Ideally this position requires significant
              interpersonal interaction.

PROGRAMMING SKILLS
  C, LISP, object-oriented languages (C++, Java, Smalltalk, CLOS),
  programming interfaces (X-windows, UNIX, DOS), UNIX system administration,
  Pascal, BASIC, and many assemblers.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Research Assistant.  University of Illinois.  (6/95 to present)
* Encoded expert's knowledge of biophysics.
* Implemented an inductive learning algorithm that used this encoded
  knowledge to mine rules from 4 Gigs. of data on protein structures.
  This algorithm is implemented in a massively parallel fashion on a 
  512 node CM5 supercomputer.

Research Assistant with Gerald DeJong.  University of Illinois.  (8/89 to 6/95)
* Developed formal and computational models of plausible inference.  This
  technique combines general but inaccurate expert models with specific and 
  accurate entries from a database to learn accurate and general rules
  describing the data. 
* System Administrator for the AI group's file/mail/web/printer/xdm services.
  Designed and maintained a three-level backup scheme for this 50-seat network.

Software Engineer.  IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.  (5/89 to 8/89; full time)
* Collaborated on the initial design of an expert system that automatically
  generates configurations for IBM mainframe computers.
* Represented the T.J. Watson research group at several planning sessions
  involving managers from five divisions across the U.S. and Europe.  At
  these meetings I presented the group's initial design.

Teaching Associate.  Ohio State University.  (9/87 to 5/89)
* Designed and taught a course new to OSU's curriculum: LISP (CIS 459).
* Instructor: Pascal for Engineers (CIS 221; four courses).
* Invited to teach  an OSU-accredited, off-campus version of Pascal (CIS 221)
  at Bell Core Corp.  I was selected for this position by the chair of the
  CS department from over 60 candidates.

Research Associate.  Ohio State University. (3/88 to 5/88)
* Developed the semantics, designed, and implemented a data-directed control
  flow mechanism used to drive part of the AI Tool Set.

Software Engineer.  IBM.  San Jose, CA. (6/88 to 9/88; full time)
* Designed and implemented task synchronization primitives used in a 
  run-time library that supports more than five languages on the IBM 370.
* Composed user's manual and document justifying the correctness and
  efficiency of the implementation on a multiprocessor system.

Mathematics Tutor.  Northern Kentucky University. (1/84 to 6/85)
* Tutored Calculus, Fortran, and Pascal.

Software Engineer.  Doug Ragland.  Lexington, KY.  (12/84 to 8/86)
* Designed and implemented a text processing and programming environment for
  quadriplegics.  This environment included an extensible programmable editor,
  hierarchical note retrieval facility, and an auto-word-completion
  dictionary; system was designed to minimize keystrokes.

Physical Attendant.  Northern Kentucky University.  (5/84 to 8/84; full time)
* Attendant for a mute quadriplegic.  I assisted him in all functions, 
  including:  dressing, eating, swimming, taking class notes, etc.

OTHER EXPERIENCE
* Designed and implemented a full-screen, source-level LISP tracer.
  (See my web site to download this and other utilities I have developed.)
* Developed and used PAL, a language for writing object-oriented, personal
  information management tools (28,000 lines).
* Implemented an efficient LISP interpreter in assembly for a 6809 processor.
* Wrote a native code compiler for a statically-scoped, procedural language.
* Implemented a simple UNIX-like multiprocessing operating system for the 8086.
