### 2019.02.00 - Turbot Materials

Bob, David, Paul

Great to meet you!

As per requested, here is a quick visual example of a polished interface we recently delivered: It is a vanity dashboard that shows off solar energy production & consumption for companies that have purchased solar power systems for their commercial buildings & want to earn recognition from their customers that they are "solar friendly:

We also recently completed another project for that same client that we are SUPER excited about it: We used ML & deep learning to automate manual steps in the design & sales of residential solar power systems:

(The presentation about what we built starts at 22:50)

For this project we pulled together 2 PhDs in computer vision, 1 in ML, an expert in GPU programming along with a full stack software team to built a fully integrated solution. It was first presented at Google Cloud Next just a few weeks ago. It will be launched publicly within the next couple of months.

As per requested, here is a quick list of our core competencies:
Front-end stack: React, Angular, & Vue
Back-end stack: Ruby, Python, JavaScript
Embedded: C/C++, embedded Python
Scientific computing: Python, C/C++
Within stacks we are fairly flexible about what libraries, integrations, & approaches we work with.

Here is our rate card:
$125/hour - SWE, DevOps, & Release Management
$29/hour - QA & Test Engineering
Our engagement model involves working in a "pod" structure, the minimum configuration is about $10k/week. We work fast & don't have a minimum contract duration.

We love working with mission critical infrastructure -- both safety critical & business critical systems. Because of that we would be excited to partner with Turbot!

Take care

Nick
