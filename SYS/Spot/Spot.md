- MAYBE: auto scan for broken links in spot

- Multiple ALL_CAPS prefixes in the spot defs file indicates a "jump" table
- Scan KMR finds definition file (error if multiple found)
- Scan of Jump content indicates old jumps, deleted jumps (with given prefix), and new jumps to add at end.
- Should look for suffixes as well as full entries when looking at content.  So AMA Kindle or just Kindle.

- Figure out why we get repeated entries in the "::" sections of the doc

- spot grab 1pass mastadon. (got a crash)


- - spot: when folder is missing either delete command, or just change the group of the command to be "broken"
