 Lead with the Problem (30 seconds)

  "If you're drowning in thousands of files across Obsidian, Notion, Google Drive, bookmarks, and local folders - and you're tired of searching through folder hierarchies or remembering where things are - this tool solves that with a simple insight: you already have names in your head for the important stuff, let's just use those!"


  Position as: "A universal launcher for your personal knowledge - like Spotlight/Alfred, but it actually knows YOUR mental model"

  Key Differentiator

  "This isn't another note-taking app. It's a meta-layer that works WITH Obsidian, Notion, Google Drive, bookmarks, PDFs - anywhere your knowledge lives. Think of it as the missing 'instant access layer' for people who already have too many tools."


### Target

  Target Early Adopters Who Feel This Pain

  Perfect for:
  - People with 1000+ files scattered across multiple tools
  - Those who've tried and abandoned complex tagging systems
  - Knowledge workers juggling multiple projects
  - Anyone who spends too much time searching for that "thing from last month"

  For Beta Recruitment Post

  "Looking for 10 beta testers who:
  - Have 500+ documents/notes scattered across multiple apps
  - Currently waste time searching for things they KNOW they have
  - Are willing to spend 2 weeks teaching the system their personal naming patterns"

  The promise: "Stop searching, start accessing - using the names already in your head"


### Demo
  The Hook Demo (show, don't tell)

  Don't explain the theory. Instead, show:
  1. Type "q2" → instantly opens Q2 financial report in Excel
  2. Type "bbc" → opens BBC website positioned on second monitor
  3. Type "reveal" → jumps to specific chapter in your book manuscript
  4. "No folders, no tags, no searching - just type what comes to mind"
