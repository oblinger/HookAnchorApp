**build and maintain the front-end user experience for displaying processed content within PlayHQ's mobile applications**


I think is enough hair on the contract with PlayHQ that is it good for each of you to put eyes on it:

  

  

Here are some concerns:

  

7 (c) receive game metadata, fixtures, and scoring events from PlayHQ via the Game Data APIs;

This requires us to write specialized code to pull data from their end points, and translate it into our jobs format.  We discussed an approach where they submitted jobs to our API in our format.  This is additional work/risk on our side to do it as described here.  

Perhaps we want to get "credit" for this shift?  but I assume we should roll over and do this.

  

  

7 (f) Maintain infrastructure to meet the Processing SLA of 6 hours or less from video upload to highlight delivery, and improve the Processing SLA by 1 hour every 3 months commencing from the Go-Live Date, with a minimum target of 2 hours.

  

Woah, we never talked about less than 6 hours!  And terminating at 2 hours is WAY below where we are now.  And we could be required to do this even if they are only giving us a small number of games!   We must stay on RTX6000 processors to get quick execution, but that may not always be the cheapest.

  

If we accept something new in this area, I think we should force them to give us minimum numbers of games for each speedup, and I really fret for 2 hours.  This includes upload and result pushing back to them.  Maybe 3 hours after the video is fully uploaded to us, to the time we send first notification back to them.  But really here we are taking on a large new requirement.  maybe we should be getting something for this, or not doing it.

  

During the Term, SportsVisio must not, within the Partnership Territories: 

provide its video processing services, technology, or APIs to any other sports management platform, ...

  

There are a number of terms in this section in the doc 7(h) that sean and jason should really look at.  They would be limiting our ability to partner for 2 years!  And I worry this contract is not just about AI, but is about all of our services.

  

not use facial recognition or biometric identification technology in any video processing;

  

We do build per-player recognition tech, when we discussed this in our meeting they seemed ok with this usage, but we might want to reaffirm this is ok, by having an email from me or Jason to an appropriate counter party where we say we do X, Y and Z and feel this is within the terms of the contract.  That way we have coverage that they are aware of what we are doing.

  

  

(j) integrate with the Game Data APIs provided by PlayHQ in order to receive the Game Data, at SportsVisio's own cost, and comply with clause 7.3 in doing so;

  

@Sam Corbitt It not clear what clause 7.3 is.

  

  

  

7 (m) maintain event-tagging accuracy of at least 85% baseline, and improve event-tagging accuracy by 5% every 6 months commencing from the Go-Live Date (i.e., 90% by Month 6, 95% by Month 12, with a cap at 95%);

  

this is another requirement that was never discussed.  I think they are just fishing for better terms to see what they can get.  I think we should hold the line on this one.  I think there is a large chance we will fail the 85% number on at least on of our stats now.  And I have no basis for understanding how much we can improve them over time.  Based on prior experience, I think the chances that we are at 95% six months later even with a significant team are very low.  

  

I think, is folly to sign up for scientific advancements that do not follow any predictable schedule.

  

My thought is that we push back completely on this point.  

  

If they keep pushing, we could tell them we should complete this (tiny) contract first, and then sign up for a notably larger number of guaranteed games (hundreds of thousands of them) in order to fund the work we will need to drive accuracy up.  I prefer to not even open this gambit if I don’t need to.  Signing up for science on a schedule is a notable uncontained risk.

  

  

7 (n) provide PlayHQ with access to all gamification features, badges, awards, and achievement systems generated by SportsVisio's technology, including but not limited to milestone-based achievements (e.g., "Thief" for 50 steals, "Sharpshooter" for shooting percentages, "Triple Double" achievements), player rankings, and performance badges. PlayHQ will have the right to display, distribute, and rebrand these gamification elements within the Platform and associated applications;

  

Again this is a requirement that was never discussed.  At a technical level ranking and counting is easy stuff.  But all of that logic is buried in our SW system.  it is not exposed outside of our app (maybe one can get it in a very complex way using our backend APIs, but I don’t think we want to make all of that hair be permanently exposed even if they were crazy enough to try to use it.  

  

In order for their games to have all the achievements etc. they would need to frame all of their games into leagues, programs, etc. just as we do in our app.  I bet this is just too much work to make it worth doing.

  

This feels like a place where we don’t say no, but we say, “this would probably require too many changes to their data structure and work flow to make it worth it.  (Unless they wanted to embed their data in our app, and I expect this would be a separate contract.)

  

  

7 (q) [implement content moderation processes and procedures as agreed between the parties - to be confirmed]; and

  

maybe it is ok to just say yes to this and negotiate it later as we learn what customers require.

but they have said some things like pixelating faces etc. that would not be 100% and would take some notable work.

  

  

  

7 (r) comply with all Australian privacy and data protection obligations under the Privacy Act 1988

  

Sam, we looked briefly at summaries of this privacy act, it seemed reasonable, but it has not been looked in any depth.

  

If we are just prepared to say “ok” on this point, I think we need to make it clear that PlayOn must be responsible for all the customer facing aspects of this privacy act.  e. g. We cannot be in the position of gaining consent etc. that is on them.

  

Here is a quick summary of some of the parts of this act:

  

  - Governs how organizations collect, use, store, and disclose personal information

  - Contains 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) covering things like:

    - Getting consent before collecting data

    - Only collecting data you actually need

    - Keeping data secure

    - Letting people access/correct their info

    - Not using data for purposes beyond what it was collected for

  - Applies to most businesses with annual revenue over $3M AUD, plus all health service providers and government agencies

  - Enforced by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)

  

  In plain English: "Handle people's personal data responsibly and legally according to Australian law."
