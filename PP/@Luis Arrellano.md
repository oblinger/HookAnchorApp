# MEETINGS

- SLACK -- at google you should be able to "sneak" 3-hours per day in to your schedule of your non-work project.  (felt this was a stretch as he said it, but he did claim it)
- ADVICE:
	- DO STARTUP -- don't do google.  Do your start up idea instead.
	- QUICKLY ASSESS -- don't spend 100K on a prototype.  Find easier way to test BOTH ideas first
- SWE -- There is only one job ladder I should consider: SWE - Software Engineering
	These are the cool kids, make the most money and decisions.
- TECH INTERVIEW -- is just a check box.  Either you are good enough or not.  No bonus for more
- LEVEL -- SWE L6 is most likely level for hiring, but L7 is also possible.
	An L7 can report to an L7, so its mostly about your hiring manager thinking your are amazing
- Director is L8.
- PAY -- L8 ~550.  his guess L8 ~ 625 for SWE.  
	but he knew an MIT eng that got $800+ for L5 ???
- TWO IN BOX -- An L7 SWE TL + L7 TPM form leadership for a project.  (could also have L7 UX)
