  Matt, 
  The opportunity to work with Michael is likely the most unique opportunity I have ever seen, maybe ever.  My interest would entirely hinge on exactly what Michael is attempting to achieve.  If possible I would love our first conversation to be a rather informal one, just to gauge if I might be a good fit for this role, and whether this role might be a good fit for me.  Regardless of what we find, I am sure the connection will be a interesting one, so I am very happy to meet over coffee to learn more.
  
  I don't have an up to date resume, though I am happy to get it up to date and gather relevant materials if we decide a match is possible.  In the mean time, my linked in is pretty close so I will include that.
  
  As this position is quite specific, I think it will save us both time if I layout the ways I do and do not seem to match what I think you are looking for:

  LANGUAGES
- I _**love**_ language design!  Trying to formulate the obvious commonalities spanning modern languages into a single uniform "Ur" langauge has been a passion project for many years.
- In grad school I spent a year focused on formal languages and the building axomic and denotational theories for parallel programming.
- I am a lifelong lisp hacker, this is a beautiful ecosystem where one can invent programming paradigms easily using the meta-object-protocol or simply via funky load time macros.
- I deeply understand the practical memory-layout & code consequences of languages choices.  (e.g. different tradeoffs w/ different implementations of persistence multiple inheritance, or the ways V8 or PyPy compilers performs JIT type analysis to optomize memory layout for objects.)  I enjoy thinking about how to "push the bubble under the carpet" to provide a best approach to some language feature.
  
  
  RELEVANT EXPERIENCES
- At Aeolus Robotics, I was brought in again as a founding CTO.  There I build a team of 60 engineers (40 with very specialized PhDs in various aspects of robotic dexterous manipulation), and delivered a functioning robot into CES within a single year timeframe.  I continued to serve as architect at Aeolus, though the sheer size of the team and our fast growth rate really pulled me increasingly away from the code.  The entire OS was in the many many tens of thoughts of lines of code (likely beyond 100K lines, but I cannot vouch for that with certainty.)
- I co-founded Martian Robotics, where I lead a 13 person engineering team as CTO.  I was also the architect for our Robot OS for an autonomous dexterous robot.
- As a program Manager at DARPA I envisioned, sold, and managed over $200M in R&D prototypes that involved over 500 professors, post docs, grad students and programmers.  Both the Machine Reading program and the Bootstrapped learning programs included >$3M subteam that created the APIs and execution frameworks the teams were required to operate within.  I lead both of these efforts.
  
  
  RELEVANT SKILLS
- Strong ability to lead a teams under time and scope shift pressures
- Strong ability to hire top talent 
  	(even hyper specialists where only dozens exist the world over)
- Strong ability to architect and take stuardship of a deeply technical vision
- Strong ability to ideate with Micheal on language choices...  
  	would be a partner and carrier of a vision (that I believed in).
- Strong ability to roadmap pragmatic paths "spiral" optimally to 
  	(a) reduce key technical risks and (b) gain world mindshare sooner
- Transformation of software engineering via paradigm shift is a life passion.
- Very fast learner of new, abstract, complex ideas.
- Fast tempo in ideation discussions (and LOVE them!)
  
  I have strengths fomenting consensus around deep architectural choices, and designing APIs, rather than spending my hours coding. In my work at Analytics Fire, Aeolus, and Martin, I was the architect that co-developed the APIs and approach constraints these systems were build upon. So I have even more strengths on the CTO than VP of engineering side.
