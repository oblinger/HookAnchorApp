Steve:

Here is a thought that has been rolling around in my head… but I cannot say it in a compelling, concise, and persuasive way.  I think it is a critical thought for this moment in the US, and I have heard many echos of this thought in your writings.

  

If only it could be pulled together into an agenda for America…

  

  

Let me grope in the dark a bit to see if I can provide the gist of the it.

  

  

The left and right agree that racial disparity exists, but disagree on its core causes, and they understand that this disagreement is very destructive.

  

I believe there is a common set of assumptions which you could argue in a way that brings both the left and the right onto a common page.  You would be saying things that offend BOTH the left and the right in explaining these causes, but if done in Steve QJ style, you manage to pull your reader along since you are ALSO offending the other side too.

In the end, you have a framework that is not detailed enough to say which policies are good or bad.  But it is enough of a framework for both the left and the right to acknowledge core claims of the other side, and to agree its all of our problem to solve.

  

I could write alot more, but let me just say the core claims (I am pretty sure they are QJ aligned):

  

  

-1-  Racial disparity exists, and is causes by significant demographic factors (like income etc.), as well as cultural factors both extrinsic (outside the affected group) and intrinsic (inside the group).  Both side agree with much of this claim but will shriek in horror at one or the other of the phrases in the last part of that sentence.  Yet:

  

— many well run studies show that extrinsic factors a pervasive for Blacks in America.  Resumes get follow up less often when they contain a black sounding name. etc.

  

— on the other side strong studies show that children raised out of wedlock have worse outcomes, and Blacks raise children out of wedlock more often their non-blacks.  This has also got to be a factor.

  

Better arguments can be made here… but the aim is to get everybody on board with the idea that both kinds of factors are SIGNIFICANT … no attempt to decide which has greater effect.  We don’t need that, once we see that both are significant, then we all agree that both should be addressed.

  

  

~-~

  

Second core idea:

  

Regardless of which kinds of factors you personally think the biggest cases for racial disparity you must accept that is the responsibility of America as a Nation.  After all the slaves of the past were stripped of any culture they might have inherited from their past.  Their language, culture, traditions, religions, etc. are all 100% American instilled.  So even if you believe it is all “Black cultures” fault.  That culture exists and was created by your nation.  So you nation bears responsibility.  (Notice: I am not arguing for reparations or that any individual today bears responsibility, but I am saying that America AS A NATION created this problem, and so it is up to america AS A NATION to address it.

  

At the same time, if one believes in the freedom of the individual, then we must leave ultimate

Steve, 
This is not exactly a topic... its more of an agenda, but I think it is very close to the way that you view the world, and I think the direction in which you hope it will proceed.

The idea is to frame racial disparity as stemming from significant extrinsic factors (the context of the minority) as well as significant intrinsic factors (like rates of marriage within a culture).  Declaring BOTH kinds of factors as significant will generally piss everyone off, since both sides are convinced that even if theoretically all factors have some weight, it is 99% the "other" factors that matter.  But, the evidence is there to show at least SOME factors on both sides are significant.  The case can be made strongly.

The case can also be made strongly that America as a nation is fully responsible.  Even if one believes that 90% of the factors are due to African American culture, well that culture did not come from Africa.  That was violently stripped away, no 100% of African American culture today stems from experiences (slavery etc.) that have occurred here.  So one must agree we as a nation must "own" this problem, regardless of you in present day, you think needs to change the most.

At the same time, if you believe in free will, and freedom of the individual then you also must accept that each person must own the outcomes of their lives even though we know that each of our human starting points are very different in racial and many non-racial ways too.


In short I am arguing for a unifying world view where present day racial disparities are understood as a result of significant extrinsic and intrinsic causes.  Arguing that, as a nation, we are responsible for the cultures that have grown up within our borders, and thus responsible mitigating the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic factors alike.  Indeed we don't even need to resolve which factors are larger or which subgroup is most a "fault" we must own it all.  In the end we must strive to improve the lot of every person, while respecting the fact that life will never be remotely equivalent for all peoples, yet each person must bear full responsibility for their own outcomes in life if we are to remain a free society.

Sorry ... got wordy there.  I think there is a need for each side in this debate to see there are legitimate claims made by that other, and that none of that matters in the end, since responsibility is upon all of us regardless of the exact break down in causes.

This is a bit more than a topic... it is kind of an agenda, but I think perhaps it could start as a topic.  Let me see if I can lay it out:

- Many Americans are united in a belief that racial division and not seeing a common reality is disastrous problem for America.
- The left and right are quite divided on their assessment of cause, and are divided on what they think are the key things that must change.
- But I think with proper framing and the right voice many could see and accept enough common reality to chart a consensus path forward.  
- My idea is to pair the hard truths for each side with the qualifiers (which will turn out to be the hard truths the other side needs to accept.)




# Uniting American On The Issues Of Racial Fairness and Racial Disparity



Americans largely agree on many aspects of today's racial disparity, they vehemently disagree however on its root causes.  Many see this lack of a consensus view on reality as a disastrous cancer invading all aspects of our society.

Here we argue for a small collection of claims about race and racial disparity in hopes of building a modest framework that is accepted by both the left and the right.  This framework will still leave much room for society to disagree about the relative weights of various factors, and about which policies are most auspicious.  All we hope is to provide a common way of seeing the issues in a way that allows full ownership by both left and right in fixing the problems.

This article is likely going to PISS YOU OFF at some point.  It will argue for a cause of racial disparity that you reject, because you know the "real" cause for disparity is found elsewhere.  To avoid this I am staying far away from conclusions about which cause it more important, only which causes have significant impact.  This may not be enough for you, you may feel that even acknowledging a lesser cause will let "those other guys" "off the hook,"  So you cannot accept any mention of the lesser cause.  
Just know, when you do this, YOU, not the other side, are the ignoring reality in order maintain a certain world view.

My aim here is to get both sides to grudgingly agree to the significant factors at play, even if they disagree on the relative importance of the factors.  And a second aim it to get agreement on who is "at fault" and who "must change" in order to fix these problems.  Again we will not be trying to assess comparative importance of these factors, just which factors definitely must be considered as relevant.

Without any supporting arguments here are the key conclusions we will arguing for:

1. SIGNIFICANT EXTRINSIC FACTORS DRIVE RACIAL DISPARITY
2. SIGNIFICANT INTRINSIC FACTORS DRIVE RACIAL DISPARITY
3. IN ONE SENSE AMERICA ITSELF IS FULLY AT FAULT.  
    America as a people and nation is the cause the white / black disparity in the United States today.
4. IN ANOTHER IMPORTANT SENSE EACH INDIVIDUAL IS FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FATE.
    Ultimate responsibility for the outcome of each person's life rests solely with that person.  Each person's gifts, liabilities, and context are as unique as their fingerprint, and each is dramatically harder or easier than many others in many ways.


Key Conclusions
- BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT OFT USE THE SAME ARGUMENT TYPE TO DENY REALITY
