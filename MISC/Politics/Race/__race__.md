## White Fragility

Consider this annoying claim:  ``Blacks have more babies outside of marriage, and studies show adults from single parent homes are poorer.  This is why Blacks are so financially screwed up."

Jeremy, how do you feel about that statement?  

We both agree that NOT ALL blacks are born out of wedlock, and parental marital status is not the ONLY factor affecting financial outcomes.  But according to you it is ok if I loudly make that statement above and don't mention these important qualifications... all is good since both of the effects listed above are definitely true.

And here is the even more infuriating second half:  "If any Black does take issue with this statement above we know why, it is because they are Fragile." Our speaker continues to explain,  "many Blacks have a deep seated insecurity, we can see this because they react so strongly when we present these two simple facts that even they agree are true!"   



~ ~ ~

To be clear, I do NOT support the statements above.  And I am not arguing that they are 100% parallel to cases where whites are attacked as a group w/o adding any qualifiers.  BUT both are examples of the same kind of logical fallacy (essentializing), and I think this example demonstrates two things:


-1- When there are important qualifiers that are ignored, it can invalidate an entire story/argument -- when this happens it is important for someone to call attention to the missing qualifiers.

-2- Setting a person up in a situation they are presumed guilty, and then treating any attempt at discussion or defense by the person as further proof of their guilt is a cheap power play, and it is annoying as fuck.


Let's try to undestand what is so gauling about the statement at the top.  Is it that the Black listener deep down knows it is right? NO! not at all!  It is the inherent unfairness of the situation.  Reducing all ills suffered by black down to their marital status is massively unfair.  Then claiming that any reply from them just proves that deep down they know we are right.  Holy living fucking hell that would be annoying!  and unjust.



So let's just agree, it is MASSIVELY uncool to throw around over generalizations of other peoples.

And it is a massively uncool power play to further call them fragile when they attempt to add the qualifier that you should have added in the first place.




~ ~~

Now all this said, 
- I DO believe that, as part of the majority, I really don't "get" what it is like to be a minority---very likely I don't get it, in really important ways.  
- I DO believe that more listening and understand by the majority is critical, and still it is not happening as it needs to happen.  
- I DO accept that I and society at large need to do more, since the problems of racism is still with us, and is still very damaging to far too many people.



I am just sure that throwing around generalities is NOT a constructive path, and I am sure it causes LESS listening to happen.  Labeling a legitimate complaint as Fragility is giving the very people you hope to influence a legitimate excuse to ignore you---and we all are often looking for excuses to ignore difficult truths, so why provide that excuse?






## Steve QJ - Framing of the race debates

Steve, 
I propose the following framework as a way to think about the issues around Race in America.  I think it has advantages of being: accurate, consensus building, and actionable.  Below are the bare-bones of the core argument, separately one would need to think about how it might be packaged for different audiences.  For now, I am soliciting your thoughts on the framing:

BACKGROUND CLAIMS:
- 100% AMERICA'S "FAULT" -- Many have arguments about why this group or that group is responsible for the present conditions of Blacks in America.  Without weighing in on any of these one way or another, it seems that we can all agree the fault lies somewhere within America the nation.  Its present and past policies, peoples, and cultures somehow have come together to result in our present state of affairs.
	- Which sub groups, policies, and cultures are MOST at fault is quite a contention topic, we are not likely to reach consensus on this.  
	- Still we can agree that that American historical actions which includes the brutal policies of slavery, as well as the many subcultural behaviors of today are all part of that mix.
	- African American culture today itself owes relatively little to the African cultures of our ancestors, these were ripped forcefully away by slavery, and replaced with a culture that grew over time 100% here in America. 


## Affirmative Access
### the power network

**CAPS GRAPH** -- The _**caps graph**_ is a graph of capabilities (skills, abilities, experiences, roles, titles, certifications, etc) that are required or preferred for other downstream caps and finally to social influence and economic wealth.

**ACCESS** -- Given an activity that could enable a person to acquire some new capability, a person is said to have _**access**_ to that opportunity if their existing capabilities allow them to perform the activity, and they were fairly considered for that activity.

**TRACTION** -- The traction for a given population on a given capability is the ratio of the prevalance of that population having some cap to the prevelance of that population having the requisite antecedent caps.

ANTECEDENT SCORE -- 

ANTECEDENT CAP WEIGHTINGS -- within the population the conditional prob that a person with access get a cap given they have the given antecedent cap

ACCESSIBILITY -- The accessibility of a given capability for a given population is the ratio of its access relative to its size

### note to steve

A friend and colleague is a PhD in a big fintech, and approached me about doing network analysis of the effect of unconscious or low grade racism within a corporation.  (my background is Machine Learning and hers is social network analysis).  Her idea is to convey the idea that the cumulative effect of differential access (to friend networks, mentoring, internships) can be a powerful form of racism.

So I made up the word affirmative access, but really the idea came from the early stages of that work (we STILL don't have the NDAs nor funding secured so that work may remain a pipe dream).  But either way, I have become quite a believer in the idea.




For me it is a big "ah hah" to realize that fixing differential access with "unfair" extra minority access, is so much more palatable to all involved, than affirmative action... and if it were executed systematically at all levels in the education stack, it could be more impactful, since in the end.  It would result in capable minorities that were then winning jobs and promotions on merit alone.




One could even completely remove color from the program entirely, but simply capturing stats on all subgroups of any type (racial, geographic, economic, etc.)  And then provide extra access...  (just an extra chance to be considered on merit alone... but dont systematically at all levels).  My guess is this would be a HUGE boost to the most motivated & capable...  and layer after layer they compete on merit alone to get to the next level.




I think a program like this especially stripped of specific color bias could be acceptable to liberals and conservatives alike since it is based on merit, and since it affords benefit to any subgroup that statistically is under-represented within an area.

## Weak Men Are Superweapons
https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Weak-Men-Are-Superweapons

## Why vote right?

-- The gov spends too much money, and the left wants to spend even more of it on things that dont help me,
	don't help those who earned it, don't help those who deserve it.

-- The left wants to impose its world view and its values on me and on America.

## Gas lighting by the left

The left's gas lighting of America


Both the left and right in America today have a strong agenda, but as one in the middle is seems that the left is a bit disingenous (even to itself) about its own agenda.

Most Americans would agree that a person's level of success results from a combination of the individual's:
(1) internal factors (Personal proclivities)
(2) Opportunties available to the individual (e.g. parents income, etc.)
(3) Societal reaction (how others treat them)

It is plausible that if a person were very lazy by nature they might prefer to emphasize #2 (opportunities available) over #1 (personal proclivities) as the primary cause for different people's success.  Still it is a logical fallacy to conclude anyone arguing for #2 is lazy by nature and that is why they have this opinion.  It does not logically follow and it is just wrong thinking.


Symmetrically, it is a logical fallacy and wrong to say a person emphasizing internal factors over external factors is doing so because they are racist or privileged.  There is good experimental evidence showing that all people are quite affected by race and in this way all are racist.  Still it does not follow that the reason for their belief comes from their racism or priveledge.  This is also a logical fallacy and is wrong thinking.  Still I personally suspect there is a bit or alot of racism and privlege behind the conservative emphasis.  In this way I am on the same page with my leftie friends.  But I further see significant evidence for a second much purer reason for the conservative emphasis:

Belief in hard work.  The belief that each individual is the captain of their own ship, and that much of their success/failure in life comes from choices that they as individuals make and have made over the course of their lifetimes.


Stated in this way many liberals would agree with it.  But in practice the left does not acknowledge or act on this belief.  It is quite common for liberal publication to explain a negative groupt outcome purely in terms of external factors (racism or priveledge).  Further is quite common to label any internal-factors explanation of those same outcomes as racist and priveldged.

Indeed the left's thinking is quite hegemonic on this point.

It is not enough that one acknowldges that external factors like racism or priveldge are important, one STILL may not say that internal factors are ALSO systematically important.


A bit surprisingly for me, I find conservative thought a bit more open minded than liberal thought on this point:

Many conservatives would be happy saying:  
   while differences in work ethic and personal values cause most differences between groups, racism and priveledge remain important contributors

But few liberals would be happy saying:
   while racism and priveledge cause most differences between groups, differences in work ethic and personal values remain important contributors


Any suggestion that some internal factor is an important cause of a group's troubles will swiftly be labelled as: fragility, racist, privleged, or alt-right.  The condemnation is swift, harsh, and brutal.


Hence the gaslighting of America.


At one level most all accept both internal and external factor explanations as important, yet at a societal level we attempt to weld rose colored glasses onto our thinking and discourse.  We confuse what we WANT to be true with that which we OBSERVE to be true.  We think by controlling thought we might hope to control reality.


I believe this approach is misguided.  I believe this approach actually CREATES its own backlash.
It seems to me, most of the core aims of the left are quite supported by most members on the right.

But in denying the truth of a reality they see with their own eyes, the left looses those members on the right.
Then systematically apply the worst explanation for the right's thinking (racist/priveldged) as as the core and only explanation for that thinking.

Suggesting that some group has 





 most conservatives more open minding than most liberal












Critically many on the right will continue to explain personal outcomes as coming from the individual even when that person is of the same race as they are, and even when they themselves did not come from privledge.  There is no racial or priveldge reason for them holding this opinion...  but they often do.  I pers

Hehe, I am not as sanguine as you guys are on this point.

I think as long as there are differences between two groups where the smaller group is performing worse than the larger group there will always be suspicion of foul play.
Of course in the present world there IS foul play, but even if theoretically if we completely remove all of that foul play, and still somehow a performance difference remains, then there will still be an expectation of foul play.

Only if all people can unambiguously and transparently see the cause of a difference could they accept that difference without blame.  But with complex human issues true cause will never be clear.
Thus the disadvantaged minority-group will always choose a non-implicating explanation, while the advantaged majority-group will always choose the explanation that avoids implicating them.
Notice this structure will exist regardless of the actual underlying causation.  This structure will exist anytime a minority underperforms, the majority and minority groups will blame each other.

The only way it can disappear is if there become no performance differences between the groups.
(And even then, beliefs within the population will keep the differences alive for some time.)


While the following two pieces of info are not conclusive, but don’t bode well for a fade away scenerio.  Even if this one cultural difference were the only internal cultural difference between the groups it seems it would be enough to maintain a notable difference in outcome. (I included references below) here are two relevant quotes:
    #1. ``Among solo parents, 42% are white and 28% are black, ‘’   [ in population 72% are white while 13.4% are black ].   28/42  /  13.4/72.  =   x 3.58 time more likely a black parent is solo relative to prevalence in population.
    #2. ``Children of single mom’s are relatively likely to become low-income adults ‘’

As long as the African American population has a 3.58x rate of solo parenting, they will have difficulty maintaining a strong standard of living while child rearing.



(NOTICE:  All distinct features of the African American population stem from their history here in America, specifically a history of discrimination and slavery.  Thus America is 100% to blame for all aspects of African American culture and population circumstance, so I am not trying to dodge the blame bullet here… this is America’s original sin, we must own it forever.  But it's not a matter of blame, no matter how it got into that population seems it is in there now and having great effect.  And until it is gone, it seems the performance delta might not be gone either.  Further, family money isn’t the obvious fix, after all lack of money should be pushing couples together in order to live a higher standard of living.  NOTICE #2:  Black Africans that come to America do not share the solo child rearing rates that African American’s natives do, so whatever the ultimate causes it does not seem superficially contained in the way that blacks are perceived/treated by non-blacks.)



And of course systematic racism ALSO seems quite likely in the short run to be causing a lot of differences too… so at least there is hope things can improve somewhat… and of course populations can change too, indeed the African American population did not feature this huge split-family feature until relatively recently.

Not so facetiously, I suspect there will always be some sort of criteria where someone (or something) feels their opportunities or rights are not as "equal" as others.  If it takes a century to get there for humans at some level (and not have sexist, age-ist, racial, or national origin issues) we may have to deal with transferred consciousnesses or real AI 'bots by then vying for positions in academia or maybe genetically modified non-humans.

## white & black

Not even one clap!
Quite sad.  Your narrative does not fit with the stories told by conservative or liberal, by white or by black... so it is not read, it is not really considered.
Seems to me the honest response is to say ``yes there is good reason for many of those stereotypes.''  knowing this could (perhaps?) lessen the blow when such a stereotype is leveled against you.
But it also seems the honest response would be to acknowledge that the culture out of which those stereo types grew is built entirely in reaction to a larger society pushing them there.
Also as a white dude, I think it is quite impossible for me to really wrap my head around what it must be like, to forever be on the receiving end of a stereo type that I never did ANYTHING to create or to propagate.

now if only one could get all blacks to really see the truth of first paragraph here and get all whites to see the truth of the last two... we would be getting somewhere!

Any ideas?
## === TRUTHS ===

- NO HIGHER GROUND -- Just because from your vantage you can explain-away and invalidate another's perspective, does not mean that they do not also have a vantage that invalidates your.
	==> Not arguing that all is relative, and nothing can be concluded.
	==> Rather arguing that must not dismiss another's perspective w/o first deeply understanding it.

- GRAIN -- Any significant belief held by a sizable fraction of humanity likely has more than a grain of truth.  Likely there is an important truth in it that you can learn from.


- DOMINANT CULTURE IS NOT "WHITE"
- AA culture is really

### STRONG GENERALITIES
- VARIATION -- Both Whites and Blacks 
- GENERALITIES -- That said, taken as a whole, these groups are notably different.  More statistically significant differences can be found than say July and January babies, or Ohio and Arizona citizens.

### RACISM STEMS FROM IDENTITY

Strong racial identity CAUSES strong racism.
One cannot erase racism without erasing racial identity.
To an extent one can constrain behavior, but racism is a matter of the heart,
and the heart is driven by identity.

Thus we can persue two different paths:
- The erasure of racism thru the erasure of racial identity.
- The minimization of effects of strong racism via laws and social norms.

Both are viable, but we should not kid ourselves if we foster strong racial identities we ARE fostering strong racism; which them must be countered with pervasive and vigelantly monitored laws and social normals.

You can cage a lion and feed her vegetables, but make no mistake about it, you leave the door unlocked one day and years of carrots will not have changed her nature.

- INATE COMPETITIVE DRIVE -- connected to inherent limitation on resources.
- INATE TRIBAL DRIVE -- connected to prisoners dilemma of cooperation+competition
- INATE CIVILITY DRIVE -- connected to prisoners dilemma from tribalism
	Humans are inately driven by fairness, justice, and retribution.
	Groups of many tribes can accept upon themselves some "rule of law" that constrains their behavior.  This rule is held in place by innate human drives towards fairness, justice, and retribution.  The group as a whole maintains the rule, thru "selfless" action in service of fairness, justice, and retribution.  Essentially we desire to defeats those who would break the rule even when it does not affect us.

“Do you know that Negroes are 10 percent of the population of St. Louis and are responsible for 58% of its crimes? We’ve got to face that. And we’ve got to do something about our moral standards,” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told a congregation in 1961. “We know that there are many things wrong in the white world, but there are many things wrong in the black world, too. We can’t keep on blaming the white man. There are things we must do for ourselves.”

Liberals in general, and the black left in particular, like the idea of talking about racial problems, but in practice they typically ignore the most relevant aspects of any such discussion. Any candid debate on race and criminality in this country would have to start with the fact that blacks commit an astoundingly disproportionate number of crimes. African-Americans constitute about 13% of the population, yet between 1976 and 2005 blacks committed more than half of all murders in the U.S. The black arrest rate for most offenses—including robbery, aggravated assault and property crimes—is typically two to three times their representation in the population.

# ### TOPICS ###
## === AGENDA ===

_**Basic message**: It is so common for people to have an agenda, you should just assume that you DO have these agendas.  You should identify what they are, and then look for how these agendas blind you to certain realities that others see._



**AGENDA** -- An _**agenda**_ is generalized conclusion that is sought by an individual prior to collecting any information about specific cases.

An agenda may be based on prior information or experience, but is not generally accepted by all others as a justified generalization based on that experience.

- **GRADATIONS** -- An agenda can be a slight bias/preference for a kind of conclusion, or it can be a rabid universal conclusion forcible pushed regardless of any evidence.
- **EXTREMELY COMMON** -- Each person tends to have many different agendas of differing strength.
- **TIED TO IDENTITY GROUPS** -- Often tied/coorelated with the groups that form a person's identity in both directions.  The groups will have agendas aimed at protecting its own reputation, and having a specific agenda will cause one to identify with others with the same agenda.
- **NOT AUTOMATIC** -- Especially for identity groups based uncontrollable attributes (like skin color or nationality) one cannot assume that all members of that group share an agenda that is common within that group.
- **POPULATION RELATIVE** -- We have no way to measure agenda except relative to conclusions that others in the population draw, or relative to conclusions made after deeper reflection.  e.g. you have an agenda if you consistently conclude differently than others, or if you conclude differently than after deeper consideration/exploration.


**EXAMPLES OF COMMON AGENDAS**

- **SELF REPUTATION PERSERVATION** -- Most people have an agenda to protect their own reputation.  Before any specifics info is known about any specific incident we can guess that they will tend to explain their own actions as justified/correct/moral given the circumstances more often than others will see their actions as justified/correct/moral.
	- Some have this agenda in a loose way -- willing to admit incorrect acts, while others can be quite rabbid in defending their actions in all contexts.
	
- **GROUP DENIGRATOR** -- Some people have come to generalized conclusions about a specific race that is not generally shared.  ?? They tend to conclude negative things about the group quickly, and then may have to walk them backwards as others push against these conclusions.

- **GROUP EQUALIZER** -- Others have an opposite agenda.  They tend to assume different outcomes for different groups are due to external rather than internal factors for that group.  They tend to 

- **KARMA COPS** -- These folks tend to look at internal factors within a group when trying to explain differences between groups.

Notice:  Those on the left tend to be equalizers, while those on the right tend to be karma cops.

Introspective sorts on the left, will admit this is true, but will assert their agenda is for the greater good.
Introspective sorts on the right will admit this is true, but will assert their agenda is based in a reality that the left wants to deny.

### --- 2020.07.21 - Factor Analysis - internal / external factors

Oh the factors are hoplessly tangled from one generation to the next, and one moment to the next.

Thus I agree that playing the blame game makes no sense.  Early America is responsible for slavery.  Slavery is responsible for African American culture today, and racist beliefs today.
Therefore America itself is nearly 100% responsible.  So I am not TRYING to untangle the “original” causes of anything.

But I want to treat each of these causes as a counter factual that I might change tomorrow, and then I want to know the effect of changing that one factor.

So I will give two some tautologically clear internal and external factors:

Internal Factor:  A black woman’s belief that Racism exists, and it will prevent him from having a fair shot in the job market (so she won’t even try)
External Factor:  A white woman’s racist prejudgement that a black man will not be suitable for a job (so she doesn’t hire her)

Internal Factor:  Crimes committed by blacks.
External Factor:  Belief that blacks commit more crime.


~ ~~ ~
So separating internal and external factors is not hard.  Causal factors are ... CAUSAL this means you know where they originate from, thus you know where they reside.
What is HARDER is to measure the relative effect of internal and external factors on an outcome.  When each one is the cause of the other.

Hard but not impossible.  For example for the first pair of factors, I would want to find a tiny subgroup within the black population that have a context that is absolutely ideal as possible and see if their outcomes are still notably different from a white person in a similar context, if so I know that external-factor racism is at work.
If I see that their outcome is very similar to the white person’s outcome then I see that external factor racism is not large relative to the internal factors that we corrected for.


Essentially one can do a factor analysis on the system, and learn which levers have the largest effect to fix the system.  THIS IS WHAT I PROPOSE.


But to follow the agenda I propose one would need to explicitly list and measure some factors that others would use to “blame” blacks.
I would not do this, nor do I condone this, but others WOULD do this.  So liberals are squeamish about explicitly naming and measuring these factors.


Indeed the liberal narrative generally make the implicitly assumption that 100% of the cause of the negative outcome stems exclusively from external factors.


"When will women make a buck?" (comparing ratio of pay by gender and implicitly assuming that any difference seen indicate gender bias in society)
Even Leslie’s connection of “1 in 3 blacks are felons” and evidence of "new Jim Crow” has that flavor.

(Not picking on you here Leslie) this kind of thinking is deeply embedded in left thinking.  Being a felon (most) requires committing a felony as a causal antecedent.
This is an INTERNAL factor, which of course is likely tied to many external factors.  But notice strong training we have given ourselves to jump over that internal factor.


But we are ultimately not helping anyone with this approach.  We cannot fix a problem if a whole category of critical causes are ignored.
Unfortunately most who rail against this gap in logic above are not INTERESTED in helping, actually they DO want to just blame the blacks.

So this hard hitting kind of analysis goes undone, and the problem remains.


(And of course overt racism and other external factors ALSO excerbate things too, but at least we have 20+ years of attempting to study and mitigate those factors… and we have some progress too.)

~ ~~ ~ ~

And of course if I tried to put this in my facbook feed, or publish it on medium… my house would get burnt down…. Or at least my good SF citizen sticker would get removed.

Just a quick comment on the culture and slavery and original sin question.  I think I would somewhat agree with Dan and a difference that is overlooked is that the majority of immigrants to America came VOLUNTARILY and, in a sense, transported their culture with them from Europe or Asia, which over a few generations stood them in very good stead to make progress in a country that (somewhat*) was based on individual human effort being rewarded rather than your birth lineage.  I would argue that most enslaved peoples brought over to the Americas or other lands had their culture/language/even birth names completely stripped from them and that "stripping" has been going on systematically even after emancipation under Jim Crow and other legal structures built to suppress people of color (housing is a good example).

I was very struck by a comment in an interview being replayed over the weekend with John Lewis that he could not even borrow books from the library when he was a teenager [1].  It reminded me of comments when we were growing up in South Africa by people in the government at the time that Black Education only needed to teach black South Africans to be servants and menial workers and anything more was unwise at best and dangerous at worst. 

This distinct destruction of culture and heritage was also brought home to me by a Black American roommate when I stayed at a friend's place for a few months in graduate school.  He was working for Bell Labs/Lucent at the time and talked about how people at work at lunch one day were recounting their family histories and how they came to be in America (a lot where recent immigrants) and how his family came from slaves going back just a few generations.  There was a palpable difference in how he viewed his heritage compared to how I and my other, mostly European, colleagues saw themselves.

I would agree with Dan that non-Black America can do little to repair that damage directly, but all the stripping effects have to cease whether economically, in health care, in education, or in policing, to allow self-healing and cultural regeneration to take place.  When 1 in 3 black men have some sort of felony criminal record and that this rate has more than doubled in the last 30 years, there is a long way to go to dismantle the new Jim Crow style institutions.

Leslie:

Love the perspective it all resonates with me.  Particularly the phrase:
but all the stripping effects have to cease whether economically, in health care, in education, or in policing, to allow self-healing and cultural regeneration to take place.


But you followed it with one that I have hear before, but have always been suspicious of:
When 1 in 3 black men have some sort of felony criminal record and that this rate has more than doubled in the last 30 years, there is a long way to go to dismantle the new Jim Crow style institutions.

I do think there is a new Jim Crow, I do think punishment for crimes are racially skewed.  (e.g. harsh sentencing for crack cocaine). So no disagreeing with that part.  BUT


It dodges the elephant in the room:  ``1 and 3 black men have committed felonies’’. WOW, wow, wow!  No way 1/3 of other races have that level.  Not even in the poorest segment of other races.
So I feel as a society we just don’t want to say the obvious out loud:

There is a large Af Am subculture that strongly correlates with crime.

Jim Crow didn’t do that … some black dude did it!


~ ~~
Now it might sound like I am gearing up to drop the blame on that community.
Not really…. I but **DO** want to force us to face an fact that does not fit the liberal narrative:
      Different cultures do have different outcomes, sometimes negative outcomes.


Once that is accepted it clears the way to asking WHY is the culture this way?
Understanding is the first step towards fixing….  (Again it must come from within so I am just gabbing here)

_
### --- 2020.07.21 - factors for race

Ok, here Dan is just winging it.  I don’t have data for this, just a feeling after 30 years of watching:


(1) VICTIMHOOD CULTURE


(1a). AN IDENTITY TIED TO BEING THE OPPRESSED
Imagine growing up as a lower class living in a society that is mostly defined by an upper class.  Some members of your class “make good” by gaining ground within that society, and others not.
You would have a love/hate relation with the whole society.  On the one hand at a practical level you want to get ahead, and provide for your family, but on the other hand you really just want to BURN THE WHOLE THING DOWN.  It is just evil, and any time you can seriptitiously drop a wrench in the gears just to fuck with it, you would want to do it.

Indeed even John Lewis’ story is one of causing trouble “in a good way” as he says.  Now he is talking specifically about attacking racial rules (which I applaud).  But think about it, to a Black kid in a poor disadvantaged neighborhood, EVERYTHING about the larger white world could easily appear worthy of burning down.  ALL of it is against him/her and his/her people!

==> Viewing society as the enemy is not going to help you to aspire to rise within it.  You aspire to TEAR IT DOWN!  You wear your pants below your underwear and your cap on backwards… ``I am not like you and I dont WANT to be like you.''



(1b).  ITS ALL BECAUSE OF RACISM
In some ways it feels good to ascribe most negative outcomes for minorities to racism because then it is not our/their fault, and all cultures are good.  But this is a very very dis-empowering belief.

Imagine things suck for you, and the reason for this is an external factor outside of your control (racism).
Now imagine things suck for you, but the reason for this is an internal factor inside of your control (your own culture).

Now the latter would be a tough pill to swallow, but it would be an EMPOWERING pill.  It would make you want to create a newer better culture to rise above that culture and win.
While the former is mostly an unassailable mountain.  You as an individual have massive direct control over your personal culture, while you as an individual have almost no control over societal norms.

Many studies have documented that belief is a very strong driver of success.  If you believe you can/cannot do a thing you will be more/less likely to succeed in doing it.  
It make sense, why throw your full effort into a thing that is likely to fail anyway?  Think about how belief in Racism (independent of the existence of Racism) affects a Black kid/adult.  If the game is rigged against you, why try so hard?  You won’t win anyway.



(2)  INSECURITY
A friend once teased that any discipline that adds the word “science” to its name it really (political science, social science, computer science) is secretly a bit insecure about being taken seriously as a discipline and so is compensating, while the “real” disciplines like physics, mathematics, or economics need no artifice.  In this way I see all this talk of black power, thug life, aggrandizing violence in just this way.  Compensation against self-perceived weakness.  But any such perception focus energies towards building such power and away from ultimately more societally-productive pursuits.

I see young black men being very very focused on having, maximizing, displaying, and idolizing power.

This does not engender the steady-Freddy persuit of better grades in math.
It results in a hyper focus on appearances.



(3) NOTHING TO LOOSE SO ROLL THE DICE
If one is making steady progress towards a good outcome, one is motivated to not rock the boat, and to instead simply maintain steady effort.
On the other hand if one is adrift without a real sense of progress, nor clear good end goal in sight.  Then it is time to rock the boat and flip it over.
A couple African American friends (and some Milennials) I know seem to fit this picture.  They see their likely futures in milquetoast terms.
With nothing to loose, why NOT do something random, maybe it will be better.




(4) MASSIVE CHIP ON SHOULDER
A natural consequence of having the world crap on you, and perceiving the world as having crapped upon you, is to feel entitled.
To feel you have not gotten your fair share and that the world owes you something.

I notice that poor whites, poor hispanics, and poor asians, know that they are poor, so do seem to feel that life is not even.
Still I see much less of a sense that the world has specifically singled them out and treated them unfairly as compared too some Blacks I have seen.
This groups feels massively unfairly treated, and will loudly tell you so.  Of course it is unfairly treated.  But so are these other groups.
Not in exactly the same ways.  I certainly do agree the poor white dude is still white.  I grant this is true.
But both Asian and Hispanics have seen quite a bit of negative bias against them.

But I see much less of a “you owe me” mentality in these groups.  And lack of that mentality allows those groups to progress.
(Hispanics have a different pair of cultural items that harm their progress, but at least probably make them happier… but that is for another email)





Anyway.  Dan is winging it here.  These are the qualitative internal factors that I see at play.
It is very important to learn if in-fact I am right, because they are very changable… MORE changeable than racism.

After all changing racism is to get an ENTIRE GROUP that is not harmed by a thing to changed in order to save a person they don’t identify with.
Changing INTERNAL factors, on the other hand, can occur at a small group level, and the changes made directly benefit the person making the changes!




So to sum up Mark I disagree:  we NEED to all get clear on the INTERNAL causes of these negative outcomes, since mere understanding and acceptance of this category of cause is already a huge step in fixing them.  The rest is up to the individual.

But the longer we deflect always towards Racism as the sole and central evil causing these outcomes, the individuals in these group never need to do the soul searching required for action.


(Yeah, if I wrote this shit on Medium, my house would be burned down)

https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/06/19/what-does-defund-the-police-mean-and-does-it-have-merit/

My thinking on this has already shifted.  As I say I think the police are in a no-win situation, so the only solution is to put a group the draws it legitimacy from the group being policed into that no-win situation.

Making this work will be tricky.  Essentially we want the first responder for cases that are likely to be African American to be this special group drawing its legitimacy from that group.

But this is going very tough to make work in practice.   And does each minority group get its own first responders?

Also the larger population will not be happy if those first responders are not resolving the issue itself.



Still the reason my ideas have shifted, is just the recognition that for certain sub-groups the cops really are the enemy.  And it is just unworkable to be policed by your enemy.


I will read this piece with interest.



Indeed I think the police are in a no-win situation.  They cannot drive mistakes down to zero.  But Floyd George shows us that they must drive mistakes to zero.

Certainly the police are in a very difficult situation. But requiring no mistakes is only the view of a small number of activists. I think most of the public would be satisfied if the number of police mistakes was steadily decreasing.

I think the statistics are pretty clear, things ARE trending downward and have been for more than a decade.  But it is too late.  The police are the enemy of many, and humans are very bad at statistics.  So ANY cases of gross injustice are viewed as business as usual.

Since there is no way to police w/o zero gross injustices, we are at a dead end.


  
Again I say it:
Slavery is the original sin, the sin so great that this country can never overcome it.  Very sad.

What about other countries who also had slavery? Haven't some of them done much better then USA?
What do you think of the argument that housing policy is culpable? See https://www.c-span.org/video/?428341-1/the-color-law


It is definitely part of the picture.  When touring SF my guide took me thru part that was the old china town.  It is the mostly densely packed part of the city.  Buildings are grand-fathered into allowance to violate many housing rules.  The apartments are <200 sq ft in many cases!!!

This is because before WWII it was illegal for asians to own anywhere EXCEPT in these few blocks in the city!!!  WOW.
And the effect still exists in a strong way today.  So I think these kinds of effects are real, and have lasting big effects.


But notice Asians are not a group that today we view as systematically oppressed in the same way some see Blacks.

Why is that?
Well Asian Americans are out performing caucasians scholastically as a group for one thing.

Any why is that?
Culture.  It is not that they have some secret old boys network giving them all the advantages.  No they still have some disadvantages in fact.  But their culture is stronger.


And this is the truth that we (mostly liberals) don't want to say out loud in 2020:


-1- Culture has MASSIVE, MASSIVE, MASSIVE impact on outcome.
-2- Certain groups, sometimes partially circumscribed by race, are basically a failed culture — a culture that destines its children to dramatically underperform in many (most) metrics of social success.


That is not to say that racism and racial bias such isn’t a big deal. It is still is a massive deal.

But culture is a BIGGER deal.  The evidence is simple:  We can identify affluent, nuclear-family, educated blacks whose children statistically will perform similar to those of other groups.
This is the effect of CULTURE.  If RACISM >> CULTURE as a cause, this should not be true.

Poor asians becoming rich asians after two generations of being here is not because they were not marginalized… THEY WERE.  But culture dominates racism.



The reason I call Slavery our original sin is because we ARE GUILTY, and it DID and DOES have massive impact.

But so does culture.  And fixing one w/o fixing the other will fix nothing.  Yet we are guilty of slavery, so we will be forever blamed for an outcome that will never change without massive cultural change.
But even admitting to this fact is not a thing we can do as a society.  And changing someones culture is not even permissible as a goal for society.  That much come from within the group.


So we are fucked.  We are guilty.  And we are powerless to address a massive root of the problem:  CULTURE


(I am still in favor of breaking down any and all racial biases that we find.  We still need to do our part to erase the biases that exist.  But with the largest aspect of the problem out of our control, indeed not even on the agenda, and not on a good trajectory.  We just are fucked.)


… America’s original sin…. 



~ ~~ ~

Btw you say that other countries have handle slavery better.  I can agree with that.  But which do you speak of?  In general, I claim the only countries that will not have the problems we do will not have sub-culture that are not as failed as some of ours are.


Of course my perspective begs the question.  WHY are certain US cultures failed?  I am confused about this.  But I do have one insight.


Think of the top 100 most famous, most well known, most obviously “successful”:  whites, asians, blacks, jews, hispanics in America today

Now think of them as role models for each group.  Think of them as a beacon for each 6 year old of each race to aspire to.

Notice they systematically aim those 6 year olds in VERY VERY different directions.

I am sure culture is not as simple as this… and even these differences can be traced to slavery, so I am not playing the blame game here.
I am just trying to get at the root cause of the differences….

Catching up on email:

Generally I am pretty skeptical of this notion.

Do whites know more about white fragility since that is about them, than others?
Groups want to protect their reputation, and will often do it, by denying truths about their own group.

So I expect that blacks will know more stats than a white would about violence within their community.  Generally True.
Blacks will be better in correctly attributing causes.  Generally false.

We are just too willing to throw truth under the bus if it makes us look bad.

Any community that believes that they would be better off with community-policing has a right to try.

I agree with this.  

Indeed I think the police are in a no-win situation.  They cannot drive mistakes down to zero.  But Floyd George shows us that they must drive mistakes to zero.
And I am sympathetic to the notion that Blacks see the police as an ever present danger … one that could kill them at any moment.

It is very very clear that humans do not understand probability.  So we will inflate the risks of a rare event, and become dulled to the risks of a common one.

So I am skeptical that the blacks will be safer with a softer policing.  But I agree with your idea to let them try.


~ ~~
Indeed I think we need to accept that:
      Martin Luther Kings dream that we will judge not by color of skin, but by character within is DEAD dream...

Blacks and whites view themselves as importantly different.  Thus Blacks do not want to be policed by a force that is controlled by “others”
I understand this.  If you view whites as “others” then you will never accept this situation.

So we should create a policing unit that is managed by a caucus of black leaders.  It will have the mandate to keep the peace, and deputized with the use of force just as the regular police are given.

Now **THAT** group must manage the tradeoff of force vs. restraint.  I think this will cause the African American population to take a hard look at the death in their community from lack of policing vs. stronger policing.  (And I am willing to believe that less death can result, since the population will not view this force as ``others’’ -- they will work productively with this force, not openly against it.)


But in my mind, this issue has shown MLK’s dream for the lie that it is.  Not even the blacks believe in this dream.  (Perhaps it is the white's fault that they do not.  But the fact is, they don’t.)



Again I say it:
Slavery is the original sin, the sin so great that this country can never overcome it.  Very sad.

 But *effective* stuff requires having ideas that will actually provide progress.

When I have heard leaders from the black community during these last few weeks, I have heard a great variety of effective ideas expressed. They have been thinking and writing about these issues for many years. We, meaning most whites (liberal or conservative) have not. We need to listen to their ideas first, before evaluating them.

A week ago, I could not have taken seriously ideas like "defund the police" and "abolish the police". I do now. They are serious ideas, with much research, and detailed policy proposals, behind them.

it is pretty clear…. Less policing will lead to greater Black Death.

A week ago I believed this too. Don't you remember that I pointed out that the racial mix of people who lose their lives at the hands of the police is correlated with crime statistics? I pointed out that the issue is not only a problem of police violence against blacks, with police violence against everybody. But addressing the first problem helps to address the second.

But has become clear to me that many in the black community believe that it's the police presence itself that contributes to the high level of violence in black communities, including  "black-on-black" violence. And they know more about this than you do! Any community that believes that they would be better off with community-policing has a right to try.

Yeah I am with Leslie on this.  Mark asked me if after seeing all of the amazing levels of solidarity and demonstrations if I still believed it would make no difference.

Well I think it will make a difference, primarily in the way that activism around climate change has made (some) changes around climate.
It was not a direct effect, but rather it shaped a whole generation to see the issue as a central issue.

In this way, I think these protests are having a profound effect.

BUT like the occupy movement, they basically have some pretty bone-headed ideas.  Indeed overwhemingly if a black man is killed, it is at the hands of another black citizen.

Distrust of the police is very responsible for these deaths since the black community views “resisting” the cops and not “snitching” as a virtue.

So stuff if going to come from all of this.  But *effective* stuff requires having ideas that will actually provide progress.


Here is an LA times article that loudly touts cop killing are a leading cost of dead for blacks and 2.5 times greater than for whites.
But by their own stats the black man is 30x times more likely to be killed by another citizen.


But no matter, it is pretty clear…. Less policing will lead to greater Black Death.

term limits for supreme court justices (18 years)

Interesting, that's one of recommendations by this guy:
https://www.c-span.org/video/?472337-1/depth-yuval-levin
This is by far the best presentation of the conservative attitude I've ever seen. It also completely refutes any suggestion that right and left are looking at different realities. There's actually much common ground. I agreed with most of what he says.

I don't like the national service idea.  Somewhere been inside me, my libertarian heart is still beating.
Yeah - wasn't crazy about this one, or the mandatory voting idea.  Not voting is just as much part of freedom as voting!  Making it easy to vote however fully support (same day registration or automatic registration, make the voting day a holiday, etc, etc).

Our Common Purpose:  Reinventing American Democracy for the 21st Century
"This publication is the final report of the bipartisan Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship. It includes 31 recommendations to strengthen America’s institutions and civic culture to help a nation in crisis emerge with a more resilient democracy"

Not looked at all the recommendations but some of the top ones mentioned on the news were term limits for supreme court justices (18 years), increase congress headcount by 50, a year of national service for all citizens, mandatory voting and same day registration, ranked choice voting, independent citizen-redistricting commissions.  Only constitutional change was for limiting money in funding elections.

No idea if this will be taken seriously in any arm of the government yet.  We shall see.

I think I agree with everything both of you said. How boring! Just one question to Leslie:
Language accommodation is relatively 
easy in my opinion (we've had long Slack threads on "blacklist-whitelist", "master-slave servers", "male-female connectors").
But how many of these have changed, in practice? 
Takes a concerted effort, I agree, to make some of these changes (and I'd say a fair fraction of my colleagues - mostly white males - are rather skeptical of all this).  I guess I don't believe the actual changing of particular words of phrases is the real issue but the reframing of these discussions so people are aware that there can be negative connotations that get perpetuated essentially through ignorance. 




My concern is something else: what is the most effective way to get the change that most people want? This time might be a unique opportunity, since the black community has the largest level of sympathy from the majority that they ever have had, and, quite possibly, ever will have. It's important that they (and we) don't blow this.

I don't think that accusing people of being racist, fragile, privileged, etc, is the best way to get them to be less racist, fragile, privileged, etc, even if they really are. What I think whites need are clear, specific, actions that we should be supporting or taking. For example, the move to community-policing, which has been, unfortunately, given the idiotic slogan "defund the police", makes a lot of sense.  (A better slogan, quite frankly, would be "defend the police", in the sense that it is in the best interest of police to be relieved of their responsibilities for mentally ill people, homelessness, domestic disputes, tracking down stray pets, etc etc etc.)
Totally agree here.  I'm just rather skeptical we are going to see large significant and meaningful change in the areas that matter.  I think there will be communities that will land up in a slightly better place, and one can hope some of the congressional legislative efforts will help, but I'm doubtful.  All the real issues of race tend to be structural issues in the US (e.g. healthcare, education, consumer finance protection, the current bail system, etc, etc).  I think Bernie identified a ton of the issues and think Warren had actual workable ideas of how to effect change, but all the lessons of the 2008 crash are essentially obliterated and not sure we will see meaningful progress on the rest.  Maybe have to totally give up on the federal level and concentrate locally.

There's a marvelous chapter in Archbishop Tutu's book "God has a Dream", called "God loves your enemies". He talks about the dehumanization of the oppressor, the importance of forgiveness, not only by the oppressor, but, if possible, also by the victim, and the importance of reparations, where feasible. The overriding goal is to restore relationships between communities, not to assign blame. It takes a similar perspective to "White Fragility", and similar pieces, but uses completely different language to make the same points much more effectively.

Require that police pervasively collect citzen interaction data and routinely make it available.

This means for example that all police must be using body cams and must have them recording when interacting with the public.  This data is collected by the FBI and is made available to multiple organizations that enjoy significant popular public support (e.g. Black Lives Matter, the ACLU etc.)
