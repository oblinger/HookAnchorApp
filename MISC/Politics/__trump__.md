But Jobs?!?!    America has lost more jobs during Covid than most any other nation.

And for his first three years of his presidency he massively increase our deficit during a period when the country was already booming.
Sure.  Just spend spend spend…. Things will be great…  until they are not.

Of course you agree with Putin…. He was talking to you.
You say    ``trump is helping the situation’’ 

This is a much longer conversation.  But I think trump is not a good negotiator for America, his aims are small and short term at come at great cost to the long term.  Twenty years from now I think historians will look back on the Trump presidency as a pivotal time in the loss of the USD as a reserve currency,  that is worth tens of TRILLIONS of dollars to the USA.

But look at the number of his own appointees that after working with him have said negative things about his ability to lead.
Those are the people he chose!

#### No meeting with the Russians

- It never happened.
- It happened, but it wasn’t connected to the Russian government.
- They were Russian government, but they just wanted to discuss adoption policy.
- We went in expecting to receive dirt on Hillary Clinton, but the Russians didn’t have it. Any campaign would’ve taken that meeting.


#### Taking money from other govs
 One could also make a decent case that foreign governments funneling money to Trump’s private accounts by spending big at his properties violates the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which would be bribery. But the case for collusion is more ambiguous.


#### Clinton Did it too
