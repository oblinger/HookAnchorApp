### --- ARE YOU INFORMED OR ARE YOU MANAGED?


I have a thought I have been chewing on thought for a bit.   See what you think...


There are two kinds of information sources:
— those that primarily seek to inform you, and
— those that primarily seek to convince you.


It is easy to tell the difference between these two:
— A source intent on informing you will present information in ways that highlight both support and opposition to any simple overarching world view (e.g.  small government is better, left is better, right is better, pro-business pro-union, etc.)
— Imagine a weather channel that is always highlighting the fact that is it not snowing in Dallas.  This might be true, but it's not news.  News is something that goes against what is expected… it is “new”-s
— So any outlet that that frames every story as always supporting or always opposing…… ANYTHING.  Is not primarily a source of news, it is a source of propaganda.  It might be factually accurate propaganda, or not factual, but either way, the aim is clear — it primarily aims to persuade.


I guess there is another possibility.  Perhaps where is a world view so perfect and so complete, it is such a perfect explanation of the world, there are no exceptions or special cases to report on.  Of the hundreds of millions of human interactions each day there simply IS no contrary information worth reporting.  Yeah, and I have the hot tip on how to buy in on this bridge being built...


So here is my maxim:

If you don’t have info sources you trust and listen to which regularly highlight examples that challenge or contradict your core beliefs, you are not informed … you are managed.  

Now of course not everyone really wants to be informed and challenged, I get that.  
Either way, it is just good to know where you stand.




What ya think?

And they were upholding the decision of a fourth Republican, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann, a conservative jurist and Federalist Society member. Brann had called the campaign’s legal case, which was argued in court by Rudy Giuliani, a “haphazard” jumble that resembled “Frankenstein’s monster.”

— U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten in Georgia, an appointee of President George W.

— U.S. Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas, a former law professor appointed by Trump, wrote, “voters, not lawyers, choose the president. Ballots, not briefs, decide elections,” as his panel refused to grant a request to stop Pennsylvania from certifying its results.
