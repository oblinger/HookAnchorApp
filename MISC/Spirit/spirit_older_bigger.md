— if a a cash register contains five five-dollar bills in , and I ask for change for a twenty.
     After you remove four fives and replace them with the twenty, we all agree the cash register no longer contains five five dollar bills.  This is how the physical world, there is nothing more do say about the change in state for the cash register.
— {[Could use example of juke box to make change to world, or contract cash swap that is theft vs one that is not; is served food or not served food 
— But most would agree that this is not "all" that is going on here.
    — in one case a person is getting change, while in the other the person is stealing (intentionally or not).  That this is also going on.

   — But a person from a distant land who is familiar with these secondary meanings for things might with these meanings might insist that "all" that is going on are physical actions.  including the physical actions of hearing music.
— When asked "why" do we hear music in one case, but not it the other case, they explain well elecricity is going thru the wires in the speaker in one case, but not in the other.  We ask why is that, well she talks about the amplifier circute being stimulated differently in the two cases.  We keep asking why, and she keeps explaining further back in the physical chain how these difference are the result of the purely physical world operating according to the laws of physics.
— she is quite adament that there is no evidence that anything beyond the laws of physics is at work here.

— we explain the concept of money and how that explains what is going on.
— she says, ok I see how this relates, and how it is predictive, but this money does not really exist.
~~~~~
— Same argument that WE don't exist.  indeed that consciousness does not exist.
~~~~
— if one claims that consciousness beings exist, and that their consciousness can have effect on the physical world.  Then you believe in a spritual universe:

That sentience
