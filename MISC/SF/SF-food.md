Locanda - Love this place, but no ressies available on Monday.
Mission Chinese Food - Haven't been, but high on my list. They don't take reservations though.
Monk's Kettle - Great beer selection, but they don't take reservations and they are small.
West of Pecos - Tex-Mex. Haven't been.
Commonwealth - Eclectic. Haven't been but would really like to try. I made a 7:45 ressie here if this works for you.
Mission Bowling Club - Really cool bowling alley, restaurant, and bar. I'm an investor here and friends with the 2 main owners, so I'm not taking a first date here. Maybe I can take you there one day : )

Other places you should try:
Frances - Not open Mondays. Awesome food.
Front Porch - Great fried chicken and southern food.
Puerto Allegre - Great sit down Mexican food.
Limon - The chicken is awesome.
500 Club - Great dive bar.
Burrito joints - Have you found a favorite? I like La Taqueria, but it's down on the far end so we hit Pancho Villa or Cancun or El Farolito more often.
Pakwan - Indian food
Rosemunde - Great sausages and beer selection
Phat Philly -Great cheesesteaks.
Cha Cha Cha's - Fun atmosphere for groups.
Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem - Great tater tots and brunch, but pretty bad service.
Outback Steakhouse - Just checking if you're still reading.
