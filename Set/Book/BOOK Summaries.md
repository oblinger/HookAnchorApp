### 2024 "Anthem" by Neil Stephenson

Set on an Earth similar planet in the future after 3 collapses of society.

As a means of controlling knowledge, monasteries are set up where the members are cut of for 1, 10, 100, or 1000 years.

Turns out the 1000 year folks have a way of editing reality using their mind.

Or maybe they move themselves (and us) between alternate universes.


Their ability and the "everything killers" which are very tiny tactical nukes are the cause of these catastrophes, so society (somehow) sequesters the knowledge about these things via a rigid social order.

The majority of society is kind of drugged by a naturally occurring weed "allswell" that makes you feel that all is well.


In the story we find an alien ship in the sky with four races from four variant universes whose particles are subtly different such that they cannot breath each other's oxygen very well.

They have to attack the ship with the help of one of the races on the ship.


### 2024 "Down and Out" by Cory Doctrow

Set in a post scarcity future, where all bodily needs are met w/o the need for cash.
People can live indefinitely by being transferred into a younger body.

Society has evolved a system where the instantaneous joy or frustration that you cause for others is added or deducted from a score that you hold over time.  This score becomes the new kind of money, it is coveted, and it affects your value in society.  At a low enough level you cannot even enter a place, or the car you are using could be taken by another with higher score.

Main character social group wants to maintain a Disney theme park w/o in it original form, while others want to introduce modern emotional enhancements.  Outcomes in society are driven by point scores, so the battle is a kind of popularity contest.


One character plans to end his life, but wants to end with a strong score, so he is building up his points so he can end with dignity.



### 2024 "The Expanse" Series by James S.A. Corey
I loved the society described and the concept of the proto-molecule, but the story had big plot holes that were frustrating.

Begins with _"Leviathan Wakes,"_ this series blends space opera with hard science and complex political and societal themes, focusing on humanity's expansion into space.

Story follows Holder space captain, and Miller ex-Cop chasing Julie
Proto-molecule used to infect whole asteroid as a kind of weapon/tool from aliens

maybe is was intended to wipe out earth, or maybe they launched it when earth did not have advanced life so it was an unintended consequence.

The year is 2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred worlds, interconnected by a web of transport "tunnels" known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the Over one thousand light-years away, a star... vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply disappears. Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the Second Chance, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot whose glory days are centuries behind him.  
  
Opposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that believes the human race is being manipulated by an alien entity they call the Starflyer. Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians, warns of sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship's mission for its own ends.  
  
Pursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced the Guardians are crazy but dangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not averted. Aboard the Second Chance, Kime wonders if his crew has been infiltrated. Soon enough, he will have other worries. A thousand light-years away, something truly incredible is a deadly discovery whose unleashing will threaten to destroy the Commonwealth... and humanity itself.



"Judas Unchained"

The Starflyer, an alien with mind-control abilities impossible to detect or resist, has secretly infiltrated the Commonwealth and is sabotaging the war effort
