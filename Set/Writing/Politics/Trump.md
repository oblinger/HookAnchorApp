**1.** [**His vice president, Mike Pence**](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/08/06/mike-pence-dana-bash-sotu-vpx.cnn): “The American people deserve to know that President _**Trump asked me to put him over my oath to the Constitution**_. … Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States.”

**2.** [**His second attorney general, Bill Barr**](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/politics/bill-barr-trump-arraignment-2020-election/index.html): “Someone who engaged in that kind of bullying about a process that is fundamental to our system and to our self-government _**shouldn’t be anywhere near the Oval Office**_.”

**3.** [**His first secretary of defense, James Mattis**](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/politics/mattis-statement-trump/index.html): “Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people – does not even pretend to try. _**Instead he tries to divide us**_.”

**4.** [**His second secretary of defense, Mark Esper**](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/02/politics/john-kelly-donald-trump-us-service-members-veterans/index.html#:~:text=His%20former%20secretary%20of%20defense,and%20character%20issues%20as%20well.%E2%80%9D): “I think he’s unfit for office. … _**He puts himself before country**_. _His actions are all about him and not about the country_. And then, of course, I believe he has integrity and character issues as well.”

**5.** [**His chairman of the joint chiefs, retired Gen. Mark Milley**](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/29/politics/milley-trump-wannabe-dictator/index.html), seemed to invoke Trump: “**_We don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator_**. We take an oath to the Constitution and we take an oath to the idea that is America – and we’re willing to die to protect it.”

**6.** [**His first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson**](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/15/politics/tillerson-foreign-policy-interview/index.html): “(Trump’s) understanding of global events, his understanding of global history, his understanding of US history was really limited. **_It’s really hard to have a conversation with someone who doesn’t even understand the concept_** for why we’re talking about this.”

**7.** [**His first ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley**](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/09/21/nikki-haley-donald-trump-rotary-club-history-response-vpx.cnn): “He used to be good on foreign policy and now he has started to walk it back and get weak in the knees when it comes to Ukraine. A terrible thing happened on January 6 and he called it a beautiful day.”

**8.** [**His presidential transition vice-chairman, Chris Christie**](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/09/14/chris-christie-trump-doj-political-opponents-2016-and-now-sot-cnntm-vpx.cnn): “**_Someone who I would argue now is just out for himself_**.”

**9.** [**His second national security adviser, HR McMaster**](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/01/17/sotu-mcmaster-full.cnn): “We saw the **_absence of leadership, really anti-leadership_**, and what that can do to our country.”

**10.** [**His third national security adviser, John Bolton**](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/05/16/john-bolton-donald-trump-foreign-leaders-sot-cnntm-vpx.cnn): “**_I believe (foreign leaders) think he is a laughing fool_**.”

**11.** [**His second chief of staff, John Kelly**](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/02/politics/john-kelly-donald-trump-us-service-members-veterans/index.html): “**_A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law_**. There is nothing more that can be said. God help us.”

**12.** [**His former acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney**](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/mick-mulvaney-says-he-resigned-on-jan-6-because-trump-failed-as-president/), who resigned as US special envoy to Ireland after January 6, 2021: “**_I quit because I think he failed at being the president when we needed him to be that_**.”

**13.** [**One of his many former communications directors, Anthony Scaramucci**](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/01/15/anthony-scaramucci-trump-historical-view-sot-ac360-vpx.cnn): “He is the domestic terrorist of the 21st century.”

**14.** [**Another former communications director, Stephanie Grisham**:](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/04/politics/stephanie-grisham-donald-trump-2024/index.html) “I am terrified of him running in 2024.”

**15.** [**His secretary of education, Betsy DeVos**](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/09/politics/betsy-devos-trump-january-6/index.html), who resigned after January 6: “When I saw what was happening on January 6 and didn’t see the president step in and do what he could have done to turn it back or slow it down or really address the situation, it was just obvious to me that I couldn’t continue.”

**16.** [**His secretary of transportation, Elaine Chao**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQ2vNnxhVE), who resigned after January 6: “At a particular point the events were such that it was impossible for me to continue, given my personal values and my philosophy.

**17.** [**His first secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/richard-spencer-i-was-fired-as-navy-secretary-heres-what-ive-learned-because-of-it/2019/11/27/9c2e58bc-1092-11ea-bf62-eadd5d11f559_story.html): “…_**the president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically**_ or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices.”

**18.** [**His first homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert**:](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/donald-trump-capitol-mob/index.html) “_**The President undermined American democracy baselessly for months**_. As a result, he’s culpable for this siege, and an utter disgrace.”

**19.** [**His former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJ4d_AsfYg): “**_Donald’s an idiot_**.”

**21.** [**A former director of strategic communications, Alyssa Farah Griffin**](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/politics/alyssa-farah-trump-lied-resignation-cnntv/index.html): “We can stand by the policies, but at this point we cannot stand by the man.”

**22.** [**A top aide in charge of his outreach to African Americans, Omarosa Manigault Newman**](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/11/politics/omarosa-tell-all-white-house/index.html): “Donald Trump, who would attack civil rights icons and professional athletes, who would go after grieving black widows, who would say there were good people on both sides, who endorsed an accused child molester; Donald Trump, and his decisions and his behavior, was harming the country. I could no longer be a part of this madness.”

**23.** [**A former deputy press secretary, Sarah Matthews**](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/09/14/sarah-matthews-trump-unfit-for-office-griffin-tapper-sot-lead-vpx.cnn)**,** who resigned after January 6: “I thought that he did do a lot of good during his four years. I think that his actions on January 6 and the lead-up to it, the way that he’s acted in the aftermath, and his continuation of pushing this lie that the election is stolen has made him wholly unfit to hold office every again.”

**24.** [**His final chief of staff’s aide, Cassidy Hutchinson**](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/26/politics/cassidy-hutchinson-book-trump-white-house-chaos/index.html): “**_I think that Donald Trump is the most grave threat we will face to our democracy in our lifetime_**, and potentially in American history.”

But Jobs?!?!    America has lost more jobs during Covid than most any other nation.

And for his first three years of his presidency he massively increase our deficit during a period when the country was already booming.
Sure.  Just spend spend spend…. Things will be great…  until they are not.

~-~-~

Of course you agree with Putin…. He was talking to you.
You say    ``trump is helping the situation’’ 

This is a much longer conversation.  But I think trump is not a good negotiator for America, his aims are small and short term at come at great cost to the long term.  Twenty years from now I think historians will look back on the Trump presidency as a pivotal time in the loss of the USD as a reserve currency,  that is worth tens of TRILLIONS of dollars to the USA.

~-~-~

But look at the number of his own appointees that after working with him have said negative things about his ability to lead.
Those are the people he chose!

#### No meeting with the Russians

- It never happened.
- It happened, but it wasn’t connected to the Russian government.
- They were Russian government, but they just wanted to discuss adoption policy.
- We went in expecting to receive dirt on Hillary Clinton, but the Russians didn’t have it. Any campaign would’ve taken that meeting.


#### Taking money from other govs
 One could also make a decent case that foreign governments funneling money to Trump’s private accounts by spending big at his properties violates the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which would be bribery. But the case for collusion is more ambiguous.


#### Clinton Did it too
