    (3) An Atheist's Spiritual Calling
    -  If believe as you do, why are you living your life as you are?
    -  Meaning can be constructed, indeed the only meaning in life it consturucted meaning.
    -  Yet an athiest can spend relatively little time exploring/construting meaning in 
       their life.  
    -  Common reasoning is that there is little point to it, since ultimately 
       there is "nothing" there.
    -  But as we saw earlier all meaning *is* there, it can be no place else.
    -  There can be nothing more important than the construction of meaning, and 
       living life according to that meaning.

    -  Now one might argue that "I have all the meaning in my life I need."
       But consider, if you believe that ultimately everything you do has no point 
       beyond physical pleasure, and consequences to any otherwise meaningless world,
       you don't have a very deep meaning.

    -  What more impt activity do you have beyond the exploration and constuction of meaning.

    -  Specifically what could one do?

    -  The fallacy of pleasure, of contributions, of kindness, of enrichment.

    -  Argument that strong meaning cannot exist, thus it ceases to be interesting, sought after,
       or a reasonable definition for the word meaning.  
       Constructed meaning is a natural replacement.
       you may feel that constructed meaning is a farse, but think hard about this
       it is your fantasy that strong meaning, should, is, what is sought.  It can't be 
       because it is self contradictory.

       what can meaning be?  Meaning is what you feel/believe is meaningful.
       - at first blush this seems circular and incapable of supporting itself

    - What I have found compelling is that constucted meaning can be a 'solid' feeling meaning,
       the process does drive itself, and so it can feel
