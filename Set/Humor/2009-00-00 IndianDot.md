For centuries, Hindu women have worn a dot on their foreheads. 
Most of us have naively thought this was connected with tradition 
or religion, but the Indian embassy in New York has recently revealed 
the true story.

When a Hindu woman gets married, she brings a dowry into the union. 
On her wedding night, the husband scratches off the dot to see whether
he has won a convenience store, a gas station, a donut shop, a 
taxi cab or a motel in the United States. If nothing is there, 
he must remain in India to answer telephones and provide us with technical advice.
