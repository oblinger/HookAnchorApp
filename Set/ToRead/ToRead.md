From Gregory Ormiston (medium)
  The Evolution of human science  stories of your life and others   ted chiang



Ursula Leguin  walk away from ohmelsaa
From Brandon/Alex
Both by Andrew Grove; long-time Intel leader including CEO and chairman of the board.

High Output Management; aimed at both middle and upper management; focused on process & results.  I've finished this one, it's good. This one Nick recommended and Alex seconded.

https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1484065459&sr=8-1&keywords=high-output+management

Only the Paranoid Survive- this is the one that Alex added to the recommendations himself.  A little more geared towards upper management and dealing with major points of change ("inflection points") in company development.  "10x" is mentioned in this book many times. I'm most of the way through this one. I do think a fair amount of what's in here is applicable to startup- and in particular to Aeolus as a whole at the moment since we're making a big change from mostly-hardware to hardware-and-software.

### QL John
nt to chat with our neighbor John to get interview tips since he hired thousands of them. Man, did I learn so much from him! We should hangout with them more often! He actually successfully exited few companies. He sent this link to me since this girl is one of the investors of the company I am going to interview with, and I like her summary about machine intelligence:

### haddick
DanO, this is a long essay that I think I will summarize and modify to meet our needs. Don't spend the time on it unless you are really curious ;-)
The article is a pretty close description of the problem we had scaling at Sierra Nevada Corporation and the function that I turned the VP of Technology role into: Product Management. This is what I was trying to describe in our early conversations. It also explains why it is hard for a startup to see the value because the function is distributed around a tight knit team in a typical startup. We are not a typical startup and my intention is to better define the Program Management need and fill it.

### two books nick gave me
Designing Your Life
Relevant to: The "what opportunities should I say no to?" thinking you have been doing
Quote:"Designers imagine things that don’t yet exist, and then they build them, and then the world changes. You can do this in your own life. You can imagine a career and a life that don’t exist; you can build that future you, and as a result your life will change. If your life is pretty perfect as is, life design can still help you make it an even better version of the life you currently love living."
Competing Against Luck
Relevant to: Your search for a problem for Configurator to solve.
It's basically an ode to concentrating on the problem, not the solution. I think having a framework might help separating the configurator you want from the search for the real market place problem Configurator can solve. If not, it's still a good book ;-)
