    Emotions

    - Angst that I should be doing something
    + Excitement (bordering on angst) of what is possible

    - Restless wanting to do something fun, but not having it nearby
    - Stress that I have too much to do, or that something wont get done in time
    - Guilt that I should be working (more effectively) but am not.



    - Turn Shoulds into Musts
    - Build Discipline.  Avoid rationalizations.




    RATIONALIZATIONS
    - It is where I live.  It is my age.
    - I should not beat myself up.
    - Its more fun to not set specfic goals.
    - There are too many variables to set specific targets.
