never read it.

Here is there question:
Hey TPM team! One of the leads on my team is looking for some TPM training that he could use to
maybe better organize our backlog or SDLC. Do you all have any training or books or courses that you would
recommend? Anything that screams to you "oh wow I wish I could get every single engineering team at the
company to read this book, it would make my life so much easier"?


Hi Qingling! I'm thinking more along the lines of agile methodology, especially when it comes to thinking
about Epics and Issues and the path work takes between ideation to development to deployment. One of the
things we're working on this year is a more organized backlog, and I think we're looking for something that can
speak to the "why" of how work breakdown works.
