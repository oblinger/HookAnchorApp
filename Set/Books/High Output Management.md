### - One-Page Summary

In High Output Management, Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel, shares what he's learned
about management over his decades-long career. One of his main insights is that
manufacturing principles, which1 output and productivity, are very applicable to yet
rarely used in management.
In this summary, you'll learn:
- How to increase your managerial output
- How to increase your managerial productivity
- How to manage on a larger scale

The book is relevant to all managers but may be particularly useful to middle managers
because there are fewer resources available for them (there are many courses for front-line
managers, and most business schools focus on training CEOs). Middle managers are all
managers in between front-line managers and the people at the top of the organizational
chart. The term also includes "know-how" managers who don't formally have reports but
influence the work of others by sharing their knowledge and skills.
(Shortform note: We've reorganized the book's material for concision and clarity.)
Publication History
The original edition of High Output Management was published in 1983. Grove wrote a new
introduction to the book in 1995 because two major events took place that changed the
managing game:
**Event #1**: The world became more globalized. Businesses now had competitors all over the
world, not just locally, and if they didn't adapt, they died. Because so many companies could
supply the same products, speed became a major competitive advantage.
Competition for jobs also increased-managers have to work harder to maintain their personal
competitive advantage. Grove recommends asking yourself the following questions to reflect
on your work. If you answer no to any of them, your career as a manager might be in danger:
• Are you always trying to find ways to make things work better?
• Are you aware of your environment and developments in your field?
• Are you personally experimenting with new technologies and ideas?
**Event #2**: Email was invented. It increased the speed and ease of communication and made
the managerial activity of disseminating information less critical to the job. Keep this in mind
when reading the sections on managerial activities and meetings.

**Managerial Output**
The output of s processes, as manufacturing, is very factory makes
breakfasts, the output is breakfast. Your own output as a manager, however, is less concrete. It's
not the output of your own individual work; it's the output of all the teams you influence. Their
output is determined by the activities you do and how much of an effector leverage-these
activities have.
Written mathematically:
`Your managerial output = team outputs = output of your team + output of teams you influence
`=(managerial activity #1 × leverage of activity #1) + (mgr activity #2 × leverage of activity #2) + ...
Therefore, you can increase your managerial output by increasing the output of your team or
the teams you influence, and/or increasing the value of your activities or your leverage.

**Increasing the Output of Teams**
To improve the output of your team, you need to choose the management style that will best
foster each member's high performance. **The deciding factor regarding which style to use is
task-relevant maturity (TRM)-how educated, experienced, and mentally ready an employee is
to do a particular task in particular circumstances**.
For example, one Intel sales manager was very successful in the field environment-he
high TRM-and Intel promoted him to a plant environment. However, hi TRM ir
new environment was low-he didn't know how to do any of the plant-related tasks.
Here's how you should manage employees with following levels:
**Low**: Provide structure and strong guidance on operational values. Give your team detailed
directions about exactly how, when, and what needs to be done.
**Medium**: Provide some structure and guidance but expect the team to provide some of it
themselves. Instead of managing prescriptively, exchange ideas and communicate.
**High**: Provide minimal structure-the team will provide the bulk of it themselves. Don't involve
yourself with the team's work; just make sure objectives are clear. This style is advantageous
because it allows the manager to delegate to their team members and be confident they
successfully complete the task.
Always monitor your team, no matter what the TRM level is. If the TRM changes, adjust your
management style, up or down.

**Managerial Activities**
You c increase your output by choosing o valuable and/or high-leverage managerial
activities:
1. **Information-gathering** involves collecting data about both the interior and exterior workings
of your company (for instance, about customer complaints or team priorities). Do this by
having conversations with people both inside and outside the company (competitors,
customers, and so on), and y reading written information such as memos. Use both sources
and them against each other-verbal information is quicker at often
incomplete, and written information is more thorough but slower to reach you.
2. **Information dissemination** involves supplying your organization and the people you
influence with hard facts and also communicating goals, priorities, and preferred methods of
doing things. Being informed allows people to do their jobs more efficiently.
3. **Decision-making** involves either making a decision yourself or helping others make
decisions by sharing your opinion, fostering debate, I approving r vetoing ideas. Keep in
mind that whoever's highest in the organizational chart isn't necessarily the person who has
the most hands-on knowledge about a given issue, so ideally choose the decision-maker from
the lowest competent level.
4. **Nudging** is a softer version of decision-making (and a stronger version of information
dissemination) in which you influence people but don't command them.
For example, instead of telling s what decision make, you might offer a
opinion in a meeting about it.
5. **Role modeling** is when you share your values and the kind of behavior you want to see in
your subordinates by demonstrating them.
6. **Training** involves personally teaching your employees how to do the tasks they need to be
able to perform. You should do this yourself rather than hiring external trainers because it's an
inherently high-leverage activity (you can affect many people at once), and because training
works best when it's tailored to company practices and the instructor is an authoritative role
model.
7. **Motivating** involves creating an environment in which people's need For status, more
ideally, self-actualization, is unmet (attempting to meet these kinds of needs provides longer
term motivation than meeting other kinds of needs, such as survival needs). If an employee is
well-trained and capable of doing her job, the only reason she's not performing is that she lacks
motivation.
For example, make work mimic competitive sports because competition is highly
motivating. Make up game, and a way t keep score. For instance, when Intel
started keeping track of how many square feet each janitorial team cleaned, everyone's
performance rose because they started competing with each other to win (winning
provided a status boost).
8. **Giving performance reviews** involves improving the performance of your subordinates (not
	just assessing it). To do this:
	- Determine your expectations.
	- Assess employees' work to determine if they met expectations.
	- Distill your assessment into broad themes and suggestions for improvement.
	- Honestly deliver the feedback verbally and in a report.
9. **Hiring** consists of interviewing a candidate and trying to determine from her self-assessment
if she'll be a good fit, as well as talking to references.
10. **Retaining** involves talking valued employees out of quitting. When a valuable employee
decides to quit because she feels unappreciated, as a manager, you have failed. In this
situation, immediately speak with the employee to show her she is appreciated. Then,
brainstorm ways to keep her at the company, even if it involves transferring her to a different
department and no longer working with her yourself.
11. **Planning** is coming up with actions that need to be done now to affect something in the
To future. To plan, evaluate your current status (what tasks you have in progress and what
capabilities you have left over) and predict if maintaining this status will enable you to meet
on future demands on you and your time. If your status won't meet the demand, adjust your
planned workflow to make them match up.


**Leverage**
Because an activity's value is multiplied by leverage, if you increase the leverage of an activity,
you can increase your output by a large factor.
• For example, imagine that in the earlier equation, activity #1 had a value of 10, activity #2
had value of 20, and the leverage of both was 1, so your output was 30 ((10 * 1) + (20 x
1)). If you can increase the leverage of activity #1 to 5, your output becomes 70 ((10 × 5) +
(20 x 1)).

There are three techniques to increase leverage:
1. Increase the leverage of existing activities. You can do this by affecting more people and
their work, affecting people for a longer period, facilitating automation, or simplifying work (for
example, removing unnecessary steps from workflows).
2. Stop doing activities with negative leverage. Don't micromanage, waffle, or hold a bad
attitude. All of these things will make it more difficult for your reports to get their work done
and will decrease their output.
3. Adjust the number of reports you have. For maximum leverage as a manager, you should
have 6-8 subordinates (or be part of 6-8 coordinating or planning groups) so you can give them
each half a day of your time per week. (Half a day is ideal because it gives you enough time to
effectively monitor but not enough time to micromanage.)

**Managerial Productivity**
Like output, there's a formula to describe managerial productivity (how efficient a ›anager is):
Managerial productivity = managerial output ÷ time = activity ÷ time required for the activity
You an improve your productivity using the strategies to improve output (because activity a
leverage are part of the equations) and one additional strategy: Speed up how long it takes you
to do your activities.
To learn how to speed up, we'll take inspiration from production manufacturing because it
uses excellent time management techniques.
First, we'll look at strategies directly inspired by the three steps of manufacturing. Then, we'll
look at some more general strategies used in manufacturing.
Three Steps to Production
There are three steps to production in a factory:
1. Process, which is transforming raw materials into product parts. To determine the fastest,
most cost-effective way to produce products in a factory, manufacturers first determine
throughput times (how long it takes to prepare individual product parts) and then offset them
at staggered times so they'll all be completed : time ready
assembly). The schedule is arranged around the product part that takes the longest or is the
most complicated to make.
Similarly, as a manager, arr and offset your work schedule (and the schedule of your team)
to ensure that all tasks involved in a particular project complete at the same time (in other
words, the project deadline).
Example #1: If you're working as a cook at a restaurant that makes breakfast consisting of
toast, boiled eggs, and coffee, the limiting step is boiling the egg, which takes the longest
three minutes. You'll arrange the preparation of all the other parts around the egg.
(Shortform example #2: If you're putting together a poetry anthology, the limiting step is
acquiring permission to reproduce the most famous poet's poems. You should apply for
this permission early and then apply for the other permissions as you wait for it to come
through.)
2. Assembly, which is attaching the product parts together (or, in a business context, bringing
each part of a project together).
3. Testing, which examines the raw materials, parts, or the final product (or, in a business
context, project) for flaws. Material gains value as it passes through each production stage (for
example a whole breakfast is more valuable 1 egg). Therefore, you should always try
to catch problems at the lowest value stage to save yourself money (scrapping a faulty part is
less expensive than scrapping a faulty product). To do this, test at three different points during
production:
1. Upon receipt of raw materials
2. During the production process
3. After assembly
In general, the best way to test is "monitoring," which involves taking samples and testing
them while the rest of the material moves or : stage. sample testing t
problem, you can stop the rest of the process.
Manufacturing Strategies for Efficiency
There are six manufacturing strategies that you can apply to management to improve your
efficiency:
1. Use indicators, which are measurements that tell manufacturers (or managers) about what's
going on in the production process (or administrative process) and predict or provide
information about output. To choose which indicators to pay attention to, ask yourself what
information first-thing every day t off potential problems.
• For example, you might want to know how many people you have in the office. If you're
ort-staffed today, to meet your goals, you might need 1 help or take
people off the less important jobs to cover the most important ones.
2. Forecast output. Most manufacturers predict how r orders they're going t and build
enough inventory to satisfy their predictions (as opposed to building only after receiving an
order, which results in long wait times for a customer). As a manager, you can forecast too
predict demands on your time and plan accordingly.
3. Use proven workflows. Manufacturers don't waste time coming up with a new way to do
something if there's already a good existing way. Don't reinvent the wheel as a manager either.
4. Batch. All processes include set-up time, and if you can do all the activities that require the
same set-up together, you only have to spend the set-up time once.
• For example, it requires some time to get into the right mindset to read reports.
Therefore, once you're in the mindset, read all the reports at once.
5. Don't overload capacity. Overloads might cause bottlenecks and materials might have to be
aborted at a higher-value stage. To avoid overloads as a manager, refuse projects you de
have time for.
6. Distribute workload. as try to evenly distribute th eir workload time, which
managers can benefit from too. The main threat to an even managerial workload is
interruptions because they unexpectedly increase workload. To manage interruptions:
Prepare standard responses to common questions.
learn from indicators handy so you c
questions.
Schedule time for questions.
Meetings as a me-Management Tool
Meetings, like manufacturing strategies, can be an effective time-management tool. Meetings
are a medium in which you can do managerial activities, many of which need to be carried out
in person.
There are two types of meetings, and if you use your meeting time perfectly, you'll only ever
need to hold ti • kind:
1. Process-oriented. The goal is to exchange expertise and information. These meetings take
place according to a regular schedule. There are three subcategories:
One-on-ones. The goal is to exchange information and maintain relationships. The
attendees are you and a single subordinate.
Staff meetings. The goal is to facilitate peer interaction, learn the dynamics of your
subordinates, and exchange information in both directions. The attendees are you anc
all of your subordinates.
Operation reviews. The goal is to facilitate learning and connect people who wouldn't
normally interact, such as people who are too far apart in the organization to attend the
same staff meetings. The attendees are managers, presenters, and an audience.
These meetings save time because they allow you to pre-empt problems. If an attendee sees a
potential p alerts you right away, you h o address it before i
larger issue.
(Shortform example: f your s having computer
and tells you right away, you have time to order and receive a new one before the old
one breaks.)
2. Mission-oriented. The goal of these meetings is to solve a problem by making a decision. In
theory, these meetings should never be called because all problems are preempted in the
process-oriented meetings. n practice, however, even if things operate well, about 80% of
problems will be handled in process-oriented meetings and the remaining in mission
oriented meetings.

**Running a Company**
Managing a whole organization, as opposed to
Element #1: Organizational Structures
Organizational structures are arrangements of the organizational chart: 1 instance, they show
which unit in the business does what, and how these units work together (if they do at all).
There are three organizational str
1. Functional. In this centralized structure, individual business units are only responsible for
unit-specifict: Any function t they: another r example, human
resources), is handled by a functional g that handles the shared function for all units. The
advantages of this structure are economies of scale, the opportunity to share expertise (experts
can share their knowledge across the whole company, not just their unit), and units having the
ability focus ( t administration. The disadvantages : e increased bureaucracy
when trying to get help from functional groups, and resource competition between the
distinct units.
2. Mission-oriented. In this decentralized structure, every business unit is responsible for both
its unit-specific tasks and all the other tasks that come with running a business, such as hiring,
purchasing, offices, and so on. Each unit reports to a regional office or the corporate executive
office. The only advantage of this structure is ; units don't have tr wait
on other departments to do anything. The disadvantages are the inability to collaborate with
other units and redundancy (for example, each unit has an HR department when really, the
company only needs one).
3. Hybrid. This structure is a combination of functional and mission-oriented. Individuals can
report to multiple supervisors and be part of multiple organizational charts, which allows them
to fulfill both functional and mission-oriented responsibilities.
For example, Intel has four functional u (sales, technology development,
administration, and manufacturing) and three business units (component,
microcomputer, and system). All of the units report to the executive office.
Ideally, the hybrid structure harnesses all the advantages of each system and dispenses with
the disadvantages. According to Grove's law, as businesses grow, they'll eventually need to
structure because as they get bigger, they have more things to keep track of
need the advantages of a functional structure: well those of the mission-oriented
approach.

**Element #2: Control Methods**
There's no universally optimal way to control people's behavior-the most effective approach
always depends on the circumstances.
There are three different control modes applicable to the workplace:
1. Free-market forces. In this mode, people's behavior is controlled by price (whoever is buying
wants to pay the lowest price, and whoever is selling wants to sell at the highest price possible)
and self-interest. No management is needed because everyone openly does whatever is in
best interest.
(Shortform example: Buying a car is managed by free-market forces--the salesperson
make as h money as possible, an buyer spend : e as
possible.)
2. Contracts. In this mode, people's behavior is controlled by mutually agreed-upon guidelines
that outline what each party will do to what standards and who has the right to monitor work.
Contracts are useful when exchanging goods or services that don't have a defined value, like
al engineer. Management is needed
nanagement helps set and enforce the contract guidelines.
3. Culture. In this last mode, people's behavior is controlled by culture-people believe and
trust that the whole group shares ways of doing things, values, and goals. Culture is a useful
control method when it would be impossible to define dollar values of or contracts
surrounding behavior. Management's role is to develop and establish culture by explaining
ways of doing things, values, and goals and also visibly demonstrating them.


### - Part 1: Managerial Output | Chapter 1: Managerial
**Activities**
In High Output Management, Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel and 1997 Time Man of the
Year, shares what he's learned about management over his decades-long career. One of his
main insights is that manufacturing principles-which have been honed over hundreds of
years and focus on output and productivity--are very applicable to yet rarely used in
management.
In this summary, you'll learn:
- How to increase your managerial output
- increase your managerial productivity
- How to manage on a larger scale
The book is relevant to all managers but may be particularly useful to middle managers
because there are fewer resources available for them (there are many courses for front-line
managers, and most business schools focus on training CEOs). Middle managers are all
managers in between front-line managers and the people at the top of the organizational
chart. The term also includes "know-how" managers who don't formally have reports but
influence the work of others by sharing their knowledge and skills.
(Shortform note: We've reorganized the book's material for concision and clarity.)
Publication History
The original edition of High Output Management was published in 1983. Grove wrote a new
introduction to the book in 1995 because two major events took place that changed the
managing game:
**Event #1**: The world became more globalized. Businesses now had competitors all over the
world, not just locally, and if they didn't adapt, they died. Because so many companies could
supply the same products, speed became a major competitive advantage.
Competition for jobs also increased-managers have to work harder to maintain their personal
competitive advantage. Grove recommends asking yourself the following questions to reflect
on your work. If you answer no to any of them, your career as a manager might be in danger:
Are you always trying to find ways to make things work better?
Are you aware of your environment and developments in your field?
Are you personally experimenting with new technologies and ideas?
**Event #2**: Email was invented. It increased the speed and ease of communication and made
the managerial activity of disseminating information less critical to the job. Keep this in mind
when reading the sections on managerial activities and meetings.

**What Is Managerial Output?**
The output of some processes, such as manufacturing, is very obvious-at a factory that makes
breakfasts, the output is breakfast. Your own output as a manager, however, is less concrete. It's
e output of your own individual work; it's the output ‹ ill the teams you influence. Their
output is determined by the activities you effector leverage-thes
activities have.
Written mathematically:
You managerial output = team outputs = output of your team + output of teams you influence
= (managerial activity #1 × leverage of activity #1) + (managerial activity #2 × leverage of activity
#2) + .
Therefore, you can increase your managerial output by increasing the output of your team or
the teams you influence, and/or increasing the value of your activities or your leverage.
we'll look at l to increase the output of teams by choosing an appropriate managing
Then. 'I look at high-leverage managerial activities that you can engage in to increase
your output. Finally, we'll look at how to increase leverage.

**Increasing the Output of Teams**
To improve the output of your team, choose the management style that will best foster their
high performance. The deciding factor in this decision is task-relevant maturity (TRM)-how
educated, experienced, and mentally ready an employee is to do a particulartask in particular
circumstances.
For example, one Intel sales I very successful in the field environment-he
had high TRM-and Intel promoted him to a plant environment. However, his TRM in this
new environment was low-he didn't know how to do any of the plant-related tasks.
Here's how you should manage employees v following TRM levels:
Low: Provide structure and strong guidance on operational values. Give your team detailed
directions about exactly what needs to be done, how, and when.
Medium: Provide some structure and guidance but expect the team to provide some of it
themselves. Instead of managing prescriptively, exchange ideas nd communicate. (N
mode most difficult fo managers because hitting a balance is challenging
than meeting an extreme.)
High: Provide minimal structure-the team will provide the bulk of it themselves. Don't involve
yourself with the team's work; just make sure objectives are clear. High TRM is advantageous
because:
The managing style is less time-consuming.
The manager can be confident about delegating because she knows her subordinates
can handle the task.
When teams are managing themselves, motivation usually comes from self
actualization, which is the only need in Maslow's hierarchy of needs that can never be
satisfied and thus provides a permanent source of motivation. (We'll discuss Maslow's
hierarchy of needs and motivation further in Chapter 2.)
Always monitor your team, no matter what the TRM level is. If the TRM changes, adjust your
management style, up or down.
None of these management styles are better r worse than others. Many managers feel the
prescriptiveness of low-TRM management isn't nice or sophisticated, but your goal isn't to be
these things--it's to l effective.
Friendships With Subordinates
Whether you foster friendships with subordinates is up to you. It's easier to care about and
communicate with someone you're friends with but harder to revert to a formal relationship if
necessary because ordering a friend around can be awkward. Additionally, close personal
relationships don't necessarily result in communicating management relationships.
Grove has seen friendship with subordinates work: he's alsc discipline end
friendships. To figure out if you can handle imagine that you're giving a critical performance
review to an existing friend. If the thought makes you uncomfortable, don't become friends
with your subordinates.

Five Valuable and/or High-Leverage Managerial Activities
You can also increase your output by choosing to do valuable and/or high-leverage managerial
activities. We'll cover five activities in this chapter and the rest in subsequent chapters.
Activity #1: Information-Gathering
Information-gathering involves collecting about both the interior and exterior workings of
your company. You'll use what you l from this activity to inform all of your other
managerial activities.
There are two main sources of information, and you need to gather both:
Verbal, via conversations with people both inside and outside the company (competitors,
customers, and so on). Verbal information is more up-to-date than written information and
therefore valuable, but often insufficient or even incorrect because in conversation, people
don't always mention all relevant context.
There good ways to get access to verbal information:
Talk 1 o people who want ' do things for them. They're often excellent sources of
information because they'll tell you ts of things to get you ‹ side.
Visit part of the company, observe proceedings, and engage in casual conversation. (In
contrast, if people come see you in your office, you spend a social
niceties and don't actually exchange that much information.) If you feel awkward about
wandering around without a specific goal, schedule a visit that has a task associated with
it, such as a safety check. This will give you a good reason to walk around and talk to
people.
2. Written, via memos, reports, and so on. Written information travels more slowly than verbal
information but is necessary and valuable because:
The information is more thorough than what can be covered in a conversation.
The author has to think to write the text-the exercise involves self-discipline, precision,
and reflection. Even if no one reads the final product, the author will have gained from
writing it.
The reader can use written information to validate verbal information and as a reference
in the future.
You should have multiple sources of both verbal and written information so that you can
compare the different accounts to each other to confirm they're accurate.
Activity #2: Disseminating Information
A second managerial activity is supplying information to your organization : the people
you influence. Information includes hard facts but also goals, priorities, and preferred methods
of doing things. If you don't share this information, then your reports won't know how you want
things done and their output will be sub-par.
Sharing information also contributes to the development of culture, which we'll look at more in
later chapters.
Activity #3: Decision-Making
The third managerial activity is decision-making. As a manager, you have two decision-making
roles:

1. decisions yourself.
2. Help others make decisions by giving them information or opinions, debating with them,
and approving or vetoing their choices.
To consider the two kinds of power:
1. Position, which is authority given by an organizational chart and job title.
2. Knowledge, which comes from working closely with the details of a business.
In traditional industries with a strict organizational hierarchy, decision-making responsibilities
were assigned based on position power, so the higher-ups in the chart would make the
decisions. However, in knowledge industries, a person with position power may not have as
much knowledge power as someone lower in the chart because they're more distanced from
day-to-day operations, and the faster-moving the industry or customer preferences, the larger
the disconnect.
For example, a recent college graduate will be more up-to-date on current technology
than a manager who's been working for years.
Therefore, the best way to make decisions is to harness both kinds of power and make the
decision at the lowest competent level-lowest because lower people are closer to the action
and technical know-how, and competent because technical knowledge doesn't always come
with judgment or experience. As a middle manager, you're uniquely positioned 1 this
because you're in contact with both power-holders.
If you can't find people who have both the technical knowledge and judgment to make, or help
you make, the decision, then create a decision-making group that includes a mix of people:
some of whom have technical expertise, and some of whom have n strong judgment. It's
someone senior, she must act as an equal to everyone else involved : that
everyone feels comfortable participating in the discussion rather than deferring to the senior
leader.

Ideal Decision-Making Model
It's important to adhere to a standard decision-making process for two
1. It's faster-you don't have up a new process every time.
2. It's less frustrating for the affected parties. If people know upfront who will be making and
approving the decision, they know there's the possibility the decision they've been working
on will be vetoed. If they don't know this upfront, even if there's a good reason for th
they'll potentially see the veto as political maneuvering or become demoralized.
are There are four steps to Grove's ideal decision-making model:
Step #1: Address the Six Pre-Decision Questions
Before starting the decision-making process, to promote an optimal, efficient decision, y
must give everyone involved in the process the answers tr the following six questions:
1. What is the decision?
For example, Intel had to decide where to build a new plant in the Philippines. The
choices were a location next to an existing plant (which would be more convenient but
more expensive because space was limited and the building would have to be
multistory) or : / location.
2. What is the deadline?
Intel had to decide within a month so that there would be enough time 1 build th
plant before it was needed.
3. Who will make the decision?
Intel's facilities people (who knew about costs and construction) and manufacturing
plant managers (who knew about operational benefits) would make the decision
together. Three managers from approximately equal power-positions represented each
group.
4. Whom do need to talk to before making the decision?
The managers of each group spoke with their staff tr gather relevant information.
5. Who will approve c reject the decision?
Grove would do this because he first n person in the organizational
chart (the president) above the senior managers. He was also familiar with the existing
Philippines plant.
6. Who needs to know the decision?
Grove would tell the chairman of the board. He wasn't directly involved with plants, but
building a new plant is a big business decision and therefore relevant to the chairman.
Step #2: Encourage Free Discussion
Discussion should cover all points of view and all relevant information because the best
decision v considering the opinions of all knowledgeable people. Everyone
should s speak freely. Encourage disagreement-it's common for participants t
of the discussion until one view seems likely to win and then jump in to support this view, but
this behavior won't produce the best decision because it results in people withholding their
true opinions.
Free discussion ends when you've heard and considered all the information. At this time, push
for a consensus, or make the decision yourself (you'll be well-informed thanks to the free
discussion). This timing is important:
If you end a discussion too early, y won't have all the information you need to make a
good decision.
If you don't end it, it could go forever and people could get further from the right
decision.
For example, the Intel groups considered all the information about the new plant's possible
locations, including costs, geography, and traffic patterns. They thought it would work best to
build the new plant beside the old plant but keep the new plant small to avoid huge costs.
Step #3: Explain the Decision Clearly
Once something is decided, it should be explained as clearly as possible to everyone who will
be affected by it.
People tend to be vague about controversial decisions to avoid arguments with those who
disagree with the choice, but you should do the opposite. Being vague doesn't prevent an
argument, it just postpones it, and people don't like being kept in the dark.
If the decision is very different from what was on the table (for example, if Grove had canceled
the construction of the plant), announce it, give people some time to digest it, and then later,
talk about it with everyone. Some time for reflection and the opportunity to share feedback
will help people accept the decision.
Step #4: Demand Full Support
Everyone involved i decision r st support it. They don't to agree with it-it's
always possible to get agreement on everything because everyone has differences of opinion
but they must commit to executing it.
Challenges Associated With the Model
This four-step process comes with challenges:
1. Unnaturalness. Middle managers often 1 del awkward because they struggle to
express their views, make hard decisions, a et behind decisions they don't agree with.
Emotions. It's hard for people to separate their emotions from decision-making, and people
tend to get even more emotional when they have to make decisions with people they don't
know. If there's a big divide between knowledge and power, € feel uncertain.
People might fear sounding stupid and not speak, or fear being overruled and therefore feel
embarrassed.
To manage your emotions, per that you, all people, are smart and have
3. Peer-group syndrome. When in a group of peers, most people are reluctant to express an
opinion because they don't want to say something that the rest of the group doesn't agree with.
Therefore, people t around n circles until they feel confident that the group is leaning
towards something (or if this doesn't happen, they talk forever). One member will state the
perceived consensus weakly using first-person plural, so it's not attached to them personally. If
they've read the room right, everyone else will start supporting the position too. This is
disadvantageous because it cuts the discussion short, and without examining all points of view,
it's harder to make a good decision.
There are two ways to avoid this circling:
Put someone in charge of the meeting. If this p that peer-group syndrome
is developing, they must intervene and set the decision-making process back on course.
Choose whoever will be most affected by the outcome of the decision as the leader, or
call in a more senior manager (which is called a peer-plus-one approach at Intel). A
senior manager can advise on decision-making techniques and lend the group some
confidence.
Instill self-confidence in all of the peers. Tell everyone that there are no life-threatening
consequences of making a suggestion that's overruled or a wrong decision.
Activity #4: Nudging
The fourth managerial activity is nudging, which is a softer version of decision-making (and a
stronger version of disseminating information) in which you influence people but don't
command them.
For example, instead of telling someone what decision to make, you might offer an
opinion in a meeting about it.
Nudging and decision-making should be distinct. You'll probably nudge a dozen times as
as you decide.
Activity #5: Role Modelling
The fifth activity is role modeling, in which you share your values and the kind of behavior you
want to see by demonstrating it. Telling people what you want in a memo will never be as
effective as showing them visibly. do this in whatever way r leadership style
such as working one-on-one or giving a presentation.
(Shortform example: If you want employees to be punctual, always be on time yourself.)

### - Chapter 2: Training and Motivation
In the last chapter, you learned about five of the 11 managerial activities. In this chapter, you'll
t another two: training, and creating a motivational atmosphere.
There are only two reasons an employee doesn't do her job: Either she's untrained and
therefore incapable, or she's not motivated. To figure out which it is, ask yourself if she could do
the job if her life depended on it. If she couldn't, the problem is capability; if she could, the
problem is motivation.
For example, even if Grove's life depended on playing the violin, he couldn't do it, so the
problem is capability. If his life depended on running a six-minute-mile, he wouldn't
enjoy it, but he would be physically capable of doing it, so the problem is motivation.

Activity #6: Training
Employees who aren't trained properly, no matter good their intentions, can cause a
sorts of problems for a company ranging from bad performance to excess costs to life
threatening situations.
You, as a manager, should train your subordinates (and possibly their subordinates) yourself
than hiring outside training specialists because training works best when:
's consistent and regularly scheduled, rather a workshop or a one-off event.
Instruction is tailored to company practices (an outside instructor wouldn't familiar
with these)
The instructor is an authoritative role model.
To figure out what to train your people in:
Make a list of what you think your team needs training in. Write down everything you can
think of, including things that sound simple, such as how to answer the phone.
Ask your team what they think they need training in. Probably, some of it will surprise

Assess the availability of instructions and materials.
Choose which items on your list are most important.
To develop a training program, start small, with a course that includes fewer than five lectures,
because teaching will likely be more difficult than think. When preparing the course:
Acceptt first time you teach course, it won't be great. Choose students who
are knowledgeable and experienced so that you don't confuse them (a beginner would
be likely to just accept everything you say even if it was wrong) and so you get good
feedback.
If a lot of people in the organization will need to take the course and you'll have to teach
it multiple times, invite people who could potentially te e course to your first
lectures so they can learn to instruct.
Initially, outline the whole course but only put together the first lecture. Put together
the second lecture after giving the first. This will allow you to learn from the experience
of the first lecture and amend your teaching style according to what worked and what
didn't.
After finishing tl course, ask the participants for feedback using Some of the
questions should be a numerical rating, but some should also be open-ended
questions.
Consider the survey results. It's normal to get contradictory feedback and you'll never be
able to make everyone happy, so use your judgment to determine what to change.
Example: Training at Intel
Intel, employees spend 2-4% of their time in classroom learning and teaching is
done by the company's managers. Managers teach over 50 classes on a variety of subjects.
For example, Grove teaches classes on giving performance reviews and conducting
meetings. He also gives new employees their introduction to Intel.
There are two types of training at Intel:
1. Teaching skills w employees. How many people need training depends on how many
new employees join the company through turnover and growth.
2. Teaching new skills to existing employees. Usually, a whole department needs training.
The e people who require training, the longer more expensive it is, but it's
worth it.

Activity #7: Motivating
employee's poor performance isr to a lack of training, it may be due to a lack o
otivation. Motivation c e inside, so you can't instill on someone.
What you foster an environment where people can become motivated and perform

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
According › Abraham Maslow, people are motivated l desire to satisfy their needs. Once
a need is met, motivation ceases. Therefore, to create motivation, you need to create a climate
in which some of people's needs are constantly unsatisfied.
People have many needs and they fall into a hierarchy-only once you've satisfied your most
important and basest needs do you start trying to satisfy your higher needs.
Here are the needs, in order of lowest to highest:
1. Survival, which is the need for basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter.
2 Safety, which is the need for things that allow access to basic necessities. (Shortform
example: Having a job is a safety need because it allows you to buy the food you need to
survive.)
3. Belonging, which is the need to be part of a group of like-minded members and the need
for love and relationships.
4 Status, which is the need for recognition or esteem, or to keep up with others. Often, this
recognition is only valuable to the person seeking it.
5. "Self-actualization," which is the need to achieve your personal best or a higher purpose.
There are two drivers of this need:
Competence. This is the drive to become a master of a particular skill. The majority of
people are competence-driven.
2. Achievement. This is the need to be good at everything you do.
The first three needs inspire employees to get a job and report for work. All three of them are
possible to satisfy, so when they're met, motivation ceases.
example. Intel plant the Caribbean, r y worked until they had
made a certain amount of money. Once they had as much as they thought they needed
satisfy their needs, t auit.
The last two needs encourage high performance. Status is satisfiable, so motivation will
eventually cease once an employee reaches a certain level of success, but self-actualization is
limitless because there's no concrete goal attached to it. Therefore, as a manager, you need to
get everyone to the self-actualization stage to tap into their best performance.
Reaching Self-Actualization
To help everyone reach self-actualization:
where people fall in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. e way to
they view money raises. If a subordinate gets a r she's concerned with the absolute
value. she's working at the survival or security level. If she's concerned with the relative
value (how t compares r coworkers'), then she's likely after: or self
actualization ar using money as a measure of achievement.
For example, a venture capitalist motivated to make $10 million who already has $10
million doesn't need money to meet survival, security, or social needs. Additionally,
more money probably won't give her more status because venture capitalists don't
usually announce their success. Therefore, for her, money is a record of how much she's
achieved.
2. Reassess hierarchy position from time to time. People can move both up and down
Maslow's hierarchy.
example, \ n manufacturing employees at an Intel plant in California
working their higher needs and there n earthquake, they all regressed to
meeting survival needs.
3. Base achievement recognition on output. Only attach status and self-actualization to
achievements that are output-relevant. Otherwise, people will be motivated to work towards
things that don't benefit the company, such as competing for the nicest office chair.
For example, at Intel, knowledge for the sake of knowledge isn't particularly recognized,
but applying that knowledge to produce results is.
4. Consider the effects of fear. In the past, fear of punishment was the main motivational
strategy. (If people didn't work, they didn't have the money to eat. Their only option would be to
steal food, the punishment for which was hanging. Therefore, people were motivated to work
to avoid the punishment of death.) At the time of writing, fear was being replaced by more
humane motivational strategies. However, fear is still present in status and self-actualization,
though it's usually internally-generated fear of failure. Fear can be motivating--it encourages
people to perform-but it can also become an obsession, which results in a reluctance to take
risks because they come with the danger of failure.
5. Create opportunities for people to test themselves. People will produce greater output
trying to achieve things that are just beyond their reach (self-actualization is always a little out
of reach).
6. Make work mimic competitive sports. Competition is highly motivating, so if you can tap
into this, you can increase performance. To do this:
Dispense with the idea that work is drudgery and if you spend too much time doing it
you're a workaholic-start thinking of work as a competitive sport instead. No one thinks
that athletes who spend a lot of time training are dull or have a problem.
• Create a competitive atmosphere by making up a game, rules, and a way to keep score
using indicators. To do this, you have to see the job from the point of view of the people
who are doing it.
For example, when Intel started keeping track of how many square feet each
janitorial team cleaned, everyone's performance rose because they started
competing with each other to win (winning offered a status boost).
Encourage people to view failure like losing a game-in sports, few people give up
halfway through the game out of fear of losing. They keep playing even when their score
is low.

Manage like a coach. Be critical of people's performance (which will encourage good
performance), don't take credit for wins (this will make your team trust you), and share
your knowledge of the "sport" (work) because you probably did it yourself so have
valuable insights to provide.
7. Provide feedback. When striving to meet the need for self-actualization, motivation is
generated by the drive to improve, and it's impossible to improve without feedback. People
provide their own internal feedback-for example, when a professional violinist is practicing
and hears herself play a wrong note, she can go over the section again until she gets it right
but also require external feedback. We'll look at how to provide this in the next chapter.



### - Chapter 3: Performance Reviewing
You've now learned about seven of the 11 important managerial activities. In this chapter, we'll
look at the eighth: giving performance reviews.

Activity #8: Performance Reviewing
The primary goal of a performance review improve performance (not just assess it). Giving
performance reviews is a high leverage activity because it affects the recipient's performance
for a long time-she often recalls the feedback. Performance reviews should be used in all
organizations regardless of size because performance matters to every organization.
Managers don't naturally write good reviews for three reasons:
1. Delivering and receiving feedback can be unfamiliar and emotionally awkward. Most of us
don't have much practice at performance review-like work because American society
discourages conflict (which negative reviews can generate). Recall good reviews you've been
given for guidance.
2. Assessing performance, especially of knowledge workers and managers (whose output
depends on others' output), is challenging.
3. Performance is tied to compensation and rewards, two complicated and touchy subjects.
First. we'll look at a four-step process for how to handle the first two difficulties and write good
performance reviews. Then, we'll look at how to handle the third difficulty.

Step #1: Determine Expectations
Before you can assess performance, you need to determine your expectations so that the
review can focus on whether or not your subordinates met them. (Failing to do this is the major
problem with most reviews.)
As you come up with your expectations, remember that output is an important marker of
performance. Consider the recipient's actions, not just her results, because:
1. Often, there's a delay between doing an activity and seeing the output. The output might not
accurately reflect the results of the recipient's activities during the period the review covers.
For example, when Grove was reviewing one of the managers who reported to him, the
manager's output measures were all strong--for example, sales had increased. There were
some signs that not all was well-for example, the manager's organization had higher-than
usual turnover-but Grove prioritized the output measures and gave the manager a good
review.

The next year, the output measures had all declined. Grove looked carefully at the situation
and realized that the offset between the manager's activity and output was about a year. The
output measures were only good the first year because they had been set up by previous
employees and only come to fruition years later. Therefore, the manager hadn't deserved the
good review because the outputs didn't reflect his actual performance. Interestingly, the
manager's performance had actually improved since the first year, even though the output
measure didn't reflect this at all: His work just hadn't come to fruition yet.
2. You need to assess both shortand long-term projects. Long-term projects may not show
output for years, so to evaluate them, consider the future gains and what they're currently
worth.

• (Shortform example: A writer's short-term work is to prepare articles. Her long-term
work is to refine her workflow so she can write future articles faster. Her long-term work
takes time away from her short-term work, therefore affecting her performance, but will
speed up her work in the future.)

Step #2: Assess Performance
Once you've established your expectations:
1. 1 s recipient to write a self-review for you to reference because:
If you give her the same feedback she provided you with, she'll feel cheated.
She'l you 1't paying enough attention t f you / paying
attention, you'd have enough content for the review on your own.
Her review might sway you.
2. Gather data on the recipient's performance by collecting meeting notes, progress reports,
and so on.

3. On a blank sheet paper, \ down every thought you have about the recipient's
performance. Don't edit them or order them by importance; just write down your stream of
consciousness.
4. Once you've finished, look for broad themes. Probably, you'll see evidence that the person
does the same actions in various contexts.
(Shortform example: If one of your subordinates always hands her reports in late, there's
a good chance that she also misses other deadlines.)
Don't focus potential or appearances because it doesn't matter how professional someo
acts or how good she could be-for example, if the recipient is a manager and her team doesn't
perform, her performance is flawed.
5. Call these themes "messages" and make a list of them. Then, support the messages with
examples from your worksheet. (Ideally, none of your messages are surprising because you
ne recipient al provide guidance regularly. If you discover something you weren't
expecting that might appear to person as coming out of left field, include it anyway: They
need to know about it to improve their performance.)
6. If the list of messages is too long for the recipient to remember, cut the less critical ones.
You can probably mention them in a future review.

Step #3: Provide Feedback
As discussed, the goal of the performance review is to improve performance. Therefore, after
assessing performance, you need to provide task-relevant feedback-feedback that is directly
related to work-to guide recipients toward improvements.
There three formats f providing feedback in performance reviews:
Type #1: Alternate Positives and Negatives
In this type of review, which is very common, managers list negative feedback and then temper
it with positive feedback. These reviews aren't very effective at improving performance
because:

They're superficial and disorganized, which will confuse the recipient.
The amount of feedback is overwhelming. People can only absorb so much at once, and
if overloaded, they either can't absorb any or forget everything they
o far.
Type #2: Address a Major Problem
In this form of review, you discuss and try to resolve a single fire-worthy performance problem.
Likely, when you bring w a major problem, the recipient will go through the following stages:
1. Refuse to acknowledge the problem exists. To show the recipient the problem is real, use
examples and evidence.
2. Deny that it's a problem. Again, use evidence to show that the problem is real.
3. Accuse others of causing the problem. In this stage, the recipient accepts that the problem is
real but doesn't think it's her fault and therefore doesn't plan to do anything about it. This tends
to be the hardest step to get through. If she can't get through it on her own, use your position
power. r that you understand she doesn't see the problem t way you de and
that either o ou could be right, but it's your responsibility to he organization to give
instructions.

4. Assume ownership of the problem.
5. Find a fix. You should help the recipient do this. It's typically easier than the other steps
because finding fixes is a matter of logic, and moving through the other steps is emotional,
which is more difficult for some people to handle.
The recipient may not go through all the stages, and if she doesn't move on from one, you can't
either (it's impossible to talk about fixing a problem that someone refuses to admit even
exists)
There are three ways this review can end:
1. The recipient agrees with your assessment and agrees to implement your suggested fixes.
The recipient doesn't agree with your assessment but does agree to implement yoi fixes.
For example, Grove once asked a manager to rewrite a performance review. The
manager thought it was a waste of time, but he did do it.
3. The recipient doesn't agree with any of it.

The first outcome is ideal because if the recipient feels the same way about the problem as
do, she'll likely be more motivated to solve it. However, the second option is acceptable
too because while it might not be as emotionally comfortable to disagree, the problem will still
get solved. The third option is not acceptable.
Type #3: Review a High-Achiever
In this review, you give feedback to a high achiever. Because the goal of a review is to improve
performance, always include suggestions for improvement, even if someone is already doing
well. (When it comes to high performers, there's a tendency to simply summarize the
subordinate's work instead of providing suggestions to improve.)
High performers do lot for e organization, so if you can improve their performance even
more, you'll improve the company's output significantly.

Step #4: Deliver the Review
Once you've decided which type of feedback to provide, it's time to deliver the review. You
should give : recipient a written review in advance of your in-person discussion because:
Reason #1: It will give her time and privacy in which to process the information. She'll be more
prepared to discuss her review when the time comes.
Reason #2: If you give her the written review after the discussion, she might find something
that surprises her because she wasn't listening carefully in the meeting and get upset about it.
Reason #3: If you give the written review during the meeting, she may pay more attention to it
than what you're saying. Additionally, she won't have time to prepare what she wants to say in to
response.
For example, o manager reads a subordinate a few paragraphs of the review and then
they discuss. However, the subordinate is eager to hear the whole thing and may be
distracted imagining what else is in the review instead of engaging in the discussion.
There three important to-dos when it comes to delivering the in-person review:
1. Be honest and straightforward. The process won't be helpful if you give incomplete or wishy
washy feedback. Handle both negative and positive feedback with the same honesty and
straightforwardness.
2. Confirm that the recipient is absorbing your feedback. Just because you're talking to
someone doesn't mean she's listening or processing-if she's emotional, thinking of what she'll
say in response, or is tuned out, she may not hear what you're saying.
Use your senses to make sure you're getting through to the recipient. For example, watch her as
you're talking to her. If her body language indicates she's not listening, keep communicating. It's
your responsibility, not hers, to get the message across.
3. Focus on the recipient. The review is about her, not you. You'll likely have strong emotions
because giving a review can be nerve-wracking, but you need to control them.

Promotions and Performance
Promotions should be based on performance because when you promote someone, you
create a role model and show what qualities (high performance) you value.
Note that when you promote someone who's exceeding expectations, her performance will
actually decrease in the new position to merely meeting expectations. This is because she's still
learning the role and navigating new responsibilities. As she gets more experience, training, and
motivation, her performance will improve and she'll start exceeding expectations again.
You may fear promoting exceptional people because you don't want their performance to
decrease, even temporarily. However, if you don't promote them, you're wasting a resource.
Eventually, they lose motivation, stop exceeding expectations and drop back to only meeting
them, and settle for being average.
If you promote a position that she's not even able to meet expectations in, it's not
the failure of the employee, it's the failure of management-you made a bad judgment call
about her abilities. In this situation, you can fire her (which Grove thinks is "dead wrong"), or,
you can "recycle" her-return her the position she held (in which she exceeded
expectations) before she was promoted. She'll probably be embarrassed, but if you're
straightforward and supportive she'll likely get over it quickly. You might promote her again
later, once she's gotten her confidence back and you've better assessed her readiness.

Compensation and Performance
Compensation, like promotions, should be based on performance to reinforce the importance
of good performance.
There three ways to determine base salaries:
1. Experience, which ties compensation only to time. The longer an employee has spent in a
position, the more she's paid. This model is the easiest to implement and to justify to
employees, but it implies that performance isn't important.
For example, good teachers and bad teachers who have the same amount of
experience are paid exactly the same.
2. Merit, which ties compensation only to performance and output. This model can be
awkward because:
It's hard to completely discount experience when determining someone's salary.
Money is limited (if you have lots of high performers, you can't afford to pay them all
well).
It's socially awkward to rank people by performance because someone always comes
in last.
3. Combination, which is a compromise between the two systems above. Often, new people
(with the same experience: none) start at the same base salary but raises based on their
performance.

No matter which system you use, salaries should max out because all jobs have an upper limit
to their value Once someone I the maximum, don't keep giving raises on a schedule.
Paying Managers
When it comes to paying managers you supervise, whose output is more difficult to determine
because it's based on other people's, you should create a performance bonus that at least
part of the managers' compensation is based on team performance. This reinforces that a
manager's output is related to her team's. The higher the total compensation, the higher the
percentage of the bonus should be.
For example, senior managers, who usually already have a lot of money (and therefore
think of it as a measure of achievement rather than a means to satisfy need) should get
a higher percentage bonus, such as 50%. Middle managers should get 10-25% because
they're still motivated by the practical need for money rather than the status-based
need-if they get enough money to satisfy all their basic needs, they might not need
more and could stop working.
To build an effective performance bonus system:
• Determine which team's performance is linked to the manager.
• Determine what time period to consider when awarding the bonus. The manager needs
to receive the bonus soon enough after doing the work that she can connect it to the
work. Keep in mind that sometimes there's a delay between activity and output,
however, so the bonus may need to be somewhat delayed.
Determine if the bonus is based entirely on objective measures (for example, profit) or
subjective measures (a performance review).
Determine how to keep the bonus system within budget.
For example, don't build a system that requires you to give large bonuses if the
company is in a financial crisis.
For example, you might end up with a system where different factors contribute a percentage
to the overall performance bonus. 5% could be determined by individual performance, 5%
could be from the immediate team's performance, and 5% from the company's performance.
This allows you to make each type of performance visible.

Reviews of You
You can ask your subordinates to review you as a manager, but make it clear that their review of
you is informal and advisory, while your review of them is your job. Never pretend you're on the
same level as your subordinates in review.

 Step #2: Assess Performance
Once you've established your expectations:
Don't ask v's recipient to y for you because:
If you give her the same feedback she provided you with, she'll feel cheated.
She'll feel like you weren't paying enough attention to her-if you had been paying
attention, you'd have enough content for won your
Her review might sway you.
2. Gather data on the recipient's performance by collecting meeting r progress reports,
and ›on

3. On a blank sheet of paper, write down every thought you have about the recipient's
performance. Don't edit them or order them by importance; just write down your stream of
consciousness.

Once you've finished, look • broad themes. Probably, you'll se evidence t person
does the e actions in various contexts.

a good chance that she also misses other deadlines.)
Don't focus ( on potential or appearances because it doesn't matter how professional someone
acts how good she could be-for example, if the recipient is a manager and her team doesn't
perform, her performance is flawed.
5. Call these themes "messages" and make a list of them. Then, support the messages with
examples from your worksheet. (Ideally, none of your messages are surprising because you
monitor the recipient and provide guidance regularly. If you do discover something you weren't
expecting that might appear to the person as coming out of left field, include it anyway: They
need to know about it to improve their performance.)

1. Be honest and straightforward. The process won't be helpful if you give incomplete or wishy
washy feedback. Handle both negative and positive feedback with the same honesty and
straightforwardness.
2. Confirm that the recipient is absorbing your feedback. Just because you're talking to
someone doesn't mean she's listening or processingif she's emotional, thinking of what she'll
say in response, or is tuned out, she may not hear what you're saying.
Use your senses to make sure you're getting through to the recipient. For example, watch her as
you're talking to her. If her body language indicates she's not listening, keep communicating. It's
your responsibility, not hers, to get the message across.
3. Focus on the recipient. The review is about her, not you. You'll likely have strong emotions
because giving a review can be nerve-wracking, but you need to control them.

Chapter 3: Performance Reviewing
You've now learned about seven of the 11 important managerial activities. In this chapter, we'll
look at the eighth: giving performance reviews.

Activity #8: Performance Reviewing
The primary goal of a performance review is to improve performance (not just assess it). Giving
performance reviews is a high-leverage activity because it affects the recipient's performance
for a long time-she often recalls the feedback. Performance reviews should be used in all
organizations regardless of size because performance matters to every organization.
Managers don't naturally write good reviews for three reasons:
1. Delivering and receiving feedback can be unfamiliar and emotionally awkward. Most of us
don't have much practice at performance review-like work because American society
discourages conflict (which negative reviews can generate). Recall good reviews you've been
given for guidance.
2. Assessing performance, especially of knowledge workers and managers (whose output
depends on others' output), is challenging.
3. Performance is tied to compensation and rewards, two complicated and touchy subjects.
First, we'll look at a four-step process for how to handle the first two difficulties and write good
performance reviews. Then, we'll look at how to handle the third difficulty.

Step #1: Determine Expectations
Before you can assess performance, you need to determine your expectations so that the
review can focus on whether or not your subordinates met them. (Failing to do this is the major
problem with most reviews.)
As you come up with your expectations, remember that output is an important marker of
performance. Consider the recipient's actions, not just her results, because:
1. Often, there's a delay between doing an activity and seeing the output. The output might not
accurately reflect the results of the recipient's activities during the period the review covers.
For example, when Grove was reviewing one of the managers who reported to him, the
manager's output measures were all strong-for example, sales had increased. There were
some signs that not all was well-for example, the manager's organization had higher-than
usual turnover-but Grove prioritized the output measures and gave the manager a good
review.

The next year, the output measures had all declined. Grove looked carefully at the situation
and realized that the offset between the manager's activity and output was about a year. The
output measures were only good the first year because they had been set up by previous
employees and only come to fruition years later. Therefore, the manager hadn't deserved the
good review because the outputs didn't reflect his actual performance. Interestingly, the
manager's performance had actually improved since the first year, even though the output
measure didn't reflect this at all: His work just hadn't come to fruition yet.
2. You need to assess both shortand long-term projects. Long-term projects may not show
output for years, so to evaluate them, consider the future gains and what they're currently
worth.

(Shortform example: A writer's short-term work is to prepare articles. Her long-term
work is to refine her workflow so she can write future articles faster. Her long-term work
takes time away from her short-term work, therefore affecting her performance, but will
speed up her work in the future.)

2. You need to assess both shortand long-term projects. Long-term projects may not show

worth.

work is to refine her workflow so she can write future articles faster. Her long-term work
takes time away from her short-term work, therefore affecting her performance, but will
speed up her work in the future.)

Step #2: Assess Performance
Once you've established your expectations:
1. 1 s recipient to write a self-review for you to reference because:
If you give her the same feedback she provided you with, she'll feel cheated.
She'l you 1't paying enough attention t f you / paying
attention, you'd have enough content for the review on your own.
Her review might sway you.
2. Gather data on the recipient's performance by collecting meeting notes, progress reports,
and so on.

3. On a blank sheet paper, \ down every thought you have about the recipient's
performance. Don't edit them or order them by importance; just write down your stream of
consciousness.
4. Once you've finished, look for broad themes. Probably, you'll see evidence that the person
does the same actions in various contexts.
(Shortform example: If one of your subordinates always hands her reports in late, there's
a good chance that she also misses other deadlines.)
Don't focus potential or appearances because it doesn't matter how professional someo
acts or how good she could be-for example, if the recipient is a manager and her team doesn't
perform, her performance is flawed.
5. Call these themes "messages" and make a list of them. Then, support the messages with
examples from your worksheet. (Ideally, none of your messages are surprising because you
ne recipient al provide guidance regularly. If you discover something you weren't
expecting that might appear to person as coming out of left field, include it anyway: They
need to know about it to improve their performance.)
6. If the list of messages is too long for the recipient to remember, cut the less critical ones.
You can probably mention them in a future review.

Step #3: Provide Feedback
As discussed, the goal of the performance review is to improve performance. Therefore, after
assessing performance, you need to provide task-relevant feedback-feedback that is directly
related to work-to guide recipients toward improvements.
There three formats f providing feedback in performance reviews:
Type #1: Alternate Positives and Negatives
In this type of review, which is very common, managers list negative feedback and then temper
it with positive feedback. These reviews aren't very effective at improving performance
because:

They're superficial and disorganized, which will confuse the recipient.
The amount of feedback is overwhelming. People can only absorb so much at once, and
if overloaded, they either can't absorb any or forget everything they
o far.
Type #2: Address a Major Problem
In this form of review, you discuss and try to resolve a single fire-worthy performance problem.
Likely, when you bring w a major problem, the recipient will go through the following stages:
1. Refuse to acknowledge the problem exists. To show the recipient the problem is real, use
examples and evidence.
2. Deny that it's a problem. Again, use evidence to show that the problem is real.
3. Accuse others of causing the problem. In this stage, the recipient accepts that the problem is
real but doesn't think it's her fault and therefore doesn't plan to do anything about it. This tends
to be the hardest step to get through. If she can't get through it on her own, use your position
power. r that you understand she doesn't see the problem t way you de and
that either o ou could be right, but it's your responsibility to he organization to give
instructions.

4. Assume ownership of the problem.
5. Find a fix. You should help the recipient do this. It's typically easier than the other steps
because finding fixes is a matter of logic, and moving through the other steps is emotional,
which is more difficult for some people to handle.
The recipient may not go through all the stages, and if she doesn't move on from one, you can't
either (it's impossible to talk about fixing a problem that someone refuses to admit even
exists)
There are three ways this review can end:
1. The recipient agrees with your assessment and agrees to implement your suggested fixes.
The recipient doesn't agree with your assessment but does agree to implement yoi fixes.
For example, Grove once asked a manager to rewrite a performance review. The
manager thought it was a waste of time, but he did do it.
3. The recipient doesn't agree with any of it.

The first outcome is ideal because if the recipient feels the same way about the problem as
do, she'll likely be more motivated to solve it. However, the second option is acceptable
too because while it might not be as emotionally comfortable to disagree, the problem will still
get solved. The third option is not acceptable.
Type #3: Review a High-Achiever
In this review, you give feedback to a high achiever. Because the goal of a review is to improve
performance, always include suggestions for improvement, even if someone is already doing
well. (When it comes to high performers, there's a tendency to simply summarize the
subordinate's work instead of providing suggestions to improve.)
High performers do lot for e organization, so if you can improve their performance even
more, you'll improve the company's output significantly.

Step #4: Deliver the Review
Once you've decided which type of feedback to provide, it's time to deliver the review. You
should give : recipient a written review in advance of your in-person discussion because:
Reason #1: It will give her time and privacy in which to process the information. She'll be more
prepared to discuss her review when the time comes.
Reason #2: If you give her the written review after the discussion, she might find something
that surprises her because she wasn't listening carefully in the meeting and get upset about it.
Reason #3: If you give the written review during the meeting, she may pay more attention to it
than what you're saying. Additionally, she won't have time to prepare what she wants to say in to
response.
For example, o manager reads a subordinate a few paragraphs of the review and then
they discuss. However, the subordinate is eager to hear the whole thing and may be
distracted imagining what else is in the review instead of engaging in the discussion.
There three important to-dos when it comes to delivering the in-person review:
1. Be honest and straightforward. The process won't be helpful if you give incomplete or wishy
washy feedback. Handle both negative and positive feedback with the same honesty and
straightforwardness.
2. Confirm that the recipient is absorbing your feedback. Just because you're talking to
someone doesn't mean she's listening or processing-if she's emotional, thinking of what she'll
say in response, or is tuned out, she may not hear what you're saying.
Use your senses to make sure you're getting through to the recipient. For example, watch her as
you're talking to her. If her body language indicates she's not listening, keep communicating. It's
your responsibility, not hers, to get the message across.
3. Focus on the recipient. The review is about her, not you. You'll likely have strong emotions
because giving a review can be nerve-wracking, but you need to control them.

Promotions and Performance
Promotions should be based on performance because when you promote someone, you
create a role model and show what qualities (high performance) you value.
Note that when you promote someone who's exceeding expectations, her performance will
actually decrease in the new position to merely meeting expectations. This is because she's still
learning the role and navigating new responsibilities. As she gets more experience, training, and
motivation, her performance will improve and she'll start exceeding expectations again.
You may fear promoting exceptional people because you don't want their performance to
decrease, even temporarily. However, if you don't promote them, you're wasting a resource.
Eventually, they lose motivation, stop exceeding expectations and drop back to only meeting
them, and settle for being average.
If you promote a position that she's not even able to meet expectations in, it's not
the failure of the employee, it's the failure of management-you made a bad judgment call
about her abilities. In this situation, you can fire her (which Grove thinks is "dead wrong"), or,
you can "recycle" her-return her the position she held (in which she exceeded
expectations) before she was promoted. She'll probably be embarrassed, but if you're
straightforward and supportive she'll likely get over it quickly. You might promote her again
later, once she's gotten her confidence back and you've better assessed her readiness.

Compensation and Performance
Compensation, like promotions, should be based on performance to reinforce the importance
of good performance.
There three ways to determine base salaries:
1. Experience, which ties compensation only to time. The longer an employee has spent in a
position, the more she's paid. This model is the easiest to implement and to justify to
employees, but it implies that performance isn't important.
For example, good teachers and bad teachers who have the same amount of
experience are paid exactly the same.
2. Merit, which ties compensation only to performance and output. This model can be
awkward because:
It's hard to completely discount experience when determining someone's salary.
Money is limited (if you have lots of high performers, you can't afford to pay them all
well).
It's socially awkward to rank people by performance because someone always comes
in last.
3. Combination, which is a compromise between the two systems above. Often, new people
(with the same experience: none) start at the same base salary but raises based on their
performance.

No matter which system you use, salaries should max out because all jobs have an upper limit
to their value Once someone I the maximum, don't keep giving raises on a schedule.
Paying Managers
When it comes to paying managers you supervise, whose output is more difficult to determine
because it's based on other people's, you should create a performance bonus that at least
part of the managers' compensation is based on team performance. This reinforces that a
manager's output is related to her team's. The higher the total compensation, the higher the
percentage of the bonus should be.
For example, senior managers, who usually already have a lot of money (and therefore
think of it as a measure of achievement rather than a means to satisfy need) should get
a higher percentage bonus, such as 50%. Middle managers should get 10-25% because
they're still motivated by the practical need for money rather than the status-based
need-if they get enough money to satisfy all their basic needs, they might not need
more and could stop working.
To build an effective performance bonus system:
• Determine which team's performance is linked to the manager.
• Determine what time period to consider when awarding the bonus. The manager needs
to receive the bonus soon enough after doing the work that she can connect it to the
work. Keep in mind that sometimes there's a delay between activity and output,
however, so the bonus may need to be somewhat delayed.
Determine if the bonus is based entirely on objective measures (for example, profit) or
subjective measures (a performance review).
Determine how to keep the bonus system within budget.
For example, don't build a system that requires you to give large bonuses if the
company is in a financial crisis.
For example, you might end up with a system where different factors contribute a percentage
to the overall performance bonus. 5% could be determined by individual performance, 5%
could be from the immediate team's performance, and 5% from the company's performance.
This allows you to make each type of performance visible.

Reviews of You
You can ask your subordinates to review you as a manager, but make it clear that their review of
you is informal and advisory, while your review of them is your job. Never pretend you're on the
same level as your subordinates in review.

### - Chapter 4: Hiring and Retaining

In this chapter, we'll look at the next two managerial activities: hiring new employees and
retaining existing employees v re decided to quit.

Activity #9: Hiring
First, acknowledge that hiring is hard. In activity #8, you learned how hard it is to assess the
performance of people who already work closely with you even when you have output
measures, specific examples of their work, and a confirmed environment. Evaluating the
potential performance of a stranger is even more difficult. There's no foolproof way to hire
you N all of Grove's recommendations below, you might stil up
hire

When hiring for a position, your goals should be to:
Choose a top performer
• Teach her about yourself and the organization
Figure out if you're a good fit
I about the job
You have two resources with which to do this:
Resource: Interview
The goal of interviewing is to predict how an applicant would at your co based (
her self-assessment of her own abilities. There's no way to avoid using self-assessment at the
interview stage because you don't have access to objective measures of skills, performance,
and other factors. However, even though self-assessments can be inaccurate, they can still
provide good information if, as the interviewer, you're blunt and direct, because this usually
inspires similar directness in the applicant.
are tips for interviewing:
Tip #1: Aim to learn the following types of information:
Technical skill level. Ask her to describe a project she's completed or about her skills
veaknesses tell you if s the job you're hiring for.
Ability to apply skills. Ask questions about previous successes and failures to determine
f the applicant knows how to actually apply her skills.
Discrepancy between knowledge and actions. If a person is capable but didn't perform,
find out why. Ask about issues at her current job and what she's learned from past
mistakes.
Values. Ask why she wants a new job and why she feels your company is a good fit. Her
values will tell you how she will approach the job. (Shortform example: If you run a non
profit that rescues animals, and the applicant values humane treatment of animals, she'll
likely approach her job with a lot of passion and motivation.)
Tip #2: Listen. The applicant should talk for 80% of the time so you can learn as much about
them as possible.
Tip #3: If the applicant gets off topic, interrupt her and tell her you'd like to change the subject.
only have an hour or two-use it wisely.
Tip #4: Use the same language and make sure you both understand the meaning of any jargon
you use.
Tip #5: Ask the applicant to consider a hypothetical situation. For example, when Grove was
interviewing an accountant, he asked him to determine the cost a finished Grove
safer manufacturing process al d answered questions about the process,
the accountant didn't know how it worked, and the accountant worked out how to determine
the price.
Tip #6: Ask the applicant if she has questions. This will show you if she prepared for the
interview, if she researched the company, and what she's looking for in a company.
Tip #7: Don't use tricks-for example, giving applicants a broken chair and then seeing how
they react when they fall. Instead, give a realistic first impression of yourself and the company
because it takes first impressions a long time to fade, and encountering tricks during an
interview suggests there will be tricks and traps on the job too.

Resource #2: References
When checking references, you to get pieces of information (see Tip #1)
from references that u aimed to get in the interview. This will be difficult for two reasons:
1. You're usually talking to someone you don't know at a company you don't know, so it's hard
to accurately weigh someone else's assessment of performance when you're not familiar
with the environment or company culture.
2. Many references don't give specific criticisms.
o mitigate challenges, develop a bond with e reference to get her to open i
you. Do this by finding something you have in common or stretching out the conversation to
e you time to connect.
After talking to references, ideally, interview the applicant again to address anything that came
up.

Activity #10: Retaining
The last managerial activity is talking people out of quitting. When a valuable employee
decides to quit because she feels unappreciated, as a manager, you have failed. Your failure
doesn't necessarily end with the departure of that one employee. The actions of good
employees affect your other employees as well-people who respect and identify with the
departing employee will be affected by what happens to her and potentially become
demotivated and consider leaving themselves.
Usually, someone will tell you that she wants to quit when you're in the middle of something
important. You should:
1. Immediately talk to her. This probably won't be your first reaction-the conversation will be
uncomfortable and your instinct will likely be to wrap up whatever important thing you were in
the middle of first. However, if your employee is quitting because she thinks you don't care
about her, pushing off the conversation until later only reinforces her belief.
2. Ask her why she's decided to quit and listen. She's probably rehearsed this conversation, so
let her get through her script without interrupting, and only ask questions at the end. Her script
probably didn't touch on her real reasons for quitting, so try to get her to reveal those by
encouraging her to talk more.
3. Don't argue or try to change her mind yet. At this early stage, all you should do is ask for
some time to come up with a solution.
4. Go talk to your supervisor-this is a major problem you need help with. Your supervisor will
also probably be in the middle of something important, but you need to make her help you.
While your subordinate quitting is more destabilizing for you, her departure will affect the
whole company.
5. Brainstorm ways to keep the employee at the company. This can include transferring her to
a different department-while you'll lose her, the company won't. As a manager, it's your (and
all managers') responsibility to keep valuable employees with the company, even if you don't
get to work with them yourself.
6. Speak with the employee again and present your solution. She might counter by:
Suggesting you only made changes because she forced/blackmailed you into doing so.
Tell her that everything you're doing you would have done anyway-it had been an
oversight not to do it sooner.
Reminding you of her acceptance of another company's offer. Remind her that she's
made a commitment to your company too, and this commitment is stronger because
she's actually worked with people at your company.

### - Chapter 5: Planning and Delegating

In this chapter, we'll first look at the 11th and final managerial activity, planning-coming up
with actions that need to be done now to affect something in the future. Then, we'll look at
delegating, which will help you make time to complete the 11 activities we've explored.

Activity #11: Planning
There are four steps to effective planning:
Step #1: Determine Demand and Conduct Difference Analysis
In management, demand comes from your environment, which is the other groups in your
organization that closely interact with you.
To determine your demand, consider:
What other people in the company currently expect from you. For example,
manufacturing process engineer Cindy is in charge of the method for making
microchips. Her environment consists of new methods and tools and people who work
with her, such as development, production, and product engineers. All of these people
want something different from Cindy-less required experimentation, more
documentation, or finished microchips, respectively.
• Technological developments. (Shortform example: After the invention of email, people
no longer needed physical memos.)
The performance of the groups that support you. (Shortform example: If you depend on
the communications department to announce your projects, do they have enough
resources to meet your needs?)
Then, consider the expected state of all these factors in the future to determine the difference
between what people expect of you now and what they might expect in the future. This is
called a difference analysis.
Don't try to resolve anything yet-that will come in the next steps.
Step #2: Evaluate Your Current Status
There are two things to consider when evaluating your current status:
1. What you're capable of doing now
2. The projects you're currently working on. Consider timing and all whether all of the projects
will actually be completed (usually, some projects get canceled).
Use the same vocabulary to describe status and demand. For example, if your demand is for
"completed product designs," refer to anything in-progress is a "partly completed product
design." That way, you can more easily compare your status and demand.
Step #3: Reconcile
In this step, you'll change what you're currently doing so that you can meet future
environmental demand. To do this, ask yourself two questions separately:
• What needs to be done?
What is possible to do?
Decide on your strategy (a general summary of what you plan to do) and tactics (what you'll
actually do to make your strategy come true), keeping in mind how your actions will reconcile
and how long this reconciliation will take.
Make sure › involve the people who will be responsible for implementing the plan. For
example, Cindy made a list and a schedule of what steps the development engineers needed
to do to produce enough documentation for her needs. She spoke with the development
group's manager to negotiate what was possible.
Scheduling Implementation
You only need to implement actions that need to be done in between the present moment
and your next re-evaluation of the strategy you determined in step #3. For example, every
year, Intel plans for the next five years. Because they plan annually, they only need to focus on
implementing one year's strategy, because they'll look at the other four years and one new year
in the next plan.
Don't plan too often, or you won't have time to get the feedback you need to adjust your plan
before you have to implement it.

Management by Objectives (MBO)
When planning for short-term concerns, you can use the "management by objectives (MBO)"
technique. Because the timeline is short, you should already have good idea of present
demands on your time, so MBO focuses on steps 2 and 3 of the previous section. When using
MBO, you need to determine only two things:
1. Objectives. Only choose a small number of objectives for yourself and your subordinates-if
you have too many, your focus will be diluted, and none of them will be done well. Note that if
your subordinates meet their objectives, this will result in your objective being met because
their objectives are o execute tactics, which will lead to carrying out the strategy, which is your
objective.
For example, in 1491, the government of Spain needed money t‹ continue the war
against the Moors. With the help of her subordinate Christopher Columbus, Queen
Isabella decided to look for a new trading route. The queen's objective was money and
Columbus's was to find the new route. If he found the route, she would get her money.
2. Milestones (indicators of pace). These need to include specific wording and dates so that it's
very clear whether they're reached. The deadlines should be short so you can get feedback on
your progress quickly.
For example, some of Columbus's milestones to acquire ships, test the ships, and
sail.

Subordinates can still miss objectives even if they reach all the milestones on time. However,
this doesn't necessarily mean they've performed badly-they may have just focused on other,
equally productive opportunities.
For example, Columbus built the ships, tested them, and set sail, but he never found the
trading route he was looking for. He did, however, find the New World, which made
Spain a lot of money.

Delegating
To give yourself time to do the valuable and high-leverage actions in this chapter and the
previous ones, you're going to have to stop doing low-leverage activities. You can do this by
delegating-many lower-leverage activities do need to be done, but not necessarily by you.
There are some criteria for delegating:
1. You and the person you're delegating to need to know the same information and be in
agreement about how to do the task. If the person you're delegating to can't do the task
without you giving them step-by-step instructions, you'll need to spend a lot of time giving
directions, al e leverage of this time will be low.
2. You can keep the tasks you like doing as long as you're consciously aware of what's
motivating your decisions to delegate or not to delegate. If you give away a task out can't let go,
you'll spend time on regardless, and leverage will remain low.
3. Monitor the person you've delegated to. Even if you're not doing the task yourself, you're
responsible for it getting done, SO can't completely step back. To monitor:
Check tasks at early stages (draft rather than a polished final report), so that people don't
spend: lot of time finessing something with substantive problems.
Monitor people more often if they're doing something new r unfamiliar, but less often if
they have experience with the specific task you've given them. (Monitor based on task
relevant experience, not experience in general.)
• Take samples of the work you're monitoring instead of inspecting everything. You only
need to check enough work to make sure things are going well.
(Forr nore on monitoring, see the Testing" section in Chapter 6.)
4. When possible, delegate the tasks you're familiar with rather than the ones you aren't
because it will be easier to monitor something you already know how to do.
5. If you're delegating decision-making, monitor the decision-making process. Ask the person
to reflect before presenting a decision. Then, ask a question to monitor how well reflected.
For example, at Intel, when someone decides to purchase new capital equipment, she
prepares a presentation and requests approval. After the presentation, her superiors ask
her about her decision t confirm that she's thought through everything.

### - Chapter 6: Leverage
In the previous chapters, we looked at the activity term of the managerial output equation. In
this chapter, we'll look at the leverage term. Because an activity value is multiplied by leverage,
if you increase the leverage of an activity, you can increase your output by a large factor.
For example, in the first equation, imagine activity #1 had a value of 10, activity #2 had a
value of 20, and the leverage of both was , SC your output was 30 (10 x 1 + 20 x 1). If you
can increase the leverage of activity #1 to 5, your output becomes 70 (10 x5 + 20 x1).
There are three techniques to increase output when it comes to leverage:

Technique #1: Adjust the Number of Subordinates Who Report to You
For maximum leverage as a supervisory manager, you should have 6-8 subordinates so you
can give them each half a day of your time per week. (Half a day is ideal because it gives you
enough time to effectively monitor but not enough time to micromanage.)
Though know-how managers don't have official subordinates, they should also aim to
influence 6-8 people or 6-8 coordinating or planning groups.
If your organization's hierarchy doesn't provide you with the right number of subordinates, you
"act' as a lower role to get the right amount.
• For example, if you manage a manufacturing plant, it might be divided into two divisions,
engineering and production. This would mean only two people, the leaders of each
division, would report to you. You can act as either the production or engineering
manager, rather than hiring someone to fill the role, so that you get that position's
subordinates.

Technique #2: Increase the Leverage of Existing Activities
We've already looked at how to choose effective managerial activities. Now, we'll look at how to
make these activities more powerful, which you can do in five ways:
1 Affect : larger number c people. Often, you can do this by doing activities at the opportune
moment-when you're in the presence of influence many people at once.
• For example, finance manager Robin is in charge of organizing Intel's financial planning
process. If she gives all the presenters clear directions on what they should prepare in
advance of the first meeting, the presenters and audience (around 200 people) will all
have a clear idea of what needs to be done. If her initial directions are confusing and
people don't prepare or bring the right information to the meeting, Robin would have to
have individual conversations with people after to clear things up, this would take her a
long time and therefore provide low leverage.
2. Affect people for a longer period, ideally by doing something that only takes you a short
amount of time.
For example, it might only take you a few hours to prepare a performance review, but
your feedback will affect an employee's performance for months.
3. Automate. Look for ways to help automate your subordinates' work-machines can help
people increase their output.
4. Simplify workflows. Often, workflows contain unnecessary steps that can be eliminated to
streamline to process. To simplify:
Create a flowchart that shows every single step of the process.
Count the number of steps.
Set a goal for reducing the number of steps. A 30%-50% reduction is appropriate in most
cases.

Ask yourself why each step exists. Eliminate those with no or weak justification (such as
tradition or bureaucracy).

Technique #3: Stop Doing Activities With Negative Leverage
Some managerial activities have negative leverage-they reduce the effectiveness of people
on your team.
• For example, if activity #4 has a value of 40 and leverage of 1, and activity #5 has a value
of 50 and leverage of-1, your output is-10 (40 × 1 + 50 x-1).
Three activities usually come with negative leverage:
1. Managerial meddling, which is when a manager takes over her subordinate's work. It's
negative leverage because after it happens enough times, subordinates no longer take the
initiative and instead of doing their own work let the manager do it instead. Meddling usually
comes from a manager having too much free time. When you have discretionary time, start a
backburner project instead of interfering in others' projects.
2. Waffling, which is when a manager procrastinates making a decision that will affect others.
Her subordinates can't do anything until the decision is made, so their effectiveness is
hampered.
3. Holding a bad attitude. When a manager is depressed or negative, the feeling spreads to her
subordinates and discourages them from giving their all.


### - Part 2: Productivity | Chapter 7: Production, Assembly,
and Testing
In the previous part, we learned an equation to describe output and how to influence the
various factors in that equation to increase output. In this part, we'll look at managerial
productivity and methods to improve it, thus increasing your effectiveness as a manager even
further.
Like output, there's a formula for managerial productivity:
Managerial productivity = managerial output + time = activity time required for the activity
You can improve your productivity using the strategies to improve output (because activity and
leverage are part of both equations) and one additional strategy: Speed up how long it takes
you to do your activities. Your own time is the only limited resource-unlike manpower or
capital equipment, you can't get more of it no matter how much you might be willing to pay. As
a result, Grove thinks that time management is the most important part of leadership.
To learn how to speed up productivity, we'll take inspiration from production manufacturing
because it uses excellent time management techniques and they're all applicable to managing
people (even though they're rarely used in this sphere, possibly because assessing tr output
of knowledge work is harder than assessing the output of a factory).
First, we'll look at strategies directly inspired by the three steps of production. Then, we'll look
more general strategies.

Three Steps to Production
There are three steps to production in a factory:
Step #1: Process and Step #2: Assembly
To determine the fastest, most cost-effective way to produce products in a factory,
manufacturers first determine throughput times (how long it takes to prepare individual
product parts) and then offset them (start them at staggered times so they'll all be completed
at the same time and ready for assembly). To do this:
1. Determine the limiting stage, which is making the component that's most time-consuming,
valuable, or sensitive. You'll organize your workflow around this stage.
• Manufacturing example: If you're working as a cook at a restaurant that makes breakfast
consisting of toast, boiled eggs, and coffee, the limiting step is boiling the e which
takes the longest at three minutes.
Business example: In the Intel workflow for hiring new graduates, the limiting step
inviting them to visit an Intel plant because it's the most expensive step-Intel pays for
a students' travel and managers spend a lot of paid time showing the students around.
2. Determine how long the next-longest stage will take. You'll time starting this stage so the
component is ready at the same time as the limiting stage.
Manufacturing example: This is toasting the bread, at one minute. You'll start toasting
the bread two minutes before the egg will be ready.
Business example: Another step involved in hiring a new graduate is on-campus
interviews, which needs to be done far enough in advance to make travel arrangements
for the students who are then invited to tour the plant.
3. Repeat step #2 for all stages.
Manufacturing example: The final stage in the breakfast example is pouring the coffee,
which takes only seconds. You'll start this stage seconds before the toast will be ready.
Business example: An earlier step in hiring new graduates is to do phone screenings to
determine who should be interviewed. This needs to be done early enough to make
travel arrangements for on-campus interviews.
4. Calculate the assembly time and add the assembly time to the time required for the
limiting stage to get the total throughput time.
Manufacturing example: This i how long : will take you to get the toast out of the
toaster, the egg out of the pot, the coffee out of the maker, and arrange all these
components on a tray.
(Shortform business example: The total throughput time for hiring ? new graduate is the
time between preparing a job posting and a students' graduation, after which they start
work.)
Complications
Three things might complicate your process and assembly:
1. Limited equipment availability. If you don't have constant access to equipment, you need to
factor waiting time into your throughput time. Waiting time could make a different
component's production the limiting step.
Manufacturing example: If there are multiple cooks making breakfast a same time,
you may have to wait for the toaster. If you have to wait five minutes for the toaster, you'll
have to get t toast started (find the bread) before you boil egg.
(Shortform business example: If you run a photo printing shop, all of your employees will
need to use the photo printer at some point. If it takes ten minutes to print photos and
line for the printer s always 1 e employees long, that adds half an hour t the
printing step.)
2. Offsetting conflicts. If you're in the middle of one task at the moment you're supposed to
rt another, you'll throw off the timing because you can't both things at once. You could
tO ask someone else to help you, but this isn't dependable. There are three better ways to handle
this:

Option #1: Specialization. Assign everyone involved in the process to a single task, and then
combine everyone's work at the end to create multiple final products (instead of everyone
individually making their own product). e downside is that specialization is expensive
because you need more staff.
Manufacturing example: Imagine you've been promoted from manager
breakfast cafe. Hire one person to make the toast, one to cook the egg, one to pour the
coffee, and one to organize everyone.
(Shortform business example: Ir the photo printing shop, you might hire just one
employee to operate the photo printer, one employee to package the printed photos,
and one employee to operate the cash register and deal with customers.)
Option #2: Purchase e capital equipment. Buy of whatever tools needed
complete the limiting step. The downside is the expense of doing this.
Manufacturing example: If the limiting step making the toast because y don't have
enough toasters to toast all of the required bread, buy another toaster.
(Shortform business example: In the photo printing shop, you may buy another printer.)
Option #3: Increase inventory. Make as many products as you can, so that you'll have constant
access to products so you can supply them as soon as orders come in. The downside is that
you'll have to throw away the extra, which can be expensive.
Manufacturing example: If the kitchen constantly churns out breakfasts, there will
always be one available when a customer arrives, but you'll have to throw out a lot of
food as it cools and spoils and is no longer servable.
(Shortform business example: If you n a toy shop sells Christmas-themed
decorations, order extra wreaths and reorder every time someone buys something.
You'll never out stock, but you will have wreaths left over after Christmas when n
one will want to buy them, and you'll have to throw them out.)
Choose the most cost-effective option. Do this by studying the pluses and minuses of each
factor. You don't have math stopwatch; you just need to reflect enough to
understand the relationships between everything involved in your production process.
• Manufacturing example: The ideal breakfast solution is to buy a continuous egg-boiler
and toaster and assign each piece of equipment a specialized operator. In addition to
expense, another downside is lost flexibility-customers can't get a longer-cooked egg
but the advantages lower more consistent food quality.
3. Unexpected events. Unforeseen circumstances (such as equipment breakdown) can cause
delays and upset the production process. To avoid this, build "slack" (extra time or resources)
into the system so that if there's a delay, you make up for it.
The easiest way to create slack is to build extra inventory. The best way to balance the cost of
building this extra inventory is to keep the inventory at the earliest possible production stage:
For instance, keep extra raw materials rather than extra completed products. In every
production flow, the material gains value at each step of the process. For example, toast is
more valuable than bread, and a three-piece breakfast is more valuable than an egg, toast, and
coffee separately. Keeping the inventory at the lowest-value stage saves you money, as if you
to dispose ( the extra inventory for any reason, you're losing cheap raw materials
rather than expensive finished products.
Manufacturing example: Store extra raw (not boiled) eggs. Raw eggs : cheaper than
boiled ones and won't spoil as quickly.
(Shortform business example: In the toy shop, store extra crafting materials used to
make the Christmas wreaths, not extra wreaths. You may able reuse materials
for other non-seasonal products.)
Step #3: Testing
Testing examines the raw materials, parts, or the final product for flaws. First, we'll look at when
you should test, and then we'll look at the different ways you can carry it out.
Timing of Tests
As we learned, material gains value as it passes through each production stage. Therefore, you
should always try to catch problems at the lowest possible stage to save yourself money.
You should test at three different points during production:
Point #1: Upon Receipt of the Raw Materials
This is also called an incoming or receiving inspection. If you can catch any problems at this
early stage, you can avoid contaminating the whole product with one bad component.
Manufacturing example: If your eggs are rotten, you'll have to throw out all the
breakfasts you make them, wasting toast coffee as well. If you can reject the
eggs before you even get started, you'll save other raw materials.
(Shortform example: If one of your tasks is to organize the printing of a festival program,
look at the page proofs as early as possible so that if there's a critical mistake, you can fix
it before printing samples or the final program.)
If raw material inventory doesn't meet your standards, you have two choices:
Choice #1: Send it back. If you do this, you won't be able to build anything until you replenish
supply, which may cost you in lost opportunity.
To avoid getting into this situation, purchase extra raw material inventory. The general rule is
that you should have enough to last you the amount of time it would take to replace your
inventory.
• Manufacturing example: If you get eggs delivered once a day, you should always keep a
day's worth of eggs, so one day, the delivery is rotten, you have enough to
last until the next delivery. The rule is general because having inventory costs money
(storage space costs money), so you have to consider the trade-off.
Business example: In a managerial sense, raw inventory is yet-to-be-started
discretionary projects that aren't urgent. You should have these backburner tasks to
work so that when you get free time, you aren't tempted to micromanage or interfere
with your subordinates' work.
Choice #2: Use it anyway. If you do this, the quality of some of your final products will be lower.
In manufacturing, the decision is usually based on cost-which is more expensive, an idle
factory, or a lower-quality product? (To decide, manufacturers gather managers from the
manufacturing, design engineering, and quality assurance departments to discuss.)
However, there is one hard rule: Never use unacceptable material if it could cause your
product to completely fail, which is called a reliability problem. Complete failure has
unpredictable and potentially dangerous consequences.
(Shortform manufacturing example: If your company makes bicycle helmets and the
paint you use to color them blue is the wrong shade, go ahead and use it. If there's
something with the life-saving the helmet, don't use them, because
someone could die.)
Point #2: In Process
These tests check the components while they're at Is stages of completion. There a
types:
Type #1: Functional, which involves destroying a product to check its quality.
• Manufacturing example: You might occasionally open an egg after it's been boiled to
make sure it's cooked properly.
Type #2: Process, which involves checking the process t t makes the product. option is
generally better because you don't have to destroy any product.
Manufacturing example: You might check the temperature of t egg-cooking water
using a thermometer to make sure it's hot enough to boil the eggs.
Point #3: After Assembly
This is also called the final or outgoing quality inspection. The final, assembled product is
tested.

Manufacturing example: You might look at the plate of breakfast to make sure all the
components are there. You can visually confirm that they're hot and cooked by looking
for steam.
(Shortform business example: You might look at a report by a subordinate when it's fully
completed and about to be sent off.)

How to Test Cost-Effectively
Testing costs money for two reasons:
1. The actual test requires you to pay inspectors.
2. The testing process disrupts the manufacturing process because it requires you to stop line
or move material back to an earlier stage. Slowing production is expensive because when a
factory isn't producing, it's not paying its running costs.
• For example, if material is rejected at stage four, it may be sent back to stage two,
which upsets the flow of everything currently at stage two.
Therefore, to minimize costs, it's important to carefully consider what type of testing to use.
There are two ways to test and you can use either of them at any stage of the process:
1. Gate, in which all material is held at a certain stage until the inspection is complete. If the
material passes, it all moves to the next step, and if it fails, it all gets thrown out or returned to
an earlier stage.
The disadvantage of this method is that gate inspections take a long time and are expensive.
The advantage is that no substandard material makes it to a higher-value stage.
2. Monitoring, in which you take a sample of the material to test while the rest of it moves onto
the next stage. If the sample fails the inspection, you can stop the line. Monitoring is the best
way to test unless you have reason to believe there's going to be a big problem.
The disadvantage of this method is that some substandard material might get to a higher
value stage before the sample results come back. The advantage is that it's less expensive as
you're not stopping the entire production line, which means you can do more of it for the same
price as a gate inspection. Therefore, you might actually end up with a higher quality product
even though the risk of substandard material sneaking through is greater.
You can also increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of testing by testing on a variable
schedule-testing according to need. For example, if a factory goes days without finding a
problem, inspectors can test less. If problems develop, inspect more often until the quality is
the same as it was before reducing inspections.

### - Chapter 8: Other Productivity-Increasing Strategies
In the previous chapter, you learned how to increase your productivity by taking inspiration
from manufacturing's production process. In this chapter, we'll look at some other
manufacturing strategies that d productivity, as well strategies for efficient and
productive meetings.

Other Productive Manufacturing Strategies
Strategy #1: Use Indicators
Indicators, or measurements, tell manufacturers (or managers) about what's going in the
production pr cess (or administrative process) and provide information about output.
There a myriad of possible indicators ranging from equipment downtime 1 o profit to
customer satisfaction. To determine what your indicators should be, ask yourself what
information you want to know first-thing every day to head off potential problems. Effective
indicators must:
Measure output rather than activity. For example, it's more important to know how
many orders a salesperson received than how many calls she made.
physical and countable. For example, a janitorial indicator might be the number of
square feet cleaned.
Tell you if you're going to meet your operational goals. (Shortform example: The number
f pages of a novel you write today will tell you if you're going o finish your book !
deadline a month.)
For example, here are the five most important pieces of information to a factory manager:
1. Sales forecast, which is how many sales you expect to make in a given time period. To
inform your forecast, compare yesterday's forecast to yesterday's real numbers (the
difference between them is called variance). This will show you if your forecasting is
generally accurate r if you need to reconsider your approach.
2. Raw material inventory, which is how much of the materials manufacturers need to make
the product on hand. If you check this first thing in the morning, you have time to either
order more or cancel a delivery, whichever is needed.
3. Equipment condition. If something has broken down, manufacturers will need to get it fixed
or adjust the process to work around it.
4. Human resources. If some staff are sick, manufacturers have to call in extra help or take
people off the less important jobs to cover the most important ones.
5. Product or service quality. Manufacturers use a variety of measures for this indicator, such
as customer satisfaction.
Indicators are very helpful in types of work besides manufacturing because they:
Provide clarity about individual and team goals
abstract tasks objective
Allow for comparisons between different groups
Help solve problems. When something goes wrong, you can look at your existing data to
see where and how the problem might have started. If you don't have data, you can't do
anything until you collect it, and in the meantime, the problem will likely worsen.
People tend to overreact to what they're paying attention to. (Shortform example: If you're
trying to avoid overstaffing, you might inadvertently reduce your staff so much you don't have
enough people to manage the workload.) To avoid overreacting to an indicator, pay attention to
all areas of your business.
Leading Indicators
There's a special type of indicator, called a leading indicator, that tells you what might happen
in the future. These indicators are useful because they predict problems before they happen,
e preemptive action to avoid them. (However, this is harder than it sounds,
because you don't have an existing problem to justify the expense or anxiety of reacting.)
Leading indicators must be accurate and believable (or else you'll be reluctant to act on them).
There leading are appropriate f‹ of them are only
visible once you've plotted the data on a graph:
Linearity indicator. This indicator is the slope ine of output over time. Ideally, the line
should be straight and ascending (which indicates a consistent output) and hit the desired
point of a particular output at a particular time.
If the graph is a saggy line or not a line at all, then output isn't constant and you'll have to adjust
production in the remaining time to meet the goal. If you continually have concentrated
output right before the deadline, you're probably not using equipment and manpower
efficiently and run the risk of having a problem that derails the goal right before the deadline.
Trend indicators. Like the linearity indicator, this indicator shows output over time but also
takes quality into account: Output must meet a certain standard. This helps you extrapolate
both future output and quality.
Stagger chart. A stagger chart estimates future output numbers a few months in advance and is
updated as the real numbers come in. This allows you to see how close the forecasting was to
reality, which informs your future predictions (Shortform example: If you consistently predict
selling more than you actually sell, start predicting lower). Stagger charts are particularly useful
for forecasting economic trends.
For example, in the chart below, in March, the forecaster predicted that March would see
20 units, April 26 units, and May 32 units. In April, she had the real number for March-21
units, indicated with an asterisk-and predicted a new forecast for the next three
months.

Strategy #2: Build to Forecast
The second strategy is building to forecast, in which manufacturers (or managers) predict how
many orders they're going to get for each product and build enough to satisfy them. The
advantage of building to forecast is that customers don't have to wait for products. (If
to manufacturers waited until they had orders to start building-referred to as the "build to order"
method-customers would have to wait longer for their products.)
Manufacturing example: Intel builds computer parts to forecast this because their
throughput times are long and customers don't want to wait for products.
Business example: As a manager, you can use your calendar to help you forecast
demands on your time and how you'll schedule them. The limiting step (the step that
takes the longest or is most important) is scheduled firmly and the non-time-sensitive
ones can offset where there's space.
Both sales and manufacturing forecast so that both departments are accountable for meeting
their predictions, and they use stagger charts to help with accuracy.
The disadvantage of building to forecast is that if the predictions are wrong, manufacturers end
up with a bunch of leftover inventory or lack the inventory customers do want. However, this is
still preferable to making customers wait.
Delivering built-to-forecast products involves two simultaneous processes with their own
timelines. Ideally, both flows finish at the same time:
1. Manufacturing flow, which involves getting the raw materials through production, to being
finished goods, to the shipping dock.
2. Sales flow, which involves finding customers, selling them the product, securing an order,
and then shipping it.
However much you plan, it's rare that the two flows line up exactly-sometimes, customers
change their minds or there's a mistake in the manufacturing process-which is where the
slack (extra time or resources) you left in the system will come in handy.
Some businesses use both building to order and building to forecast-for example, the
breakfast cafe builds breakfast to order (cooks only start cooking after a customer has ordered)
but buys inventory (purchases eggs, toast, and coffee) based on forecasted demand
because it's not possible to acquire it instantly.
Strategy #3: Use Proven Processes
In manufacturing, most workflows are tested and well-worn. Manufacturers don't waste time
coming up with a new way to do something if there's already a good existing way. Do the same
as a manager. However, keep in mind that the value of a process is the logic behind its steps,
not the steps themselves, so be open to changes if old processes become illogical.
Strategy #4: Batch
All manufacturing processes include set-up time, and if you can do all the activities that
require the same set-up together, you can save time. This process is called "batching."
Business example: It requires some time to get into the right mindset to read reports.
Therefore, once you're in the mindset, read all the reports at once.
Strategy #5: Don't Overload Capacity
If a factory is already booked up, manufacturing leaders don't start new projects because
otherwise, the overload might cause bottleneck and materials might have to be aborted at a
higher-value stage because they spoil while waiting to move on to the next step.
It's harder to avoid overloading capacity in a managerial context because you don't have the
same capacity indicators as a factory, but you must have vague idea of how much time it will
take you to do your usual tasks. Say no to new projects you don't have time for. (Remember
that if you're already fully booked, you can't get the new project done. Also, remember that
your time is finite, so anytime you say yes to something you're turning down something else.)
Strategy #6: Distribute Workload
Factories try to evenly distribute their workload over time. Managers can benefit from this
technique too The main threat to an even managerial workload is interruptions because they
unexpectedly incr ase workload. You can manage interruptions by taking inspiration fre
ctory techniques:
standard (n t custom) products. In ; context, products" a e answers to questions that
interrupt you, which usually come from subordinates or people you influence. Study these
questions and prepare widely applicable responses. In addition to saving you time writing
original responses every time, you can share these responses with others and delegate their
delivery.
For example, many customers get in touch about refunds, and if you pre-prepare a
response, you (and your subordinates) can give it to everyone with the same concern.
Take advantage of indicators. Indicators help you avoid losing time to interruptions by allowing
you to things:
1. Quickly address interruptions. If you have data on hand and readily available, you'll be able
to quickly and easily answer questions.
2. Schedule problem-solving. If your leading indicators warn you that you've got a future
problem, you have to deal with it before it explodes, but you don't have to deal with it
immediately and let it interrupt you.
Encourage other managers to embrace regularity. Because y u work with them, your
schedules have to mesh.
For example, ; y might reserve Monday mornings for planning group meetings.
subordinate interruptions. Don't physically hide from your subordinates when you don't
want to be interrupted-their questions are legitimate. Instead, schedule a time when you're
available for questions.
For example, you might hang a door that says you're doing individual work
and that you'll be available at a later time for questions. It should ask people not to
interrupt you unless it's very urgent.

Meetings as a Time Management Tool
In the previous section, we looked at some strategies to make managerial work more efficient.
Now, we'll look at how to make meetings more efficient.
Many managers hate meetings and think they're a waste of time and a symptom of
disorganization. In reality, meetings al medium i which o activities, and if r
properly, they can be an efficient way to carry out the managerial activities that you learned
about in the previous part (many of which have to be done in-person).
There are two types of meetings, and i f you u ur meeting time perfectly, you'll only ever
need to hold the first kind:
Type #1: Process-Oriented
The purpose of process-oriented meetings is to exchange expertise and information. These
meetings take place according to a regular schedule.
To make these meetings effective, use manufacturing strategies:
them. The meetings should a a same way, cover topics in the
same level of detail, and have clear goals.
Forecast them. Because the meetings are regular, you'll get data on how long it takes te
cover particular subjects or parts of the meeting. Attendees will come to know how
much time to budget for each part.
There are three subcategories of process-oriented meetings:
Subcategory #1: One-on-One
The goal of this type of meeting is to exchange information and maintain professional
relationships.
Attendees

The only attendees this kind of meeting are you as a manager and one subordinate.
The subordinate's job is to:
1. Give you detailed information about her work and concerns.
. Plan the agenda and give i o you in advance. This is for two reasons:
1. The subordinate is attending only one one-on-one, while you're attending several because
e several subordinates. It would be too time-consuming for you to plan several
agendas.
2. Preparing an outline forces the subordinate to reflect on their work and potential problems.
allows you tr pace meeting to spend r what's most important.
The agenda should include a discussion of:
Indicators, especially indicators that suggest problems on the horizon.
Potential problems, even if there are no indicators except int feels
like something is going to u can look at indicators in more detail.
Important events that happened between this meeting and the one before.
Anything in "hold" file, which i where you subordinate file anything that
important but not urgent for discussion in subsequent meetings. (This is a method of
batching.)
Anything that's bothering the subordinate, including her feelings about work-for
example, whether she finds a particular part c of her job frustrating. Tryt › broach
earlier in the meeting rather than at the end so you have time to address it in depth.
notes on the agenda during the meeting. This is because:
It helps her pay attention.
t helps her absorb the information o connect it t what's already on
the page.
n of commitment. When she a note, this implies she will take
action.

Your job, as a manager, is to:
. Soak up the information the subordinate provides.
2. Help the subordinate articulate her problems. When you think the subordinate is finished
talking about something, ask another question to determine if she thinks she's finished talking
about it. Keep asking questions until you both feel you've covered everything.
3. Take notes on the agenda. This is for the reasons the subordinate should take notes,
and additionally, your notes will help you monitor subordinate s she carries out the
actions discussed in the meeting.
Scheduling and Frequency
Schedule the next one-on-one at the end of the current one rather than using a set schedule.
Otherwise, a set schedule may conflict with vacation or a commitment. Plan for every one-on
one to take at least an hour to give subordinates time to talk about complicated issues. (If a
subordinate knows she only has 15 minutes, she's not going to bring up anything that seems
thorny or delicate.)
There are two factors to consider when determining how often to have one-on-ones:
1. Task-related experience. For subordinates that are working at a specific task they don't have
much experience with, one-on-ones more should be more frequent, such as once week.
For experienced subordinates, every : appropriate.
2. Speed of the industry. If things change quickly in your department (for example, marketing
is always a fast-paced field), then you may need to schedule more frequent one-on-ones to
keep

Setting
Hold the one-on-ones near the subordinate's work area. This allows you to observe her and
learn more about her, such as whether her work area is organized and how often she gets
interrupted.
If it's not possible t meet face-to-face, you can dc the one-on-one remotely, but because y
: watch each othert notes, you should t meeting clear what
each person will do.
Subcategory #2: Staff Meetings
The goal of the meeting is to facilitate peer interaction, learn the dynamics of your
subordinates, and exchange information in both directions.
For example, on one team Grove supervised, the team members knew more about each
others did, so he learned more from observing them talk (or argue)
with each other than he did from talking to them individually.
Attendees
The attendees of a staff meeting are you as the supervisor and all of your subordinates.
Your job, as the supervisor, is to:
Moderate the meeting and keep it on schedule. The meeting should have an agenda
(shared in advance so people can prepare their thoughts) and an open discussion period
for issues and housekeeping.
Avoid lecturing-you'll stifle discussion.
The subordinates' role is to participate in the discussion, which should include talk of:
Anything relevant to more than two attendees. If a topic only affects two people, they
can discuss it outside the staff meeting.
Decisions. Staff meetings are good for decision-making because all the attendees are
used working together and know their relative authority.
Subcategory #3: Operation Reviews
The goal of this final meeting subcategory is to facilitate learning and connect people-often
managers-who don't have another medium for interaction (for example, they're too far apart
on the organizational chart to be in the same staff meetings). The meeting should include
presentations by managers of different groups.

managers-who don't have another medium for interaction (for example, they're too far apart
on the organizational chart to be in the same staff meetings). The meeting should include
presentations by managers of different groups.
Attendees

The attendees are two managers-the one who organizes the meeting and the one the
meeting is directed at ("reviewing manager"), presenters, and the audience.
The organizing manager's job is to:
• Handle all the event details, such as booking the meeting room, sending out invitations,
and so

• Supervise the presenters and help them decide what to cover.
Act as timekeeper during the meeting. During presentations, she should gesture
remaining time updates to the presenters.
For example, at Intel, this role might be held by the divisional marketing manager.
The role of the reviewing manager is to:
Share her first impressions. She should never look at the material in advance (her
spontaneous first impressions are valuable).
Ask questions.
• Encourage the rest of the audience to participate.
Set the meeting tone (formal, spirited, and so on).
Role model appropriate conduct.
For example, at Intel, this role might be held by the general manager of a division.
The role of presenters is to:
Use visual aids and a pointer to clarify their points (budget 4 minutes of talking per
visual).
Adjust the speed of their presentation based on the audience's cues-if people's body
language is bored, the presenters can go faster; if people look confused, they should
slow down or clarify.
The audience's job is to:
Demonstrate interest (this boosts the presenters' confidence).
Pay attention.
• Comment, ask questions, and speak up about mistakes.
Type #2: Mission-Oriented
The purpose of these meetings is to solve a problem by making a decision. They're scheduled
in response to a problem's development. In theory, these meetings should never be called
because all problems are preempted in process-oriented meetings. In practice, however, even
if things operate well, about 80% of problems will be handled in process-oriented meetings
and the remaining in mission-oriented meetings because not everything can be preempted.
Attendees

The attendees are the chairperson (often the person who calls the meeting) and the other
people she recruits to help her solve the problem.
The chairperson's role is to:
Decide on attendees. Don't invite more than eight people because with a large group, it
becomes harder to make a decision. Follow up with people once they're invited to make
sure they'll come, or if they can't, that a representative will come.
Create an agenda that explains what decision the meeting will make and everyone's role
in the meeting and decision-making.
Maintain discipline. Don't let people be late because this wastes everyone's time and
costs the company money.
Manage housekeeping. Make sure the meeting room is equipped with all required
audiovisual equipment.
Send out minutes after the meeting. The minutes should summarize the discussion,
decision, and further action, including who should do what next and when. Send out the
minutes soon after the meeting, so no one forgets what happened in the meeting, the
decision, or the next steps.

### - Part 3: Running a Company | Chapter 9: How to Organize
a Company
In the previous two parts, you learned how to improve your managerial output and
productivity by adjusting your activities, leverage, and time management to improve the
performance of your team. Now, we'll look at how to improve the performance and output of
entire organization by effectively structuring and wielding control.
As organizations grow, they have more to keep track of and they often benefit from
restructuring. There are three organizational structures that you can use to structure your
company:

Structure #1: Functional
In this centralized structure, individual business units are only responsible for their unit
specific tasks. Any function that they share with another unit (for example, human resources), is
handled by a group that handles the shared function for all units.
There are advantages to this structure:
Economies of scale. It's cheaper to share resources or buy in bulk. For example, Intel
requires expensive computer equipment. It's more economical to buy one machine that
all the business units share rather than each unit buying their own equipment and only
using it occasionally.
Shared expertise. Knowledge managers can share their expertise across the whole
company, not just their unit, which gives them much more leverage.
Focus on Business units can focus on their work rather than what they need to do their
work (personnel, equipment, and so on) since dedicated departments will deal with
acquiring resources.
There are also disadvantages:
Large workloads. Functional groups have to meet the needs of many units.
Bureaucracy. There are additional administrative layers that take time to work through.
Resource competition. Since business units don't have free and unlimited access to
their own resources, there's sometimes conflict over shared resources f two units
need something at the time.
Distance. Because units focus only on their work, departments such as engineering and
manufacturing tend to be off from the marketplace because their work never
requires dealing directly with customers. As a result, they lose touch with what
customers want.

Structure #2: Mission-Oriented
In this decentralized structure, every individual business unit is responsible for both its unit
specific tasks and all other tasks that come with running a business, such as hiring, purchasing,
offices, and so on. Each unit is responsible for its own hiring, purchasing, offices, and so and
each unit reports to a regional office the corporate executive office.
There's only one advantage to this structure, and that's speed of responsivenesseach unit
can quickly respond to local conditions, such as bad weather that slows down delivery at one
franchise location. Speed is very important-the point of businesses is to respond to their
environment.
The disadvantages of this structure are:
Inefficiency. There's redundancy between business units-for example, each one has to
up set up its own HR department.
Weak company-wide performance. Since every unit acts almost as its own company,
the units are disconnected and can't easily work together.

Structure #3: Hybrid
This structure is a combination of mission-oriented and functional. Ideally, it harnesses all the
advantages of each system and dispenses with the disadvantages. Companies can and should
shift closer to and farther from each pole as they acquire new resources and adapt.
r example, if a company buys a new piece of equipment, it might shift towards
centralization because all the business units would benefit from it
Grove's Law states that any large organization that has a common business purpose will
ultimately move to a hybrid structure. This is because as businesses get bigger, they have more
things to keep track and need the advantages of a functional structure as of the
mission-oriented approach.
Example #1: Intel has four functional units (sales, technology development,
administration, and manufacturing) and three business units (component,
microcomputer, and system). All of the units report to the executive office.
Example #2: Conglomerates don't have a common business purpose, so they tend to be
mission-oriented, though the companies that make up the conglomerates tend to be
hybrid.
The major challenges of the hybrid structure are how to allocate resources between business
units and how to handle resource-related conflicts. Middle managers are perfectly poised to
solve these issues-there are enough of them to manage the workload of allocation (corporate
managers aren't numerous enough) and they're close to those who need the resources to
know how much each unit needs (central allocators are too far away to accurately predict
demand).

Reporting to Multiple Supervisors
Another way to ensure the smooth running of large organizations is to have people report to
two managers, or for people to be part of more than one organizational chart. We'll look at
both cases below:
Case #1: Dual Reporting
Dual reporting is when someone reports le manager, w individual
or a group. Typically, one of the managers supervises the technical aspects of the job (for
example, how to manufacture a computer) and the other supervises the general aspects (for
example, showing up on time).
(Shortform example: A publicist who excels at her job is promoted to marketing
manager. In this role, she supervises ot publicists. A s she gets promoted again ar
again, she acquires subordinates who aren't publicists, and they likely know more about
their jobs than she does. Therefore, she can't help with the technical side of things so
these subordinates need someone else to turn to.)
al reporting is advantageous be
It allows for the hybrid structure. If all supervisors had to have technical knowledge in
the same field as their subordinates, there would be no way to have general managers of
departments.
The technical supervisor can be a peer group rather than a single person. (For example, a
group of engineers who are all supervised by a general manager might get together to
help each other with the particular challenges of engineering work.) There are two
criteria for peer group supervision:
People in peer groups must let the group make decisions they'd normally make
individually.
The organization needs a robust culture so everyone is on the same page about
how things are done.
The disadvantage of dual reporting is that organizational charts become more ambiguous, and
most people don't like ambiguity. However, it's a necessary evil. When an organization gets big
and complicated enough, dual reporting is the only way for an organization to function
effectively.
Dual reporting shouldn't create bureaucracy or busywork (work that takes time but doesn't
produce anything of much value). Keep applying the factory principles: work simplification and
regular evaluations of processes to make sure they make common sense.
Case #2: Multi-Plane
In a multi-plane organization, a given employee is part of multiple unrelated organizational
charts. People don't have t keep n all planessupervisor it
and a subordinate ir the other. There's no confusion between roles and they don't
conflict with each other.
This is advantageous because:
.. People in transitory teams t quickly solve problems.
2. People can participate in more planes.
r example, on one plane, Grove is top the president of Intel.
another chart, he reports to the chairman of a strategic planning group a member.
This allows him, a leader, to have time to participate ir things without having 1 be in
charge of them (being in charge is a huge time commitment).
Often, many of the planar structures are transitory teams-task forces or informal groups that
for e problem they're created to solve.





### - Chapter 10: Control Methods
In the previous two chapters, you learned about the planning and organizational parts of
running a company. In the final chapter of this part, you'll learn about control modes. There's
no universally optimal way to control people's behavior-the most effective approach always
depends on the circumstances.
There are three ways to control your behavior and the behavior of others. We encounter all
three modes throughout our lives, including in the workplace:

Method #1: Free-Market Forces
In this mode, people's behavior is controlled by price and self-interest. Whoever is buying
wants to pay the lowest price, and whoever is selling wants to sell at the highest price possible.
None of the parties care about 1 other-they're concerned only with their own wants.
Therefore, you should use this control method when the parties are mainly motivated by self
interest and the complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity (CUA) of the circumstances are low
(for example, what's bought and sold value in dollars).
(Shortform example #1: Buying a car is managed by free-market forces-the salesperson
wants to make as much money as possible, and the buyer wants to spend as little as
possible.)
Example #2: Manage grad hires using free market forces because they're motivated
by self-interest (they haven't been at the company long enough to feel loyal to it) and
he low (entry-level jobs have well-defined responsibilities).
No management is needed when using this method because everyone openly follows self
interest.

Method #2: Contracts
In this second mode, behavior is controlled by mutually agreedupon guidelines that outline
what each party will do to what standards and who has the right to monitor. Contracts are
useful when exchanging goods or services that don't have a defined value, like the contribution
of an individual engineer. Use this method when parties mainly motivated by group
interest and CUA is low.
(Shortform example #1: If you ask someone to ghostwrite a memoir for you, you can't
encompass the entirety of the job with a list. Instead, you might establish guidelines that
specify that you give the writer a certain amount of money, and they give you their best
effort.)
Example #2: An electrical company might sign a contract with the government to
establish that no other company is allowed to sell electricity in a particular location. In
exchange for the monopoly, che would give the government the right to control
the price of electricity.
Management is needed in this method-management helps set and enforce the guidelines.

Method #3: Culture
In this last mode, behavior is controlled by culture-people believe and trust that the whole
group shares ways of doing things, values, and goals. Culture is a useful control method when it
would be impossible to define dollar s or contracts because the circumstances change
quickly or are unclear. Therefore, use this method when the parties are mainly motivated by
group interest and CUA is high.
(Shortform example: Brenan is a member of a strategic planning community even
though this isn't required by his job description. He joined the group because he feels he
should use his skills to help the company--the company culture promotes such
behavior.)
Management's role is to develop and establish culture, which you can do in two ways:
1. Verbally explain your behavioral expectations.
2. Lead by example. Behave in a way that emulates the culture you want to see.
(Note that when the parties are motivated by self-interest and the CUA is high, o control
method works effectively.)

### - Appendix: Points Exercise
Throughout this summary, you've learned a variety of techniques that will help you become a
high output manager. In this appendix, Grove provides a list of activities that are each worth a
certain amount of points. Do enough of the activities to earn at least 100 points and you'll
improve your managing game significantly.

Production Exercises
For 10 points:
Figure out what parts of your wo st similart production ar 1 assembly
s of manufacturing.
Figure out what the equivalents of manufacturing's testing (receiving, in-process, and
final inspections) are in your work. Determine if your te be monitoring or gate
, and determine the ideal schedule for testing.
Think of an in-progress project, determine the limiting step, and create a workflow to
accommodate it.
Think of six indicators, both quantitative and qualitative, that will predict output.
For 20 points:
Start using your indicators and discuss them in staff meetings.
Reflect on the most important strategy you're executing right now. Consider the
demand that prompted the strategy, your current status, and whether your strategy will
change your future status enough to meet your future demand.

Leverage Exercises
For 10 points:
Determine your most time-consuming task and simplify it. Cut at least 30% of the steps.
Determine your output (as a manager, this is the output of your team and other teams
you influence). Then, put the outputs in priority order.
Consider where ' your information. Are you getting information from a variety of
redundant sources?

Think of a reason why you need to tour your workplace every month.
Consider how you will monitor a delegated project. When will you check in, and how?
Brainstorm some non-ur it projects y work on when y u have discretionary
time. These will keep you busy and stop you from meddling with your employees' work.
on the tasks you've done rate leverage. How

could yc reduce this?
Write a list of the upcoming decisions you have to make. Choose three and walk yourself
through the six-question approach of management activity #3.
Reflect on where you and all of your reports fall on the Maslow hierarchy of needs.
Make a list of the task-relevant feedback your employees have access to. Determine if
they can assess their own progress.
Determine the TRM of each c r reports (high, medium, or low) and what
management style would be most effective for them. Consider if your management
style matches their TRM.
Redo a performance review ou wrote the , keeping in mind Grove's tips
writing a good review.
or 20 points:
Explain one-on-one meetings to your subordinates, ask them to prepare for one, and
conduct it.
Determine the top three organizational objectives for the next quarter. What are your
key milestones?
Ask your subordinates to determine their key milestones. Then, discuss milestones
together.
Start a competition-create performance indicators so your employees can compete
other.
Reflect on the most recent performance reviews you received and delivered. Consider if
they gave task-relevant feedback or improved performance. Also, consider how each
was delivered.



# My summary

Managerial Output = Team Output = Output of your team + Output of your teams influence = Managerial Activity #1 x Leverage of Activity #1 + ...

TRM (Task Relevant Maturity) = how educated, experience, and mentally ready and employee is for a PARTICULAR task, in a PARTICULAR circumstance.
	LOW: provide structure and strong guidance.  MED:  Some structure, but expect teams to provide some.  Don't micro-manage, exchange ideas & communicate.
	HIGH:  minimal structure.  Don't involve with the work, be sure objectives are clear.
	==> Always monitor the team, regardless of the TRM level.
