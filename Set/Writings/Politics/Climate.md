### 2022-05-06  IPCC draft

RESPONDENTS YOU ARE ASKING PASCAL FOR REFERENCES TO PROVE A NEGATIVE.

Your detractors would like you to prove a negative. To provide a scientific reference that proves there does not exist any reference showing great cost. NOTE: I have skimmed many of their references. No surprise they DO show scientific evidence of effect, and they DO NOT quantify the costs of these effects. (because we don't them very well)

Below is perhaps this is the best reference you might provide. It is a summary from a recent IPCC report (the world leading organization whose mission is to quantify these costs). I skimmed it, and the strongest claim I could find is this over arching conclusion. Essentially it says if we wait, cleanup will be harder later. But it still does not quantify the consequences of not doing the cleanup. From the report:

**Available evidence on projected climate risks indicates that opportunities for adaptation to many climate risks will likely become constrained and have reduced effectiveness should 1.5°C global warming be exceeded and that, for many locations on Earth, capacity for adaptation is already significantly limited. The maintenance and recovery of natural and human systems will require the achievement of mitigation targets.**

Pascal, the only caution I would add, is that while we don't KNOW the costs of inaction outweigh the costs of rapid and dramatic reduction in fossil fuel usage, we also do KNOW they are not. There are some plausible existential threats (e.g. tipping points, loss of bio-diversity, etc.) that could be existential in nature. We cannot PROVE they will happen, but we also cannot PROVE they will not. And they do have a degree of plausibility behind them. So one might argue, we need to suffer the trillions of dollars in economic damage from climate reduction just to play it safe. This stance IS justified, by the science... it is just not what the media tells us.

NOTE TO ANY WHO WANT TO REPLY HERE. If you are going cite some science paper and claim it DOES quantify costs, please cut and paste the relevant claim directly in your response, just as I did above. You will know exactly where the claim is, since you are claiming the paper does in fact have such a claim. (I have looked as many dozens of papers, and have failed to find these claims)



  


### 2022-05-06  David response to the IPCC paper

  
> This is not a peer-reviewed article in Nature or Science.  Does it not count?

  

It does count.  The IPCC is still quite a political entity, so one must consider that angle, still the report feels extremely measured can precisely considered.

Did you gain access to the actual report, or are your conclusions about what that report says based on popular press statements about it?

  

  

  

  

In any case here is the (96 pages) of technical summary of that report.  I did not have the heart to open the 1700+ page actual report!

  

  

[https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_TechnicalSummary.pdf](https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_TechnicalSummary.pdf).   (this is the 96 page one.  It is quite readable, but big!)

  

  

Here is the best summary quote I found of a big consequence, in my short bit of time reading:

  

21.  21  iii) Available evidence on projected climate risks indicates that opportunities for adaptation to many climate
    
22.  22  risks will likely become constrained and have reduced effectiveness should 1.5°C global warming be
    
23.  23  exceeded and that, for many locations on Earth, capacity for adaptation is already significantly limited. The
    
24.  24  maintenance and recovery of natural and human systems will require the achievement of mitigation targets.
    

  

And that is clearly not good.  They are saying, if we don’t act now, it will be more expensive to act later.

  

As I scanned dozens of other sections below this I found many cases where they expressed strong confidence about the existence of an effect, but no confidence, indeed not even a claim about how big or pronounced the effect was.  See the summary table at page TS-10 / TS-11.

  

The definition of low- medium- and high- coloring is not the LEVEL of impact that they effects are having.  Rather this is the level of CONFIDENCE that scientists have that ANY impact is happening.

  

So when I read this, it makes me feel they just don’t have good enough models yet to really pin down the AMOUNT of impact happening.  The are at the stage of just establishing that the effect exists at all!!!!   This is not how it is expressed in the news.

  

  

Now just because this one table does not express the size of the impact, does not prove somewhere else in this report there is a claim of high degree of impact with high certainty.  But I did not find it (in my short exploration).

  

  

Do you see this claim?

  

You seem to believe this report supports that claim, so we should be able to find it…. (And maybe it is there, although I am a bit doubtful since I feel they would have bubbled such a conclusion up into the summary at the top.)

  

Please, tell me what you find.  (This is not me being aggressive… I am interested if it is there!)
