### 2024-04-12  Dillion updates to the plan

Agree on the challenge of reconstitution, in Iraq the US F-ed up by not restructuring.  But Afghanistan is the better analog here, just as with Gaza there really was no strong local pro-israel, pro-US institutions to work with, AND in both cases you have a subset of the population ready to die rather than align.  This position is a non-starter, you can never mold such a population into a partner for peace--they believe Israel should not be there... and for some/many we are not changing that belief.

So I think reconstitution is the only path for a real partner, and further it can only be done slowly within the subset of Palestinians 



- Coalition of nations (not lead by Israel) provide favored trading, direct funding, and governmental setup assistance
- Enclave progressively becomes self-governing and self-policing ultimately becoming a separate state
- Enclave is only populated by those willing to accept Israel and willing to help ensure her safety.

--> Benefits of this path
- Just as with Iraq, it is not possible to setup a government over a population where many citizens in that population are actively against the goals of that government, as we saw in Iraq, this cannot work long term.  My approach provides a path for the subset of Palestinians willing to accept need to keep Israel secure with a path.  
- Segregating by willingness to keep Israel secure allows israel to safely allow prosperity and freedom w/o risking another Oct-7th, trying to give prosperity and freedom to citizens that include many who would do harm is far more risky.  (and I think Israel just wont do it.)
- Over time if the enclave is far more prosperous because of its thriving trade etc.  I think many Palestinians will see it as their personal path to freedom and embrace it and Israel's security too.  (of course those who continue to want to fight Israel to the death will be oppressed by Israel, and she will deny them any freedom to act or grow, just as she does today)

but it is about money.  Today Iran funds Hamas to build hospitals and schools.  Aligned nations need to outspend Iran and build better trade, better schools in the enclave.  If we want Palestinians to favor our path, we need to meet them half way, we cannot allow Iran to outspend us.  And this is a happy situation:  Iran funds the rest of Gaza, but is quite limited in ability to foster trade etc.  And the aligned nations allow great trade and direct funding.  If we cannot beat Iran at this game, we are not trying.  Meanwhile the Gazans on both sides benefit.




### Porto Rican

I did make my comment in good faith, but as you suspected, I am pretty clueless about Porto Rican history or prospects, so I am not surprised (or offended) that you might be critical of my off hand ideas.  (I hope you are not either.)

#1 For me I was not assuming it was political condition, but rather economic.  If a human is born with access to certain jobs, education, and prospects they do better than others who don't have them.  So I (naively?) assumed US access was worth a lot.

If the USA was much worse off than London, I think I would want my kids to have access to London---but maybe I would not, maybe I would not, maybe I cannot imagine not being a citizen of the the big guy, so my ability to predict how I would feel is faulty?  I cannot know.

#2 spot on.  I assumed access to the USA would be a hands down win. if that is not true, well that would change my opinion.

#3 I don't assume it is because it is a small nation of Latinos.  As you say other small nations (like Singapore) have done quite well.  But they generally do it by having something the rest of the world wants, and they have really good set of big guy allies so they don't get shoved around.  (and even this it is still tricky to maintain)

#4 you say the USA would be "propping up" the economy.  Maybe that would be so, but maybe not.  I would not say the USA is "propping up" New Hampshire even though it is a tiny state of the union.  It is tiny, but per capita is cost/benefit is ok.  The same could end up true of Porto Rico.

The big thing is that it would trade much of its unique culture for the US melting pot, just as Hawaii did.  I can understand if that is not your thing... its not an economic argument, it is really a cultural one.  I cannot argue against that, it is really a personal value call.

#5 No question we cannot really look at the past 125 years and pretend the USA did not have dramatic effect--of course it did.  both positive and negative I am sure.  My assumption was based on a very naive view of a generic small island nation w/o strong resources would fair in the world by considering others in similar circumstance.  But I am certain you know many more details so perhaps my generic assumptions are deeply flawed?  I would only caution to not consider the question with rose colored glasses.  (At least if economic prosperity is a critical factor for you, perhaps cultural factor trump those.)





### 2024-02-11  Andrew's response

Andrew, I am enormously grateful for your detailed thoughts.  Here are some response, subject to your available time I love to hear your reaction to them:





THIS PLAN DOES NOT SEEM TO REQUIRE BALANCED SACRIFICES

True.  But Israel holds all the cards, they need not (and have not) made great sacrifices.
My aims are (1) immediate, large benefit for those Palestinians to join the Enclave.  (2) a pathway towards a Palestinian State. (3) with !ZERO! reduction in Israeli security.  Not because that is fair, but because it is the only way forward.

Still it should be noted that this is not a free ride for Israel.  Palestinians live in relative poverty at only 1/10th the per capita income of Israel.  Still its population is more than HALF of Israel's.  So it will not be cheap for Israel (and partners) build a prosperous enclave...  They are not getting off scott free, and they are delivering the thing of greatest immediate value:  prosperity.


BUT WHERE DOES ALL THIS GO?

Suffrage, passports in Israel?  No way.  Israel will never accept that loss of democratic control.  But I need to add to my post to explain the pathway:

(0) PARTNERSHIP COUNCIL:  Creation of the oversight council.  These partners that will advocate-for and pay-for the enclave.  
(e.g. Israel, Egypt, USA, EU, maybe Jordan, UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia)
(1) IMMEDIATE:  Stability and prosperity for Palestinians who join.  Immediate security for Israel.  Immediate payments & favorable trade w/ partners. 
(2) PROGRESSIVE FREEDOMS:  Enclave must prove to the council it can maintain security while increasing freedoms.
- Can it import concrete w/o tunnels being built?  Can members travel abroad w/o committing terror or bring weapons back? etc.
- Of course its not fair that each freedom only comes after proving to safety an external authority who might say no with out recourse.
- But it is much better than now!  Today Israel is the entire council.  And Hamas lives in your enclave, so what chance to you have to prove the concrete will not get used for tunnels.  None!  Its a step forward.  how big?  hard to say, but if the enclave really can ensure security, it will be politically hard for these partners to keep denying freedoms, and why should they?  Security really is the issue at hand.  
(3) STATEHOOD:  Statehood would be granted on a progressive and provisional basis.  At core, the issue is the enclave's ability to govern itself and to maintain security.  As it proved year after year it could do this with stability and strength there would be little reason not to allow it all the trappings of statehood, on the provisional basis that it does not backslide.  For many decades it would be economically dependent upon its partnership council and would still be more like a protectorate than a fully sovereign state.  At a practical level this would make very little difference to it citizens.  They would vote, would have their own fully autonomous government within whatever ....



WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO NEVER JOIN

Those who never recognized the right for Israel to exist, and who fight on for a "better deal" with Israel, e. g. the right of return within Israeli territory, etc. are effectively at war with Israel.  That is their right.  We cannot deny them the right to say "Israel stole our lands and we will not rest until we have them back!"  But barring Allah descent into their midst to make things right, their plight in this fight is quite sad and quite predictable.

Human & Israeli history both show that a us stronger powers never sacrifices its security or territory unless compelled to do so; even when they are clearly in the wrong.  Gandhi and Martin Luther King both demonstrated that democracies cave cave into PEACEFUL protests of their injustices by those who pose no physical threat.  Over time I think the enclave will prove itself to be more effective at securing concessions from Israel (even on behalf of those OUTSIDE the enclave) than those still waging war against Israel.  If real progress is made via this peaceful path while those at war have little to show it will dramatically undercut the argument that armed resistance it the better path.  But this must be shown with ACTION -- and that can only occur with a partner committed to non-violence and security.

One would hope eventually the zealous group would simply shrink down to a tiny core who were willing generation after generation to sacrifice their children's lives in the hopes that Allah will come to bolster their efforts.



TRAITORS / SCABS / SELLOUTS

This group **IS** a traitor to the 




DOES IT STILL FEEL HORRIFIC WITH THE CONTINGENT PATH TO STATEHOOD








### 2024-02-09  Try Number Three

CONTEXT
(1) Israel holds all the cards and will not accept any change that notably lowers their security.
(2) A percentage of Palestinians want to wipe Israel from the map.  No matter what wealth or concessions are given, too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much of a feeling of lands stolen.  For them its nothing less than "river to sea"!
(3) Thus a two state solution cannot work:  either (a) Palestinians must be oppressed so thoroughly that it is difficult to obtain any money or resources to launch an attack, or (b) monitored so carefully that they cannot marshal the resources they have to launch an attack.
(4) While many argue it is a necessary evil, Israel and Egypt are guilty of meting out collective punishment against some innocents by barricading Palestinians.  Here I propose a "way out" ... it is far less than what Palestinians want, but can be offered by Israel and obtain greater security in return.


The key insight is to notice that the choice of peace cannot be offered to the Palestinians as a whole, rather it must be offered as an individual choice with individual consequences.  Greater freedom and prosperity cannot be offered to a people as a whole, if those people as a whole are not committed to non-violence against Israel.  Yet human population is a monolith, if given the choice some (many?) would choose Israeli security in exchange for prosperity for themselves and their children. 

So how might this work?  Each Palestinian family is given a *personal* choice with *personal* consequences: Stay where they are today, or move into a separated “Pro-Israel” enclave within the Gaza territory. Families that voluntarily join this enclave must commit to ensuring Israeli security from attack.  This means a commitment to accepting significant security checking, first from by the Enclave itself, and second from Israel and the international community as well.  With heavy checking, this enclave would be LESS of a threat to Israel than the rest of the territories as it is actively cooperating with the checking required.  The first line of security checking would be managed by the enclave itself.  This lowers costs and also helps ensure that checking is done in ways that preserves dignity and civility.  This first line is also done in tight coordination with Israeli and international community to ensure everything is done rigorously.  Since this entire enclave has committed itself to ensuring Israeli security, these checks become something analogous to the indignities innocent travelers voluntarily accept at an airport in order to ensure the security of all.  It is not exactly the same; it is more invasive and it is done for the security of someone else.  Still it is the type of indignity that one might accept as a practical necessity if the payoff were economic escape from the prison of Gaza.

Many Israelis have told me "This will never work, no Gazan will ever sign up for this!"  I think they are wrong, I think many in Gazan feel hopeless knowing there is no practical path for freedom for themselves, their children, or their children's children.  Given a way out, some will take it and I think once others saw benefit, many would follow.  But regardless if I am correct, simply OFFERING a way out is crucial for Israel.  It shows with concrete, practical action that Israel would be a great friend to all Gazan's who were truly committed to its security.  This would dramatically help Israel around the world and with its Arab neighbors.  Anyone who says. "Israel is not serious about offering peace and prosperity to Gazans" would be proven wrong every day it supported an enclave with an open door policy for all who accept and protect Israel.

Of course there would be real work for Israel, Egypt, USA, and other partners:  It is not enough to provide a hunk of dirt for those few willing to vouch for Israeli security, they must get BASIC PROSPERITY in return.  Good jobs with good trading relations.  This is easier to provide to a population that is actively supporting security, still efforts and funds must be made available.  Iran funds Hamas in (small) part to build schools and such.  We must spend MORE in trade and aid to build out businesses so coming to the enclave really is escaping to a better life.  

The idea is to allow this enclave to start small.  The costs will be low, and our ability to instill a strong sense of ensuring security is built in from day one.  You don't like it, you're out!  Everyone in the enclave understands its very existence and the existence of all those good jobs, stability, and schools are predicated on its ability to police itself.  If it fails in this, it fails to exist.  

Societal groups have a way of building-in self-reinforcing ways of thinking.  Hamas builds a society predicated on hatred of Israel and it fosters that world view.  Native Americans in the USA are often deeply offended by the injustice meted out to them in the past and sometime the present.  Still very very few would support vigilante justice against the USA -- they know how harmful the reaction would be towards their community.  In the same way, and enclave of Gazans whose job, school, and community are all predicated on Israel's safety will be come quite concerned about that safety.  Not for love of Israel, rather for love of their children!  Over time cultures change, just as they changed for the Arab-Israeli citizens today, they can change for those Gazans benefitting from partnership with Israel.

There are many practical aspects of this idea that I have left out.  (e.g. buying the land, managing saboteurs, etc.). I leave those for a subsequent article.  For now I would love to just get feedback about the idea.


Stable governance, good schools, and medical etc.  All supported and guided by the partners.  



---now it has offered a real and practical way out!


It seems the international community and Israel would gladly partner with such an enclave, indeed most everyone would support such a group. Fostering peace would be a simple a fostering jobs within this enclave. As families realized their jobs were only as secure as their ability to keep their enclave free from Israel-attackers, they would become VERY motivated to keep such folks out! I am sure they would not be 100% effective, still they will be much more effective in policing themselves than Israel is today in policing from afar and operating AGAINST the wishes of the people they hope to control. This is a net gain in security for Israel from day one, and it only gets better over time.





Still they do not get their separate state and they must collaborate to ensure the security of Israel, why would any Palestinian agree to this?!  Prosperity.  Imagine your are born in prison and you and your children will die in that same prison.  Some will not be willing to suicide their life and the life of their children to continue the futile quest to destroy Israel---pragmatically they will choose peace and life, even a life with many "airport checks".  Some Israeli's tell me that NO ONE will accept these terms and none will volunteer to join this Enclave.  I don't believe that, but even if it is true, it is our moral obligation to give those that have no intention of harming Israel or support those that do, to escape the endless punishment we are placing upon them and their dependents.  And empty enclave would be proof to the world that the murderous intent extends across the whole of the population.

Instead I think a different thing would happen.  A tiny and prosperous community would form and would live in peace.  It would be a "weird" piece since it requires careful monitoring.  But children would go to school, bakeries would open, jobs are had, lives are lived.  Once the reality of personal life benefits became real and visible, I predict concern over whether the capital was in Jerusalem or such would fade into the distance, as would the desire to blow up Israel at least among those that enjoyed that prosperity.  The flood gates would open and more would want to join this prosperity, accept the required monitoring.

Ironically I also believe this path is the best one for a truly independent Palestine.  Israeli's hold all the cards, and they are never going to allow a separate state if they cannot fully trust the intentions of that state.  No trust, no state.  An enclave built in this way is better than any alternative I can think of in incrementally proving its ability to ensure Israeli security.  Will that work, I don't know, but I know the alternative cannot ever work.




Still some might counter that its not fair that Palestinians should be required to swear an oath to protect Israel and to suffer the monitoring needed to ensure compliance. I would agree, but is seems a tiny price compared with the Palestinian treatment today!

Once this tiny starter group had proven itself capable of carefully monitoring itself, Israel could relax restrictions on this enclave’s travel and it commerce. This, plus international investment, could make the enclave quite attractive. Over time more and more Palestinians might choose to move into this enclave, once it was shown it could be a path to a “post-prison” future for themselves and their children. Perhaps over time the enclave could evolve into a protectorate of Israel. A self-governing country that had all freedoms of other countries except its defense was handled by Israel. 

Some might also counter that Palestinians need violence to be heard by an Israel regarding unfair access to water and many other practical issues. I disagree, since this group is not a security threat Israel cannot use that excuse to limit the group, and their voice would be purer and more universally supported in Israel and on the international stage. They would be _more_ able, not _less_ able, to lobby for real change. Since the founding of Israel, violence has ALWAYS resulted in a loss for the Palestinians.

I have thoughts about how one might manage the buying of land to create such an enclave as well as some thoughts about how to handle groups that would specifically try to destroy such an enclave. But first I thought I might want to get reactions to the idea itself. So… what about a three state solution?


### 2023-12-23  Try Number two -

TL;DR
(1) Israel holds all the cards and will not accept any change that notably lowers their security.
(2) A percentage of Palestinians want to wipe Israel from the map.  No matter what wealth or concessions are given, too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much of a feeling of lands stolen.  For them its nothing less than "river to sea"!
(3) Therefore either (a) Palestinians must be oppressed so thoroughly that it is difficult to obtain any money or other resources to launch an attack, or (b) monitored so carefully that they cannot marshal the resources they have to launch an attack.

Given these harsh realities I propose a voluntary "way out" for Palestinians that provides for near term prosperity and stability.
My "way out" is far less than what Palestinians want, so it will never be accepted by all, rather it is a personal choice made by individual families to opt out of the current conflict.




Here is the nub of the problem: Even if Israel showered benefit and wealth upon Gaza there would still be 1% that would use any new found freedoms and wealth to try to wipe Israel from the map! There is too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much honest feelings of having lands stolen. So Israel is never going to cede security control over these territories---it would be irrational for them to do it will 1% continued to want to kill them.  On the other side Palestinians know that they are prisoners on their own land; they know their children’s children may well die as prisoners on that same land. Without any hope in sight many see crazy-drastic action as the only reasonable response.

Palestinian sympathizers claim if they had prosperity and basic freedoms they would accept Israel as a peaceful neighbor, while those on the other side say the Palestinians never will.  As with all such questions about a large groups of people, the answer is somewhere in the middle: some would trade prosperity instead of a continuing quest to destroy israel, and others would not.  We are all morally obliged to give those who would choose peace and prosperity the option to choose that path, if we can do that in safety.  And we can:



My solution is to give each Palestinian family a choice with personal consequences: Stay where they are today, or move into a separated “Pro-Israel” enclave within their territory. Families that voluntarily join this enclave must commit to ensuring Israeli security from attack by their enclave.

### 2023-12-17  Response to Nadav

Nadav,

I really appreciate you humoring the westerner here. Thank you!

I think there are two key differences with the Oslo accords:

First, among those Palestinians who were given autonomy in 2005 there were many who still promised to wipe Israel from the map, they never rescinded that promise. No surprise, when given the chance they try to fulfill it! I propose an Enclave where membership requires and oath to proactively protect everyone including Israel from terrorism. Some will certainly lie but I think many who willing to agree to the crazy terms of this enclave will not be lying.

Second, I am not proposing that Israel needs to reduce its surveillance in this Enclave. Indeed the prosperity of this area is tied to its ability to keep terrorism out. To join this area one must be friends with Israel, one must accept the need for the very invasive surveillance needed to keep terrorism out of this area. Thus careful surveillance of this area will be easier than the rest of Gaza since it is done with the blessing and active support of its members. Importantly I want to put ultimate responsibility on this enclave for ensuring it is terrorism free. This makes the surveillance more an action impose from within rather than action taken from outside.

It would be at Israel's discretion how the sharing of this security verification occurred. But no matter what, it would be entirely different given a whole population swore an oath for proactive support, and openly acknowledged they were trading need to support Israel's security for their own personal prosperity. If you are not ready to make that trade don't swear the oath. And if you don't follow along, you get kicked out.

You may ask, so what is in it for the Palestinian? Why would any join such an invasive Enclave?? One word: Prosperity. The west and Israel both need to reward those few willing to sign up for Israel's security. We reward proof in action, with JOBS! Initially as this community is tiny, the costs to support it are also tiny. As the community grows the cost of supporting its economy will also grow, but the benefits in reduced security will also grow. And I think the ability for businesses to operate in this region could be greatly enhanced. Part of the prosperity of this area could come from its ability to be more open since it is so heavily and collaboratively scrutinized. Presently Israel must restrict things a simple a concrete into Gaza as they are actively used for attack. Since this community is so much better monitored (by Israel in tight cooperation with Enclave authorities) it is more possible to allow business operations knowing that monitoring is so much tighter.

You may say that no Palestinians will sign up. Perhaps few will initially. But that is fine. This still provides Israel a tiny Enclave where it can prove just how friendly it could be to Palestinians if only Israel's security was assured. And demonstrating this for the west would raise Israel's standing a lot. Israel could point to this Enclave and say: "see, if our security is assured, then we can be quite friendly indeed."

And I think this would be very instructive for Palestinian's too. You tell me as a Westerner I cannot really understand Israeli context---and you may well be right about that. Still I would say it might also be hard for you to wrap your head around the Palestinian mind who explains away Israel's prior offers of peace as not "real". Such a Palestinian has concluded that Israel can never be a friend to Palestinian people. This enclave---invasively monitored---would be proof that Palestinians could prosper as friends of Israel, more would come.

This enclave is not proof that Israel will ever relinquish security control over Gaza. Instead it is proof that Gazan's could have a prosperous life if they were friends with Israel---at the price of having invasive monitoring. That is probably a new thought for many Palestinians, who have bought into the propaganda that Israel intrinsically hates them and hopes to keep them down no matter what.

Whatever this idea is, it is quite different than the Oslo accords. Your thoughts?

### 2023-11-04  published on medium

Presently we are in deadlock: In their hearts Israelis know that some Palestinians want to wipe Israel out and reclaim all it land as soon as they are able. They see preventing Hamas from freedoms that would allow it to grow economically and militarily as an existential necessity. Palestinians in their heart know they are prisoners on their own land and their children’s children may well also die as prisoners on that same land. Without any hope in sight many see crazy drastic action as the only reasonable response.

Here is the nub of the problem: Even if Israel showered benefit and wealth upon Gaza there would still be 1% that would use any new found freedoms or wealth to blow Israel up! There is too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much honest feelings of having lands stolen. And no one can force a Palestinian to not believe their lands were stolen—everyone has a right to believe what they believe (even if YOU are certain that THEY are wrong).

My solution is to give Palestinians a choice: Stay where they are today, or move into a separated “Pro-Israel” enclave within their territory. Families that voluntarily join this enclave must commit to having NO MEANS to attack Israel and swear an oath to personally do their part to create a society that diligently ensures that no one else in their enclave harbors such means or intentions. Its not moral or workable to force such a dramatic commitment upon a person — this must be a voluntary choice. This group would not be monitored from without, rather it would monitored itself from within. It voluntarily arranges many types of self monitoring to ensure that shady stuff is not happening within its midst.

The international community and Israel would gladly partner with such an enclave, indeed most everyone would support such a group. Fostering peace would be a simple a fostering jobs within this enclave. As families realized their jobs were only as secure as their ability to keep their enclave free from Israel-attackers, they would become VERY motivated to keep such folks out!

There is too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much honest feeling of having lands stolen.  And no one can tell a Palestinian youth that their lands were not stolen, when they feel in their hearts that is was stolen---everyone has a right to believe what they believe (even if YOU are certain that THEY are wrong).

My solution is to give Palestinians a choice:  Stay where they are today, or move into a separated "Pro-Israel" enclave within their territory.  Families that voluntarily join this enclave must commit to having NO MEANS to attack Israel and swear an oath to personally do their part to create a society that diligently ensures that no one else in their enclave harbors such means or intentions.  Its not moral or workable to force such a commitment upon a person---this must be a voluntary choice.  This group would not be monitored from without, rather it is monitored from within.  It voluntarily arranges many types of self monitoring to ensure that shady stuff is not happening within its midst.

The international community and Israel would gladly partner with such an enclave, most everyone would support such a group.  Then fostering peace would be a simple a fostering jobs within this enclave.  As families realized their jobs were only as secure as their ability to keep their enclave free from Israel-attackers, they would become VERY motivated to keep such folks out!  I am sure they would not be 100% effective, still I bet they could be much more effective in policing themselves than Israel is today in policing from afar and operating AGAINST the wishes of the people they hope to control.

Once this tiny starter group had proven itself capable of carefully monitoring itself, Israel could relax restrictions on this enclave's travel and commerce.  This, plus international investment, could make the enclave quite attractive.  Over time more and more Palestinians might choose to move into this enclave, once it was shown it could be a path to a "post-prison" future for themselves and their children.  

Perhaps over time the enclave could evolve into a protectorate of Israel.  A self-governing country that had all freedoms of other countries except its defense was handled by Israel.  In the distant future, after decades of little aggression towards Israel, I suspect the international community and some in Israel would pressure Israel to fully release its grip and allow it to be an independent state.  This would not be such a consequential day, since the freedoms that really matter to the average Palestinian all came much earlier.  The price of self-policing seems a price worth paying.

Some might counter that its not fair that Palestinians should be required to swear an oath to protect Israel and to suffer the self monitoring needed to ensure compliance.  I would agree, but is seems a lot fairer than Palestinian treatment today!  Some might also counter that Palestinians need violence to be heard by an Israel that is not fair with access to water and many other practical issues.  I disagree, because this group is not a security threat Israel cannot use that excuse to limit the group, and their voice would be purer and more universally supported on the international stage.  They would be more able, not less able, to lobby for real change.  Since the founding if Israel, violence has ALWAYS resulted in a loss for the Palestinians 

I have thoughts about how one might manage the buying of land to create such an enclave as well as some thoughts about how to handle groups that would specifically try to destroy such an enclave.  But first I thought I might want to get reactions to the idea itself.  What about a three state solution?



Over even longer time perhaps this group could develop better feeling towards Israel as their plight improves and Israel's boot is not so firmly on their neck.

### 2023-10-18  THREE STATE SOLUTION


What about a THREE state solution?

Imagine if Palestinians were given the option of moving to a separated part of their territory where ALL residence had also signed up to a commitment of having NO MEANS to attack Israel, and a commitment to self-police that no other residences in this area had such means.  Some voluntarily choose to live in this area, in return for access to externally supplied jobs and safety from attack from Israel.

Would Palestinians swear an oath join this area?  Could they successfully self-police others in the area so it generally did not pose a threat to Israel?

If such a region could be created, it seems it would be in Israel's interest that the population of this separated region would grow. And over time if this area was free from Israeli attacks and has jobs and freedoms, why wouldn't more Palestinians join it over time? Is this an incremental way out?

Thoughts?
### 2023-10-15  Both Isralies and Palestinians are justified in their hearts.  Thinking out loud: I propose a THREE state solution.

How can both sides be justified!?  Unlike logic, one side having a strong justification for action does not preclude the other side from also having a compelling justification for action.  At the end of this article I provide an argument many find compelling that concludes that no matter how Israel frees the Palestinians it greatly increases risk of large jew fatalities.  On the other side provide an argument that Palestinians have no hope and no way, thus precipitating rage and violence no matter its expected futility.

So what is the problem in using a two-state solution to solve this?  Some Palestinians fervently believe they should fight until Israel is gone.  Any gains made would embolden more aggressive future moves.  They really would not be satisfied until they had somehow won it all.  Likely it is only a small faction and a much larger group just wants to live a reasonable life.  But even among those who do not adhere to this thinking many still have very significant sympathies with that thinking.  Building a two state solution on this is fraught as long as part of its populace would use new found freedoms (and monies from Iran) to strike at Israel. Further, a two state solution is trying to force a people into a new opinion on a core belief---this just never works.  Some believe Israel should not exist, we must accept this is true, we cannot force a change here, we can only to provide them with a better alternative and see if over the decades they change their own mind...

Thinking out loud, I propose a THREE region solution: 
The first region is the state of Israel, the second is the occupied territories, and the third region is a proto-state carved out of the occupied territories.

Here are the core tenants of this proto-state:
- To be a citizen of this proto-state you must accept and support:
	- The idea that non-violent protests/actions are superior to violent one and will yield better results with Israel.
	- Complete and total condemn all violent actions for political ends in all cases.  (even if Israel were to act heinously)
	  ==> Notice: such a person need not accept Israeli action, they simply believe the response that will yield best results are non-violent (but potentially dramatic) ones.
	- this proto-state will actively precludes itself and its own citizens from having any means to harm Israel.
	- this proto-state will actively support Israel's abitlity to verify lack its lack of military abilities.

Those who join this proto-state need not believe that Israel is correct or justified.  They, like Gandi before them, believe having an iron-hard will, combined with a strict and total renouncement of violence will move mountains that violence itself could not move -- it will lead to a more prosperous state for its children to live in.

This is a very personal belief, it could be wrong, and it cannot be forced upon a person.  Thus membership in this proto-state would also be voluntary, each family can freely choose to live in the proto-state or outside of it.  Now it is up to Israel and the west to make living inside this proto-state preferable to living outside of it.

Of course Israel can do this by making life outside such a state a living hell, and in many ways they already DO make living in Gaza a kind of state wide prison.  Still it does not make sense to push people too hard to join the proto-state, this will just overwhelm that state with many people who do not freely accept its peaceful tenants.  My thinking for this proto-state is that it should grow slowly filled with people who are strongly committed to non-violence as a means of change.

My thinking is that such a committed non-violent group will have a larger voice on the international stage than Palestinians have today.  Their voice would be a purer one, one that could be accepted without reservation by nearly all groups.  Over time, I suspect they would win larger concessions from Israel than other Palestinians could win by other means.  They might even win concessions that apply to ALL occupied territories not just for their proto-state.  I think they could win more international investment as well.  In trade they gave up their right and their ability to physically defend themselves from Israel.  

Time would tell if their path would be the more prosperous one.  But if they managed to keep extremists out of their ranks year after year it seems hard for Israel to justify many restrictions upon them.  Indeed why would Israel care to impose restrictions upon them?  



.  Thus families opt to join this 


This proto-state is predicated on the belief that a population dedicated to the safety of Israel as a core part of its condition for existence will be a far superior partner for Israel that one who had not.  And 


The first two regions are Israel
