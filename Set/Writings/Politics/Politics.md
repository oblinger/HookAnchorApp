### n2021-00-00 - ARE YOU INFORMED OR ARE YOU MANAGED?


I have a thought I have been chewing on thought for a bit.   See what you think...


There are two kinds of information sources:
— those that primarily seek to inform you, and
— those that primarily seek to convince you.


It is easy to tell the difference between these two:
— A source intent on informing you will present information in ways that highlight both support and opposition to any simple overarching world view (e.g.  small government is better, left is better, right is better, pro-business pro-union, etc.)
— Imagine a weather channel that is always highlighting the fact that is it not snowing in Dallas.  This might be true, but it's not news.  News is something that goes against what is expected… it is “new”-s
— So any outlet that that frames every story as always supporting or always opposing…… ANYTHING.  Is not primarily a source of news, it is a source of propaganda.  It might be factually accurate propaganda, or not factual, but either way, the aim is clear — it primarily aims to persuade.


I guess there is another possibility.  Perhaps where is a world view so perfect and so complete, it is such a perfect explanation of the world, there are no exceptions or special cases to report on.  Of the hundreds of millions of human interactions each day there simply IS no contrary information worth reporting.  Yeah, and I have the hot tip on how to buy in on this bridge being built...


So here is my maxim:

If you don’t have info sources you trust and listen to which regularly highlight examples that challenge or contradict your core beliefs, you are not informed … you are managed.  

Now of course not everyone really wants to be informed and challenged, I get that.  
Either way, it is just good to know where you stand.




What ya think?

And they were upholding the decision of a fourth Republican, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann, a conservative jurist and Federalist Society member. Brann had called the campaign’s legal case, which was argued in court by Rudy Giuliani, a “haphazard” jumble that resembled “Frankenstein’s monster.”

In Nevada on Friday, Judge James Todd Russell in Carson City ruled that attorneys for Republican electors failed to provide clear or convincing evidence of fraud or illegality.

Nevada judges are nonpartisan. But Russell’s father was a Republican governor of the state from 1951-59.

— U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten in Georgia, an appointee of President George W. Bush, rejected a lawsuit alleging votes were manipulated in favor of Biden, saying “they want this court to substitute its judgment for that of two-and-a-half million Georgia voters who voted for Joe Biden and this I am unwilling to do.”

— U.S. Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas, a former law professor appointed by Trump, wrote, “voters, not lawyers, choose the president. Ballots, not briefs, decide elections,” as his panel refused to grant a request to stop Pennsylvania from certifying its results. 

### n2022-07-22  - Religious tolerance

This seems an issue of legitimate disagreement in this country.
Some honestly see same-sex couples as a natural and healthy thing.
Others see it as unhealthy and evil. Which group on earth is qualified to determine who is right?
An honest question: Shouldn't we be working to have Christian schools that don't discriminate, and others that do? It seems wrong to me, for the government to force the opinion that same sex IS moral. By forcing all religious schools to adopt a specific practice we are effectively having the government take a moral stance here.
NOTE: it seems very reasonable that the government ensure that there are Christian schools available that are same-sex affirming. after all 53% of the population is in favor of this, so it would be wrong to have a coalition of Christian churches block other churches. But it seems just as wrong to have a government lead coalition.
This note is not intended to be confrontational. I am honestly questioning this.

### t2019-00-00 - Ryan (Baltimore school teacher)

Ryan,
Thanks for taking the time to respond! If you don't mind indulging me further, I would love to get your critical assessment a bit further. It is remotely possible that some action might even come from this thinking…
My aim is to NOT spend (much) more money per student, yet partially address this issue. The not spending more money part is the hard part of course, but if it is solvable, then it has a greater chance to be implemented.
The idea is to have:
(1) a SINGLE bootcamp school for an entire city the size of Baltimore. So even though the cost per student per day is much higher than a traditional school, since we only have ONE, the city-wide cost per student is negligible.
(2) to make this happen, students have to actively and dramatically NOT want to go to this school, so even for a difficult student, they actively choose to avoid being sent there. (If they don't mind going to the school, then we run out of room at our expensive school.)
(3) the central (proposed) benefit is that as a teacher you can require a basic level of cooperation and if they can be placed in detention at your school. If they don't comply you can escalate at any hour of any day to their immediate transfer to this school, just for the night, or for a week.


As I see it, the problem with suspension and detention is that they are

### n2019-00-00 - CONSEQUENCES in the classroom
CONSEQUENCES.
It seems to me that in our effort to have "no child left behind" we have gone astray. But I wonder your thoughts on the matter, you might not agree.
We correctly note that when we suspend a student, prison other legal actions, chances are higher that they will fail in life. From this we conclude that we should minimize these corrective actions when we can.
My theory is that this is not a good path. Seems to me that we all need consequences tied to actions as a way of shaping behavior. And failing to have consequences early on, allow behaviors to become progressively worse.
That said, it seems we should have (1) certain, (2) compelling, but (3) temporary consequences, so one can learn. It also seems that our lack of rigorous enforcement of consequences on a few, has significant impact on many within those same classrooms.
So as I imagine it, we would have rigorously enforced, quick response, quick relief consequences.
But you are living it, in a Baltimore public school, and I am not. Tell me what you think:
We both know suspension damages education, so it is best avoided. What if instead of this we had a "bootcamp" school. The cost per student per day is probably 4x the cost for a normal class. The students have therapists on staff, and strong physical controls with pretty limited interaction with other students. No TV, no 2-way Internet. Significant physical chores each day, as well as their daily lessons captured via smartphone from their classroom.
My idea is that this place would be LESS FUN than most any other life choices, and so it would be avoided at all costs. Any student that repeatedly ended up in this spot, likely has strong enough emotional problems, that they inadvertently end up there. So those students need specialized theraputic help.
In my imagination, have such a "low-damage, quick fix" at your fingertips would be transformative in your classroom. You would just say: ``billy, sit down now and be quiet, or you will spend 1/2 hour after class on extra homework.'' …. he knows from experience if he does not stay after for his extra homework, he will spend a week in bootcamp. He knows this with CERTAINTY, that this will be his consequence. Its just 1/2 hour, but if he does not do his 1/2, then his WHOLE NEXT WEEK will be no fun at all.
How many times do you think he will need to learn this lesson? Many others will learn of this CONSEQUENCE by just watching what happened to Billy.


So I know the purpose of your post was very much a heart felt quandry about very real choices you are forced to make. Sorry for high-jacking your post to ask this question. But you are the right one to ask.
Would it work? Would it be good? Would it transform your classrooms?
Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

### n2019-00-00 - selection bias in science

https://medium.com/p/fab3a09409ad/responses/show

My Context: not quite a believer in God, nor a non-believer either.


Ella, as usual your piece is well written, and conveys the Anthropomorphic concept well. As I consider the assertion in the text: ``that these coincidences *force* scientist toward the multiverse model'' it occurs to me:
Science can never really provide insight onto the question of the divine.
Science has an unshakable bias towards naturalist explanations - science itself has a strong selection bias. Thus its successes in finding naturalist explanations, and its failure to find evidence for anything else merely reflects the selection bias of science itself - this outcome is not necessarily a reflection on reality.
That said, I am not trying to bend this into some kind of God proof. What it is, is dramatic proof of the unshakability of the scientific bias (which of course has empirically served humanity quite well.)
interesting read

### n2019-00-00 - THE TWO CHOICES (politics)

FELLOW DEMOCRATS, WAKE THE EFF UP !


Mathematics dictates that each party has exactly two choices:

(1) Craft a message that resonates with a winning majority of electorial seats.

(2) Whine and moan from the sidelines while others lead.



In 2016 the Democrats chose option #2 and Trump chose #1 -- that is not my opinion that is historical fact.  

As we head further left we dig deeper into #2 -- folks that's not my opinion -- that is simple math.

       *WAKE*  *THE*   *EFF*   *UP* !!!   



So what should we do?
1. Focus!  Only talk about issues that appeal broadly to all Americans.



### n201--00-00  The Future #2 - no jobs

I find pieces like this quite frustrating. You assert: we don't have to chase "talent," we can have pay parity... and profits won't suffer. I promise!

I agree with your worries, but pretending that dynamics which CAUSE these problems are not there is pointless hand wringing. Like basecamp we hire rarified talent, and treat them well -- you have to if you are going to keep them!

But here is the reality check for you: the jobs (like basecamp) where one person's output will impact 1M+ other people are mathematically going to be rare. And these markets are winner(s) take most all. This is the nature of knowledge work. And with automation/robotics/AI the remaining physical work will continue to have less and less monetary value.

Knowledge work is an inherently unstable business. It reinvents itself at an astounding speed. Winners get more profit then grow faster, and win more. They grow to permanently dominate their area, until it is disrupted. The main areas for growth are new ones where no one has yet established dominance... and the race to gain that dominance in those areas is FIERCE. Only the luckiest, talent-est, hardest driving have a shot at that dominance, the rest will dwindle. This is the math of reality my friend, as much as you feel it morally should be different, it is not.

For me the more troubling trend is the reality that we have physical work which is loosing value, and knowledge work is tending towards greater concentration. (e.g. 1 human impacts more and more others). Thus the percentage of the population that are strong financial contributors drops.

Capitalism was just not built for this situation, and humans were not built to have no job.

But back to your article.  It is frustrating because it purports to aim at a solution and has not even identified the problem correctly (in my opinion).

### n201--00-00  The Future

The core problem that is killing / will kill the present economic system:

TALENT.  

MULTIPLIERS.  I define a multiplier as a person whose output noticeably benefits 1M+ other people in a way that they are willing to pay for over the course of a year.  For example a well known, or strong football player might affect their team to a degree to drive game sales for 1M+ people within a given year.

In the past multipliers were rare, and the fraction of the GDP paid to mulipliers was tiny, but several trends (aggregation, automationm, robotics and AI) are driving the to a point where multipliers will dominate and ultimately destroy the current economic system.

This analysis is a bit simplistic, but it gets to the root of the current shift:
Automation and aggregation are increasing the multiplication of the people remaining within certain industries.  At the turn of the last century a single farmer could only grow the food for several, now it is several hundred thousands, and the trend only accelerates.  Distribution and manufacturing are on similar trajectories.  The result is fewer people needed and outputs increased.

The second trend AI and Robotics replaces human labor with capital -- the capital needed to pay for the AI and robotics.  This also reduces the number of non-multiplier jobs available.  

The only counter trend to this is a craftsman or service trend where a premium is paid specifically for human labor itself.  Either because the human labor is in some way still superior to the automated alternative, or it is just the luxury of having another human wait upon you.

But the fraction of the GDP paid to the non-multiplier crowd will drop without limit as automation replaces humans as the most effective solution for most tasks.

This will yield a three tiered society: multipliers, servers/craftsman, and unemployables.

Now how do we run such a society?  The multipliers will easily make 100x more than servers do, and the unemployed make nothing?  The present system would leave one group dead, the next group desolate earning a few percent of the GDP, and the top group making all the money.
