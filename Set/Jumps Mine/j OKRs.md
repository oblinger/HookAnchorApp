## OBJECTIVES
- **PAID AI** - Accept 3 videos and optional metadata (batting lineup & outfield positions) as input, and produce a list of plays.  Each play lists start and stop time for the at-bat along with pitcher and batter ID.
- **AI IP** - Differentiated SV IP.  1-3 Patent applications, Full-AI POC(s), Core capability innovation (OCR, obj reco, homography, IDs, ...).  
    Infrastructure.  Turnkey: visualization, metrics, dispatch, deploy, build
- **AI SPEEDUP** - Reduce total annotation time for an important market segment by > 25%.
