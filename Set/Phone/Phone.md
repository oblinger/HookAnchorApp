### 2022-12-03  Thumb Tack TV install

I have purchased a mantle-mount system for my 42" LCD TV.
I want it installed over my fireplace with only a power cord connection needed.  The installation is very generic.

The only challenge is the power.  The fireplace is an island in the house w/o any power on any part of that island.  I am assuming one would need to run electrical by going thru the basement ceiling. 

The first photo shows the location above the mantel where it would be installed.  The next two show the back sides of the fireplace island, and the final photo shows that area in the basement where an electrical connection might be dropped thru the ceiling.

How do you typically get electrical to such a TV?

### 2022-10-07  Lily - Tax Info for 2021 return

Wells Fargo 844-656-0360

Lily,

  

Here is the info as requested.  We did not make any payments this year, but I did make a 60K & 15K payments (I think that is the amount)

When tax day came, just so I would cover any taxes and not get into trouble.  (But no payments were made prior to April 2022).

  

I am not positive if the Wells Fargo statement I have is the correct one.  Let me know.

I have screen shots of house payments, DMV and Tax preparer payments attached.

  

I still have a home office in the same configuration as last year.  But I did very little 1099 work, so I don’t know if I can deduct anything for the home office.

  

  

IMPORTANT DETAIL

- I had a differed comp plan associated with my own sole proprietorship which was terminated in 2021.  Since these funds were kept under my name at Vanguard, they are STILL under my name at vanguard. 

- Perhaps I need to notify Vanguard that these funds are now not in my DC plan, but are just back in my IRA?  I am not sure… the funds aren’t really moving.  But I should be careful since the IRS cares that the funds always remain in a qualified account.  Exactly what actions do I need to take in this case?

- Also I did receive $2000 of 1099 work in 2021.  (This was important for allowing my differed comp plan to be adjusted in a way that avoided it being imbalanced when it closed.  This work was done for my Mom, so I don’t have any 1099 to go with it, but we should report the income as 1099).

  

  

Thanks,

Dan

      **WD95991116**  I purchased a GE microwave less than 30 days ago.  It was installed by Home Depot's 3rd party vendors, and it mostly works.  But every 4-5 days all of its LEDs will light up briefly, and then it resets itself, and needs the clock reset as if it is the first time it is powered up.  No other appliance in the house is having power issues.  I would like to have the microwave replaced with a fully functioning one.  Thanks.

Subject: Poor warrantee service by Nana Home Services

I expect more from GE.  You should reconsider your relationship with Nana Home Services.
I am having an issue with my new GE microwave, and you dispatched Nana to take a look, after some initial confusion (that I think was GE's fault)  the technician had a valid work order.  They use a web app and text messages to coordinate the worker's visit.  But something is very broken with their work flow.  Twice I received *confirmation* text messages asserting that my visit was scheduled, and thus I rearranged schedules in order to be available for the window in which the work is occurring.  TWICE I simply received a message requesting confirmation of a different time.  No explanation of what has happened, no phone call.  Just a new scheduling.

On the third time I was getting this scheduled, I grew frustrated and requested to talk with someone at Nana.  It seems they are too busy for this.  Carmela "thanked me for reaching out" and just told me "be a good little boy and please respond to the third scheduling by their Technician Edmar Michael"

Wow!  I don't allow others to treat my time as so irrelevant.  For me it is precious.

I will think twice or thrice before purchasing another GE appliance.  You should think twice about Nana.

#### C Review

We did a 4-day trial with Carolina for a full time Nanny position.  It did not go that well, partly for reasons outside her control.  But we did learn some things of relevance for others.

MESSY.  In her own words, she is messy by nature.  She claims that she can organize and be clean professionally.  We found that messiness does show through in her execution.  Examples:   Each day as she cooked her liquids would boil over on the stove, and she did not clean them without explicit request (she said she was going to clean these the next moring).  I called some of her references who also said the needed to clean after her at times.  She left a soaking wet dirty cleaning towel under sink on top of toilet paper.  

ATTENTION TO DETAIL.  There were many small examples of just not  paying attention to details.  Not putting the cap tightly onto a water bottle before putting it into the stroller.  Forgetting things like keys and phone etc. frequently.  Leaving a room heater on in a room with all windows open.  Not setting her alarm clock so she wakes for work.  Leaving things out, leaving the stroller directly in front of the front door so it cannot open.

SAFETY.  One or two things seemed somewhat unsafe.  She returned with our baby and started putting him in his carrier onto an unstable surface -- I cried out before she let go, but it did not make me feel safe.  The main concern around safety stems from the attention to detail.  Her heart seems in the right place, but I worry that something bad could happen by accident.


INTEGRITY.  I gave her $100 to buy groceries.  Asked her to buy "soft scrub" to clean tub.  She bought a body scrub.  When she left she took it with her.  When I confronted about this she said this was a confusion.  Ok, but if this is a confusion, then why take it with you? 


We hired her for Nanny work, and for reason beyond her control she was not really able to do that work.  Still for all of the reasons above we became less comefortable to even let her try.

### 201--00-00  Sleep question
-- 200K 3%

Nick, 
I am that guy.  reads all the sleep blogs, CBT class, eye-mask, ear-plugs, all the gadgets too.  My sleep is not terrible, but if I wake after 3-4 hours, oh god help me!  Even before I am fully conscious I am already thinking.  Many exciting projects in my world, and a few mild anxieties too.

I try put a boring topic front and center in my mind... with marginal success.  I try not to even go to pee as my chances of going back to sleep plummet.  After 30 min I am unlikely to make it back to sleep, so I get up.

Its tricky to take something to get back to sleep at that time.  Occasionally I will work for 2-3 hours, then fall back a sleep for 2 hours or so.  (essentially segmenting my night's sleep.)  If I do that early in the day, I will be sleepy again at night, but it is not time-efficient to have segmented sleep.

My sleep drive is plenty to GET to sleep.  but too weak to ensure I stay asleep and/or I just have too much going on so that waking up becomes a bigger issue.


How do I GET BACK TO SLEEP?

### 201--00-00  Garage door project
Daniel Oblinger:
	Is this Home Depot?
38698:
	Thanks for messaging with The Home Depot. Message and data rates may apply. For more information text HELP, to opt-out text STOP. Privacy Policy and full Terms at https://corporate.homedepot.com/privacy-policy
Daniel Oblinger:
	I have a question about selecting the correct garage door spring.
38698:
	Hello! My name is Susan and I'll be assisting you today. With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?
Daniel Oblinger:
	This is Dan
38698:
	Hi there Dan! Did you have a specific question about selecting your garage door spring, or just need help figuring out which one you need?
Daniel Oblinger:
	I think I need to choose the correct torsion spring
	Mine has some grey or white spray paint on one end.
38698:
	https://www.homedepot.com/p/DURA-LIFT-0-218-in-Wire-x-2-in-D-x-26-in-L-Torsion-Springs-in-White-Left-and-Right-Wound-Pair-for-Sectional-Garage-Doors-DLTW226B/302333485
	Does that look correct?
Daniel Oblinger:
	Yes, but is that the only spring with that approximate color?
38698:
	Yes, white is it's own distinct color, so this would be what you'd need. The white indicates that it is a 110 pound spring. The next closest colors would be tan, yellow, or light blue, which are still all going to be fairly distinct from the white.
Daniel Oblinger:
	How heavy is the light blue one?  (Just to be sure that is not it)
	And what does it cost for delivery of the spring?  (Thx)
38698:
	Light blue is 190--it's actually the highest weight option.
	The link I sent is for the pair of springs, and it has free shipping!
Daniel Oblinger:
	Thanks, but I am confused.  The link you sent is for one that is rated at 188lbs.  That is almost exactly 190!
38698:
	If you'll allow me just a moment, I'm actually going to see about grabbing a supervisor, because my knowledge on these is limited, so I want to verify I'm giving you the best information. Please bear with me.
Daniel Oblinger:
	Sure!  Thanks!
38698:
	Thank you so much for your patience. I apologize, I was slightly off on what I was telling you, so I'm glad we checked. The color represents the wire gauge/thickness, which does directly impact weight, but is not the only factor we need to look at. 
White IS the color you have--I'm going to send you the official PDF from the Commercial & Residential Garage Door Division so you can see all of the colors--I'm still saying white is the only one close 😃
	However, that is not the only information that you need to base your choice on.
	https://www.dasma.com/PDF/Publications/TechDataSheets/CommercialResidential/TDS171.pdf (Colors on page 4)
	You also need to measure the inside diameter and length of your existing spring. I'm going to send you another link that shows you exactly how to do that.
Daniel Oblinger:
	Ok
38698:
	The other thing this link is going to talk about is the wind direction. We sell them in pairs, so you'll have one of each wind direction. You just need to make sure you are putting the correct spring on the correct side.
	https://idcspring.com/measure-order-torsion-springs/
	https://www.homedepot.com/s/white%2520garage%2520torsion%2520spring?NCNI-5
	This is a selection of different lengths, all in the 0.218 gauge (white) wire.
	You can purchase only one and replace one side, but just like with tires, you're going to get the best performance and balance by changing both sides at the same time.
Daniel Oblinger:
	Got it.  Ok thanks!
38698:
	Also, they did recommend, if you haven't changed torsion springs before, that you definitely look up a few tutorials on youtube to familiarize yourself with the process. It is a relatively simple process, but can be a bit tricky, and can also be dangerous if you don't exercise a few precautions.
Daniel Oblinger:
	Thanks!
	Does Home Depot partner with installation experts?
38698:
	We certainly do! You can go to this link to get more information on service for your area. https://www.homedepot.com/services/c/garage-door-opener-repair/ee5eda8e1?vfrom=search-results
Daniel Oblinger:
	Thanks so much for carefully answering my questions!   (This has been my best Home Depot interaction)
### 2018-00-00 - coinbase
HELP!  It has been almost a week and none of your account recover processes are working:

-- I no longer have the phone used to set up this account   415-656-6182
-- I do have access to the email and password.
-- I do have the google validator
-- I can send a photo of myself
-- I still have control of the account used to initially fund the account
-- I wrote at the beginning of this week that someone might be trying to access the account since someone tried to setup a bitcoin remittance accont in my name.  I don't know if this is connected.

Over and over my support tickets are closed (even when I am NOT trying to login for 48 hours)

I have no place else to turn!!!  I am trying to follow all paths, I don't know what to do!

### 2016-00-00 - Aeolus notes

picker/sweeper
 close doors
 hazzards (avoid spill, poop)
 animate tracking
 safety stuff done



RECO
 -- better/faster pose/reco
 -- fit onto a TX-1
 -- door knobs
 -- reco of special non-ridgids: e.g. poop, power cord, liquid
 -- Animate detection


 -- reco for grasping.






         INT:  Pos Ctlr
Roj      INT:  Arm Accuracy Test
Milutin

-- amazon:  pill box, laptop cord; bead cover; endust

-- how do we catch up to based on lossages.
-- what will be deliver by end of month.
-- how will we avoid having this kind of gap in the future.



fix phone calendar to include aeolus events
GOLD ROOM -- confluence setup for base ports etc.
gold owner
git owner
place where the test is run. where are the camera.

Hiring
-- ONE OF A KIND:  Security, SafetyTeam, Mgt guys.  in Europe.
-- Q/A, sys eng, integration team
-- Roboticsts
-- Vision guys
-- Hiring team.
Notes
Less 

Rough guess new job 25% less.
After all deductions then is only 10% lower than Aeolus
Benefits that more than make up for this:  
-- unemployement insurance
-- retirement benefit.  plus a lump sum. <<
-- paid health insurance  <<

-- paid vacation
-- 1-month of "extra salary"

Not so easy to find companies that pay full benefits -- with a reasonable pay.

.....
was Thinking about the future.
did not seem so worried about us being a startup
did want to work as a C++ but that is not the primary.
was frustraed with himself that he couldn't get others to support him as he needed to get work done fast
......





Dont have base driveing; dont have object reco; dont have arm transforms and arm calibrated well enough for use.

DEMO PRIORITIES -- should focus on demos in this order
(1) Stuffy Bump
(2) Base explore
(3) Collision Avoidance
(4) Grab vac pole



BASE IDEAS
-- Can we move Felipe move to 100% supporting base sensor integration?
-- Could planning team members help with travelling salesman debugging in base?   (Balasz?)

COLLISION AVOIDANCE IDEAS
-- Woitech could support 3D occupancy work for base demo
-- Could move Filip, Mulutin  to collision avoidance (or Slawomir Maybe)?   this could free up Sahil, but could damage collision avoidance.
-- Jose works 100% supporting demos (perhaps collsion avoidance?)   (we think he is almost 100% now)

OBJECT RECO IDEAS
-- Theo: maybe work fulltime on Reco, and achieve max velocity getting reco on stuffies
-- James Chou could work directly w. MIT to get object reco working in Taiwan (skipping SF step)



 



#### Todos
-- Tell Rafael to call Alex.  resign
-- DECIDE:  w. Brandon are they sending the correct 
-- DECIDE:  Rogerio to Taiwan?
-- People Slide:  Name Education Location Lane specialty (tagline)
-- After Action:  After action post mortum.
-- When do we get Alpha platform tests
-- Mocking the GEE for unit testing.  talk w. Filepe, alexeyz
-- ask brandon would Dung be better in taiwan
-- list of employees (including contractors)
   split by AI / vision / robotics, etc.   also list swim lane
-- Check: do we have good patent coverage for Patient for N^2     

CTO
-- build org
-- road map
-- shooting the moon.
   build robot medical system.... whole system is robotic... and see the way.

#### After Action
-- Need reliable way to contact people.  Brandon while walking around.

-- VPN -- one person being the gateway & need second person access -- temporary access


#### Jeff Roles

-- Organizational/cleanliness tracking (JIRA, swim lane plans, repo, )
-- Rescource planning  #people, #months, across tasks.

-- Performance reviews
-- Scheduling meetings, 

#### After Action

EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY TO TAIWAN
-- Certain time we are not getting responsivness.
-- Other times we are sending slack / JIRA request, but no response
   thinking that receiver is not sure what to do, so does nothing
   --> Tasking priority is not clear.
-- Responsiveness must be significantly upgraded.  (these are early days but...)

-- More Testing should be driven from Taiwan
