Recruiter

Can you recommend a specific recruiter or two that would be a good fit for my experience?

I am an AI/ML/Robotics PhD-3exit-CTO; I lead $200+M in R&D as PM at DARPA, and built three 50+ engineer orgs in SF.  I am Looking for an Advisor or Leadership role in a company centered on novel AI-tech.

Thanks in advance for any pointers
Dan
