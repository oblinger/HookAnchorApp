Subj: Lunch

Aniket:
Last time we ran into each other on the street we talked about grabbing lunch.  I would love to set that up!  Especially since the sale of my company is well underway, and recently I had the novel idea of becoming an EIR/advisor that supports multiple startups within my specialty.  Your firm is likely not a right fit for me, still I would love to get your insight into the viability/value of that path.

If your schedule still permits it, shall we pick a place on cortland and a day to meetup?  

Thanks,
Dan

Subj: virtual coffee

Amy,
It's been a DECACDE since our DARPA days.  How did THAT happen?!  I have been keeping myself busy in Silicon valley.  I am on my third exit (... in process of selling my 40-person cleantech/AI company).  I see you have been working more the science & venture side of innovation and done quite a few things in that time too.

Recently I have been thinking about the idea of working with multiple companies rather than getting neck deep into one of them for years at a time.  I wanted to get your opinion and advice about this path from you since you are very very near that sapce --- more on the venture side, but still very technical.  And of course it would be awesome to catch up too.

If you have time for a virtual coffee I would love it!

Thanks  --Dan

p.s. happy to send my resume if you want to see it before recommending

Looks good

My feedback:

— I think “managing X millions of AI research as a darpa pm” is more compelling than “managed X spend” without context. (Normally people don’t talk about spend in that way, when coming from commercial context, they would say something like managed X number researchers, or generated y revenue, or a company that raised z funding)
— I don’t know about “before getting pulled into the acquiring company”. It’s begging for questions to be asked. less is more might be better. Eg something like “ I just sold it. Now I’m deciding what to do next”….
— i think it’s important to mention what you are interested in. This is partially so that people can connect (no one likes a soulless mercenary) but also to note leave it all to their imagination where there would be a good match. The clearer you can be, the easier you make it for them, the higher conversion rate you will get 
— generally, you are a very good advisor. It wouldn’t be the worst thing to start advising companies, start building a network, then let yourself get pulled in at a senior level. You could say you are looking for CTO or advisor roles related to X
