#### Title
- Exponential Edu Corp uses one's future success to obtain the connections cash and training needed to achieve that success. 

#### Problem
- What problem are we solving?  The disadvantaged need what the rich already have, the connections cash in training to make to succeed.
- Simply giving loaning money fails.  The set up and the incentives are all wrong.
- Nobody's in the trenches with you.  Unlike the rich uncle with a business, your competitors are not trying help you, but rather to beat you!
- Opportunities are squandered because they're not earned.
- Loan officers lacked local knowledge; loans aren't paid back because it is to some nameless third person
- Resources aren't cared for because they're not owned.
- Nobody has enthusiasm because they don't even know if a job will exist for them when done.
- And whole system is not scalable since even if against all odds someone succeeds, that success does not drive future successes for others.
- UGH!   Edu Corp has a contractually-mandated "pay it forward" mechanism that solves ALL of these problems.  Ok, so how?

#### Vocational School
- It's a vocational school that's owned by the senior cohort of students.  And there are 2 junior and 2 freshman cohorts too.
- The school is organized around a running business, it employs peer-to-peer apprenticeship teaching, along with online video material.
- On graduation day, the junior cohorts sign loans to form a new corporation and to buy the school the senior cohort.  One cohort becomes the seniors at the school and the other joins the new business.
- The newly ranking seniors then must recruit two freshman cohorts to rebuilt the school, and this process is repeated as a way of pumping out a stream no newly form businesses.

- Notice that the resources are protected because they're owned by the senior cohort who bought it with their loan, and can only sell it onward if in good condition.
- You are guaranteed a job because you are a part owner of the company that you will work for.
- And its scales indefinitely since each corporation is bought using its future income.

Lets let's talk for a moment about those graduation day loans

#### Secret Sauce
- Incentive alignment is the secret sauce of Edu Corp.   It allows decision making to be driven down to the level of those with boots on the ground in a way that I think is magic and I think novel too.
- Here are the two Junior class cohorts one will cosign in order to buy the school from the seniors, while the other is cosigning in order to split a create a business with the seniors.  
- By the way, they don't know which is which, so they're actually negotiating the terms of the split without knowing which cohort is going in which direction.
- This is important because it can be complicated, maybe the business is going to get a head start by taking a few clients from the school maybe it'll take an old tractor with it so they're going to negotiate how these details are split apart, and how things get paid for.

- Each person needs to have five cosigners, one inside their own cohort and four from upper class cohorts.
- This is really important:  
	- it's a much stronger guaranteed the loan will be paid back with 4 cosigners that are all part of other businesses that are cash flow positive.    (friends loan)
	- this man's gonna get payback because successful business owners all of these must be successful before this loan is approved or already running businesses so they already have a cash line to pay back your loan and 
	- its the best possible loan officer, they're not gonna go sign if they think you're a bozo and you're not gonna succeed, or they might make you delay six months until you're really ready; these loans will be much stronger than a normal micro loan because these guys have knowledge of the person and knowledge of the situation.
	-  and I need to pay forward if you're going to get this loan you're committing to signing close any loans for future generations that's the way the system works

	- the seniors are focused on running the school 
	- the juniors are focused on splitting things up finding a location for the new business and setting everything up and 
		- it's very flexible the way that the loan amounts and such our structure because every new business situation is going to be unique and someways but 
	- Notice how this co-signing puts 4 upper class persons in the trench with you since they have cosigned and lose money if you don't succeed this means they're really gonna help you
	- It also means you have a network of profitable businesses doing what you're doing that have an interest in helping you do it too.
	- And it is a reality check too.  If you cannot get 4 upper class persons to agree to co-sign your loans, then you are automatically kicked out at the end of your freshman segment.
	- And once you agree to co-sign someone, this becomes a very personal relationship.  The under class person needs to keep their sponsor feeling good about doing the co-signing, and the upper class person will want to help aim this person for long term success.  Your going to want to help that person and
	-  make sure that they're going to be there and that you're gonna want to cosign when the day comes so it really ties people together in a way that existing systems don't do I think it's also much wiser than micro loans because basically when the day comes to sign you know this person intimately and you're making a thumbs up or thumbs down decision on whether or not you're going to cosign this loan for this new business or they are to buy the the thing
- 
-  out countries in 
- 
- The last portion of this is war how does this phone system work was forcing it to keep going there's a nonprofit it's kind a franchise models central nonprofit 
- 
- It's a trusted third party that owns nothing, takes no risks, and gains no profits--students take all risk and rewards.
- It's the adult supervision: providing legal, accounting, and business training and services.
- If you think about it we're taking a group of strangers who have never owned a business, or indeed may never have had a real job before, have them all sign multi-year loans for expensive equipment all in their name...what could possibly go wrong???
-  oh my God I'll kinds can go wrong in so you don't supervision is there to make sure that somebody doesn't take accounts receivable and you know hop out of town but also make sure that basically the business are being run reasonably priced a decision making really is happening with the students on it they're just kind of making sure that something shifty is not happening the other key thing that the central nonprofit is doing is R&D this thing is like a cancer it's going to keep producing businesses until there's so many businesses that all of them fail because they've saturated the market that's no good so the central nonprofit needs to look at the marketplace and understand how many more businesses within this Geo of this kind maybe we need to move to a different year or maybe our clients just need to be coming from a different nation depending on what businesses they do the research on us and figuring this out in the wedding incentivize the existing schools showing here they create thoughts here they're trying to grow the number of purple corporations they're already reach saturation on the green ones they want to stop that and they want to start the yellow liquid five billets continue purple continue purple double purple clothes green and switch to yellow and the thing is it's much easier to just be one of these guys that continues why would I want to take a risk on of making of duplicating the school to create to do schools as crazy I wanna do that and why would I want to continue switching over yellow when I'm just gonna like terminate and I'm just gonna become a corporation that's as much easier so that's a nonprofit everybody kind of says how much they're set an a profit sets a a dollar amount it's a zero sum game so this group this this school will pay a lump sum loan paid out over some number of years to the school because this one took the easy way out and this was taken a tough way same thing here these guys are going to pay this one so it balances the needs of a larger system and it also balances the number of new corporations as long as the R&D is good we don't saturate our markets that way and everybody is fairly compensated for the difficulty or easiness of what they're doing so basically if you're in a good position you're charismatic you've got good connections in there in the community sure I can I can actually recruit for two schools and find work for them so pay me money for taking them at risk I'll do it with somebody else is no way no it's the other thing there's no specific timetable for this matriculation school here it's running well but he can't get customers he can't recruit new students very well this one is lined up to succeed it's all been done boom boom boom it is turning out corporations like nobody's business and this is just as you wanted to be the the ones which are in hot places they turn out more businesses these are less likely to fail in more marginal circumstances the tree slows down so most corporations have high performing parents because the way the tree grows very last idea and here is the forward loan the whole idea if you are required if somebody cosigned your loans you are required to cosign if you sign up for this you are required to create two schools but no good plan survives first contact with the enemy so that might be what you thought you're gonna do but now it turns out that there's a recession is a terrible idea and doubling the school is going to be terrible but you sign up for it and you got benefits for doing it well if you're going to fail to live up to your obligations like this guy is a bozo and I don't have anybody else to cosign but I don't want to cosign this guys long well that's a good sign that probably we don't want that long to exist at all right so we don't want you to be able to not cosign the loan but we want but we don't wanna make it easy otherwise your bitch uncle sounds so the forward long is what you pay if you don't do what you were obligated to do according to the system so you committed to recruiting some people you committed to quitting school if you don't do that you pay your forward now this allows the boots on the ground to make the right choice either thing or you do the thing that drives the thing forward once you pay the forward loan which is used to offset the costs of new training materials or the risks of moving into a new market so you're gonna pay it forward one way or the other either by cash or by actions so that it's very nice way of enforcing that pay by the pay it forward system without being oppressive I think this is better than micro ones it's the best mechanism you have best friend cosigners so your loan officers which are really the cosigners are the most knowledgeable people about you much better than the microphone system and you're much more motivated to repay it's not a name was person that you never met your reneging on your on the pussy and helped train you for years to do this also having profitable businesses as cosigners dramatically reduces your cattle risk the cattle going into the system is much stronger it's gonna get paid back almost certainly because he's got four cosigners that are in profitable businesses what are the chances of all four of us got you know go belly up before you can pay off it also drive success because he's profitable businesses are in the best position to help you be profitable and it's more than money you're getting I guess it's templates and training it's a lot more than just a microphone vocational school you got a guaranteed job you've got ownership of the assets the school doesn't get trashed because it's your stuff it's getting trashed and the pure teaching is motivated in a much stronger way because these are people you're gonna cosign on you really want them to know what you're doing because if they don't you're gonna pay 

WHAT'S THE CATCH
- So what's the catch?  This all sounds too amazing so gotta be a catch in there somewhere.  There are two:
- It takes a special kind person.of stupid I mean this is kind you need somebody who is motivated ambitious also going to wash out the system so you need to have people like that in modern ambitious people they can succeed in lots of circumstances so why sign up for this thing and an obligate yourself to pay it forward when you can just go to your rich uncle and just get it done what you want so I need ambitious people without options I think such people exist but I need them I need a special kind of business possible if I do magically give you the connections in the cash in the training I boost your profitability so much you can repay all the loans I needed to give you that cash and training so that the system works and needs to be repeatable I need to be able to couples are adaptable template that I can turn out many businesses maybe they serve different nationalities maybe they are located in different Geos maybe they are doing different crops but they need to have some commonality that the system can be built around it so I think this really is the catch that needs to be understood and it's really why I want to talk with you

### m2014-06-02 Random meeting notes

- type of buisness:
  "one" person buisness -- e.g. selling solar power for lighting.  or phone service. etc.
