#### Title
- Exponential Edu Corp uses one's future success to obtain the connections cash and training needed to achieve that success. 

#### Problem
- What problem are we solving?  The disadvantaged need what the rich already have, the connections cash in training to make to succeed.
- Simply giving loaning money fails.  The set up and the incentives are all wrong.
- Nobody's in the trenches with you.  Unlike the rich uncle with a business, your competitors are not trying help you, but rather to beat you!
- Opportunities are squandered because they're not earned.
- Loan officers lacked local knowledge; loans aren't paid back because it is to some nameless third person
- Resources aren't cared for because they're not owned.
- Nobody has enthusiasm because they don't even know if a job will exist for them when done.
- And whole system is not scalable since even if against all odds someone succeeds, that success does not drive future successes for others.
- UGH!   Edu Corp has a contractually-mandated "pay it forward" mechanism that solves ALL of these problems.  Ok, so how?

#### Vocational School
- VOC SCHOOL - It's a vocational school that's owned by the senior cohort of students.  And there are 2 junior and 2 freshman cohorts too.
- ITS A RUNNING BUSINESS - The school is organized around a running business, it employs ***peer-to-peer*** apprenticeship teaching, along with online video material.
- JUNIORS - On graduation day, the junior cohorts ***sign loans*** to form a new corporation and to buy the school the senior cohort.  And the cohorts split -- One cohort becomes the seniors at the school and the other joins the new business.
- RECRUIT - The newly ranking seniors then must recruit two freshman cohorts to rebuilt the school, and this process is repeated as a way of pumping out a stream no newly form businesses.

- RESOURCES - Notice that the resources are protected because they're owned by the senior cohort who bought it with their loans, and can only sell it onward if in good condition.
- JOB - You are guaranteed a job because you are a part owner of the company that you will work for.
- SCALES - And its scales indefinitely since each corporation is bought using its future income.

Lets let's talk for a moment about those graduation day loans ...

#### Secret Sauce
- SECRET SAUCE - Incentive alignment is the secret sauce of Edu Corp.   It allows decision making to be driven down to the level of those with boots on the ground in a way that I think is magic and I think novel too.
- Here are the two Junior class cohorts one will cosign in order to buy the school from the seniors, while the other is cosigning in order to split a create a business with the seniors.  
- BLIND SPLIT - By the way, they don't know which is which, so they're actually negotiating the terms of the split without knowing which cohort is going in which direction.  This is important because it can be complicated, maybe the business is going to get a head start by taking a few clients from the school maybe it'll take an old tractor with it so they're going to negotiate how these details are split apart, and how things get paid for.

- FIVE CO-SIGNERS - Each person needs to have five cosigners, one inside their own cohort and four from upper class cohorts.  This is really important:  
	- CASH FLOW POSITIVE - Much stronger than a micro loan since the parent business owners must be cash flow positive before the loan is approved, so their co-signing guarantee will have significance.
	- BEST LOAN OFFICER - And these upper class persons are the best possible loan officer, they know the student and the local business context better than any loan officer, and their PERSONAL cash is on the line.  They will only sign up for a good bet!
	- ALIGNED - Notice also once they do sign, they really have your back.  They will pay extra attention that you are not falling thru the cracks during training.  They are in the trenches with you.

The Roles:
- The seniors are focused on running the school, teaching the underclasses.
- The juniors are focused on splitting things up finding a location for the new business and setting everything up, and 
	- Notice the flexibility in this loan structuring; every new business situation is going to be unique in someways but if the business case is strong, the upper class persons will co-sign.
- Upper class must have under class they have agreed to co-sign before they are allow to graduate, and Freshmen cannot progress until they have 5 co-signer who are tentatively committing to signing the future graduation day loan.
	- This system provides very powerful and very personal mentoring within the system, you have your cohort and you have your co-signers, both win when you win, and loose when you loose.
	- After many months of tireless help, you will not want to let them down.  
	- It is also a reality check, if you cannot get upper class people to tentatively agree to co-sign your future graduation day loans, you cannot progress to be a Junior, you are asked to leave and a replacement must be found.
	  It is warning sign that interpersonal trust is not there, and/or trusting you with a large loan and share of a business could be problematic.  

But what requires any upperclass person to agree to co-sign anyone?  The Central Non-Profit.



THE CENTRAL NON-PROFIT
- The schools and businesses that have not yet paid off their loans are actually a student-owned franchise of a non-profit called "Central"
- It's the trusted 3rd party ensuring everyone plays by the rules.
	- It's trusted because it has no skin in the game, it owns nothing, takes no risks, and get no profits.
- It provides "Adult" supervision.
	- Ensures contractual obligations are honored, and more generally just keeps things running smoothly and honestly.
	- If you think about it we're taking a group of strangers who have never owned a business, or indeed may never have had a real job before, have them all sign multi-year loans for expensive equipment all in their name...what could possibly go wrong???  Oh my God all kinds of things can go wrong!  One student leaves town with two months of accounts receivable, poor business choices, not paying back loans, etc.  
	- So central controls key bank accounts, accounts receivable, etc.  Until loans are paid off.
	- It also provides legal, accounting, and business training and services.
	- It provides the training wheels for these businesses until they have experience themselves.

Central's other key function is control.
- Every exponential system is like a cancer, left on its own these schools would keep producing businesses until there's so many businesses that all of them fail because they've saturated the market.
- That's no good so the central nonprofit continuously monitors each marketplace within each Geo and each client nation, to assess how many more businesses can be supported.  
- Based on this they create a number of "billets" that exactly matches the number of schools, that correctly modulate the whole system.
- In the example shown here, Central wants ramp up purple businesses, ramp down green, and start a new yellow kind of business.  
- So they create five "billets":  continue purple, continue purple, double purple, close green, and switch to yellow.
- The schools choose the one they want, if two schools want the same billet, then a zero sum payment is attached which will flow to other schools over a fix period of time.  These payments are adjusted until each billet is wanted by exactly one school.
- In this way everybody is fairly compensated for the difficulty or easiness of what they're doing to 'pay it forward'  
- Again the system incentives, but then lets those with boots on the ground make the right choices, so if one school has charismatic leadership, in a good position to recruit and later help new businesses find business, then they can take on the risk of creating a second school with more recruited students -- and they get paid big time for the extra work and risk.
- Same for simply converting your school into a business vs. creating a NEW kind of school, or starting the same school in a new country, and learning how to do the new tasks with your under class persons.  Much higher risks, so you are paid for it.
- Notice: there's no specific timetable for when graduation day happens.  Each school is a business, and it can run as one.  But if it struggles to get customers and it can't recruit new students very well then it must wait until all conditions are met for its new corp loan.  While another school might be lined up to recruit students and customers like crazy, boom, boom, boom, so it is turning out corporations like nobody's business.  And this is just how we want it, marginal schools with marginal ability to grow customers are more likely to create failing businesses so that part of the tree slows down, letting others parts grab students and customers.  In this way most all corporations naturally have high performing parents because the way the tree grows.

The last piece of the puzzle are the FORWARD loans.
- The whole Edu Corps idea is to 'pay it forward' -- but what stops me from getting my corp and then just never co-signing or helping others?  The "Forward" loan.
	- This loan is also signed on graduation day, but it is 'optionally' paid instead of completing your paying-it-forward commitment
	- What is all your underclass are bozos, and you think the businesses will fail.  We don't WANT you to co-sign that loan!  We want you to use your best judgement.  
	- But we need to put appropriate incentive in place, so you will take some modest risk in co-signing.  Indeed by setting the forward loan size, Central is able to carefully control the levels of risk it is asking for.
	- There are also Forward loans the entire school can pay if it decides it cannot follow thru on the billet it selected.  Maybe there is a bad recession, and now starting a business is a bad idea.
	  Fine, you can pay-it-forward with a loan amount, instead of a new corporation.  Accurate setting of forward loan sizes ensures that everyone is incentivized to 'pay-it-forward' but also with a safety valve if that is not longer a smart move.


BENEFITS


WHAT'S THE CATCH
- So what's the catch?  This all sounds too amazing so gotta be a catch in there somewhere.  There are two:
- It takes a special kind person.of stupid I mean this is kind you need somebody who is motivated ambitious also going to wash out the system so you need to have people like that in modern ambitious people they can succeed in lots of circumstances so why sign up for this thing and an obligate yourself to pay it forward when you can just go to your rich uncle and just get it done what you want so I need ambitious people without options I think such people exist but I need them I need a special kind of business possible if I do magically give you the connections in the cash in the training I boost your profitability so much you can repay all the loans I needed to give you that cash and training so that the system works and needs to be repeatable I need to be able to couples are adaptable template that I can turn out many businesses maybe they serve different nationalities maybe they are located in different Geos maybe they are doing different crops but they need to have some commonality that the system can be built around it so I think this really is the catch that needs to be understood and it's really why I want to talk with you

### m2014-06-02 Random meeting notes

- type of buisness:
  "one" person buisness -- e.g. selling solar power for lighting.  or phone service. etc.


- idea from Stephanie (german) 2014-06-02 play game w. 15 different types of people to
  see how it works.
  - each human plays ten people, each in a distinct starting position (e.g. has working business)


- System are inefficient because middle men have power and individuals

- Access to banks  -- so they buy cattle

- ddressing finacial --- 

- labor
