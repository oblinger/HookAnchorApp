TAG LINE:   Relax!  If you're not having fun, its means you're trying too hard...

It's the most devious catch twenty-two, in order to find it one really can't be looking too hard.  < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < >  Hey I'm new to the NYC area and I already love it.  I've been hiking in the Hudson valley, catching many shows, rollerblading all over the city, jumping around to the music at several of the clubs here, and doing more museums than my poor feet can stand.  I am definitely still a newbie here though---real New Yorkers love the city too, but they try not to let it show on their faces.  :)   < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < >  I still have 1376 characters left...  Hmmm, let's talk about me some more.  THE BASICS: I just finished up my Ph.D. and now work at IBM doing research on how technology can enhance primary school education.  I'm 5'10", 165lbs, physically fit, clean cut.  I like to play dress up, but in that not-trying-too-hard sort of way.  ADJECTIVES THAT BEST DESCRIBE ME:  Positive/Energetic -- The first to want to go out and the last to want to leave.  Optimistic/Trusting -- The one people seem to tell those secrets that they have "never told anyone before."  Ambitious -- Enjoy pushing myself, and get a bit restless when life's groove get a little too deep.  Thinking -- if I know about it, I have an opinion and if don't know about it then I want to.  < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < >  Wow your still reading, please someone give her a shiny gold star for perseverance.  I really tried to put is much of me a possible into these lines, but the truth is, once you've read ten of these blurbs they all start sounding alike.  So make your best guess, if you see common ground here drop me a note.  If we do find common ground perhaps we will meet for a quick coffee, go rollerblading, or see an exhibit.  I find life and my day-to-day activities are so much more interesting when they are peppered with the occasional new acquaintance, and well, you just never know...  right?
