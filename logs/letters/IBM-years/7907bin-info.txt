I have some concern over this position's compensation.

The cost of living in Westchester County is one of the highest
in the nation, 

Is there flexibility in the positon's starting salary?



while not totally out of line

once you consider cost of living the other offer would be

is even less copetetive 

than offers I have 

then is does get out of line 


most of my offers fall within a fairly narrow salary range.  And most
of them seem to have upward flexibility in the salary, but I don't
really want to waste time exploring that flexibility unless there
is a very good chance of accepting that offer.




I rally appreaciate offer but


what can we do to make offer more competive 

how high can do you feel is appropriate?

A) wait
