# - ARGUMENT OVERVIEW -

This entire paper is a single interlocking argument outlining (1) how the development of AGI will unfold, (2) what humanity can and cannot do to affect this unfolding, and (3) what actions we suggest might be considered.

We aid the reader in keeping track of this large argument by breaking it down into more than a dozen sub-claims that each require significant analysis to support their justification.  Each sub claim is indicated by a two to three word phrase in ALL CAPS.
...

Certain parts of the argument are much more speculative than other parts.  Presenting them as a whole can potentially weaken the entire argument since the reader is left unclear about which is which.  By default the text is assumed to be coherent and well supported.  In certain cases we indicate **high confidence** in cases where the arguments are more iron clad.  Conversely we use the terms probably, possible, likely, etc. in the manner as expected.  And label certain sections as **speculative** in cases where certain ideas seem indicated, but we lack confidence that they must be true.


As a kind of roadmap for this argument, we provide a skeleton here without any justification for its many claims.  Instead this skeleton is to show how the various parts fit together, and to give a flavor of where the entire argument is headed.

# - LIKELY PATH -
- Top down arguments like Ray Kirzweil's analysis of AGI timelines based on moore's law have the advantage of being generalizations that at least appear to apply to all (or a wide variety) of bottom up approaches one might take toward AGI.
- Bottom up analysis have the virtue of being more concrete and potentially more precise since they are committing to a specific framework for achieving AGI.  But they also could be wrong if there is some other faster/better path to AGI.
- Still here we adopt a bottom up approach because of it specificity, and because we believe we can argue persuasively for the merits of each key assumption our bottom up approach makes.

# - META OBSERVATIONS -


## STEPWISE - Progress Is Discontinuous
- Relatively tiny key algorithmic idea blossoms into an entire field's worth of advancement


## DISTRACTORS - Much of AI "advancements" are distractions


## ALIGNMENT - Alignment Is Doomed To Fail

1. Instances of THE PATH cannot be aligned.
2.
