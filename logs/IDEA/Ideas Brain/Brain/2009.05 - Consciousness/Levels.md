Levels Of Learning Capability

DEFINITIONS
SYNTACTICALLY CLOSE – a concept is syntactically 
UNIVERSALLY DEMONSTRABLE (UD) – A class is universally demonstrable if for all elements there exists some instruction path that achieves that element.
PRACTICALLY DEMONSTRABLE (PD) – Most elements of the class will be learned in benign social environment:  generally suited for learning, with knowledgeable agents observable executing relevant knowledge, and willing to answer reasonable number of questions.


CORE INDUCTIVE PROCESSES

NOTICING – Compressive learning
•	PROPOSITIONAL – d 
•	TEMPORAL – d  
•	RELATIONAL – d 

RELATIONAL –  Can learn each of the following
•	REIFYING RELATIONS – d Can learn “blue car”
•	RELATIONAL SPACES – Can learn chess piece at position X, Y for arbitrarily large relation spaces.  (this eliminates grounded representation thru enumeration of the cross product)
•	RELATIONAL ABSTRACTION – Can learn new relational structures based on pattern of expected pattern of instance collapings

BIAS ADAPTATION – Given any sequence of related learning task, { Ti }, one can get learn to be nearly optimal at those learning tasks.

BASE UNIVERSALITY – If something is expressible in terms of known features, this guarantees there exists some training regime to replicate

BIAS UNIVERSALITY – There exists 


INDEFINITE COMPOSITION – d
