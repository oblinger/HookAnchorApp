### --- PROBLEM ---

- The n-squared device control problem

- Sub-problems we solve
	- Truck Roll -- onboarding and maintaince of the control device is not their problem its ou
	- Secure Registration -- 
	- Installation -- mobile app with adaptive feedback walk thru
	- Diagnosis & Repair -- 
	- Tech support -- 
	- END USER APP -- End user skinned app for monitoring and control of their assets

_
#### -- THE N-SQUARED DEVICE CONTROL PROBLEM --

- INDUSTRY >> HARDWARE
	The ways that energy assets are being used evolves faster than the energy assets themselves wear out.
	e.g. new ways of optomizing HVAC, Batteries, solar, grid interconnect, etc.
	are all evolving faster than the HW it is built on, which typicall has a 20 year life
	- Thus adding new controllers onto legacy HW systems is an important and ongoing problem

- MANY CONTROLLERS -- The ecosystem is fast evolving thus there are not yet winner-take-all leaders

- MANY DEVICES -- There are multiple device categories, then dozens of manufacters per category, and dozens of device versions from one MFG still in the field today to be controlled.

_
### --- SEGMENTS ---
- VPP Customers -- 
- Building owner -- 
- Individual home owner -- 
- Private Equity -- to control legacy assets they purchased
- Automotive


### --- VALUE PROP ---
- TURN KEY --
- CONTAINED -- 
- FULLY OWNED -- 
- LOW COST --

**A LA CARTE FEATURES**

HARDWARE SECURITY -- Secure compute core used to hold secret

FIELD CLIPS -- switches come with removable connectors already plugged in.  Initial installation connect power and other things to these connectors, this way ongoing maintance of the device itself can be done by mail and w/o a trained technician (just unplug broken one and plug in new one)


_
#### -- Registration --

CELLULAR -- Cell phone app reads QR code on device to gain one-time ownership of device.

WIFI-ONLY -- Wifi only require SSID password.  Provided by audio and physical reset switch.

HUB-SLAVES -- Slaves are registered to hub, at factory and also by physical connect to hub.



_
#### -- Installation Wizard / Diagnostics  --

- MOBILE APP BASED -- Installation wizard 

- SKINNED PER CLIENT --

- CUSTOM MEDIA CONTENT

- CONDITIONAL TREE -- content structured into tree

- INTELLIGENT WIZARD -- Senses device state and connection state in order to drive setup

- VISUAL TECH SUPPORT --
