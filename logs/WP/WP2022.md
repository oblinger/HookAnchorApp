SCOOTIFIER 2000 -- The 3am Brain Zapper

In the evening I fall asleep with the simplicity of a dog, I close my eyes and I am out.  But God help me, if I wake at night!  I can loose an hour or two before sleeping again.  Sleep With Me has really helped!  Over the last three years I have optimized my scoot setup turning my results up to an 11.  As a public service I thought I would share...

For me the key is to stop any emotional thinking in the first SECONDS after waking.  Thinking for even a handful of seconds about some everyday anxieties or excitement about a projects is enough to give me just a tiny bit of adrenaline ... which will keep me awake for 15 minutes.  Plenty of time to do further thinking.  You see where this is going...  I found the trick is to intercept that thinking in the FIRST 30 SECONDS.  Then I almost always fall back asleep in minutes.

So:
- zero MOVEMENTS.  Ideally I don't even sit up in bed.  Just back to sleep.
- zero HUNTING in menus to set podcast to turn off after an hour, etc.
- zero LIGHTS.  No bathroom lights, no i-pad backlight as you fiddle with podcast.
- zero SETUP each night (which you will often forget to do)

How?  
- Two "LC-Dolida  bluetooth Sleep Masks"   (one is always charging)
- "Quies" Ear plugs (modestly better than other foam plugs)
- 1-liter open-top container of water
- The free version of the "Player FM" podcast app
- A "bedroom only" i-pad or old wifi-only cell phone that you can dedicate to this purpose.
- Blue-blocking nightlight for the bathroom.

Usage:
- BED TIME:  Put on the sleep mask to sleep.
- 3AM WAKE:  Don't move... press the center button on your forehead, and long press the button on the right.
     now a single episode of scooter will play and auto shut off at the end.
- PEE TIME:  First get scooter playing to distract your brain, then it is safe to head to the bathroom.


THE DETAILS

Your thinking.  For me, it is pretty easy to use the podcast to avoid any angsty thoughts.  But if I am interested in a project I will often reason that it is ok, maybe even useful to think about it a little bit while heading to the bathroom.  BAD IDEA.  You need to be disciplined in the first minutes after waking.  This is your magic time to get back to sleep.  If that fails, ok then maybe do some thinking or such since now it will now be an hour or two before the sandman returns for sleepy time.  It pays to be disciplined in the first minutes.  So hit the scooter play in the first seconds when you wake, then go pee.


The podcast app.  I went thru more than a DOZEN podcast apps before I found "Player FM".  This free app is the only one I found which can be setup to only play a single episode then stop.  All others require you to trigger that functionality ON EACH EPISODE.  Ugh.  I really don't want to be fumbling with my bright screen in the middle of the night.  
- I use a different podcast app for general browsing, Player FM only has one podcast in it (Sleep with Me Patron feed).
- Just disable "continuous play"  and "Use bluetooth to navigate current track" should be disabled by default.
It does take a bit of practice to learn how to change volume, switch episodes, etc.  Do this first while looking at the screen, then later you will be able to do it w/o looking at the app screen at all.


Paetron feed.  I pay for the $5 month ad-free patron feed.  I want to do my part in supporting Drew and his team's full time work.  And I want to avoid any ads during that critical 'back to sleep' window.  Often the first minutes of the podcast are the only ones I actually hear.  (HOO-fucking-RAY for that!)


The headset.  Many bluetooth mask-headsets are similar, but I have found this LC-Dolida (which is pretty cheap) to be just a little bit better.  The electronics stay in place a little better so the buttons are more easily clicked since you can find them.  The rubber on the outside is prominently raised, so your fingers can easily find where to press.  And the build quality of the mask seems just a bit better too.  I have two, so one is always charging.  Nothing is worse than having scooter poop out before you are sleeping!  With only one mask, now you have nothing charged!  (I swap masks on Monday and Thursday so they remain charged.)


Night light.  I used to think the movement to go to pee was waking me up.  Not really true.  It is the thinking and the blue lights.  Even a few seconds of blue wavelength light has been shown to drop our melatonin levels for an hour.  A blue blocker night light is an easy fix.  I like this one since it has a dimmer that can get down to 5 lumens which is perfect when you eyes are adjusted for night.  If I am sleeping off schedule, and it is sunny out I DO NOT REMOVE the eye mask even to pee.  Perhaps I will one day win a Darwin award for some interesting death associated with my walking to the bathroom with a face mask on.  But until then I will have slept well.  Definitely sunlight (even for ten seconds) will crush any chances at sleep!


The ear plugs.  I don't use these everyday, but if there is even a TINY bit of noise that is possible, it is best to just put them on.  Often you will be waken by a noise, but not know this happened to you.  (I have used a sleep snoring recording app, and realized sometimes I had been awoken by a loud car that was gone before I was conscious).  You can put the earplugs UNDER the mask and turn the volume up to full volume.  You will hear scooter thru the ear plugs.  Quies are EXPENSIVE and only a tiny bit better than regular foam plugs.  Still I reuse them many times before they are funky, so the cost is modest.


Ok, I admit it.  I have an engineer's penchant for optimizing the ever living snot out of things.  True that.  Still, this is a rare example where my over optimizing nature might have actually paid off.  Thought I would share.

sweet dreams












Perhaps I am a bit of an over optimizer, but in this case I think it has paid off
