### 2021-09-25 - GOV wild west + serviceland


Against my better judgement, here let me write up the gov taxation scheme I (might) favor:


The country is split into at least two taxing groups (but could be more).
— One is call the “Wild West” and the other is “ServicesLand”
— Both groups pay a conservative set of shared services (like military, but not education nor healthcare).
— Both groups pay taxes for their municipal services which may or may not include education, etc. (depending on what that county particular country has voted for).

WILD WEST
— As you might imagine folks who have elected to be taxes in the Wild West have very little other taxes (or services)
— they can use private hospitals, or service land hospitals for a fee, or for future garnished wages
— their kids can go to private colleges, or service land colleges, but are force to live in services land, until they have paid enough taxes to cover the cost of college.
— They can live w/o the taxes, but if they have not paid for some really good insurance they could really end up in some rough spots.

SERVICES LAND
— In services land you pay your taxes and you get many socialized services.
— The big difference is that taxes are mostly take out as a SALES TAX with INCOME-BASED rebates.

By itself a sales tax is quite regressive.  I counter this in two ways, first the services provided by the gov are less focused on the rich, since they don’t need them.  And secondarily sales taxes are heavily rebated based on ones income level.  Ones first 15K of purchases have no tax.  After spending some 300-600K then you hit the highest sales tax bracket of 50% or so.

The reason for the weird (and hard) taxing system is that it protects services land from rich people who leave to the Wild West to escape taxes.  If they make money buying and selling to others in the Wild West, more power to them.  I have no desire to get a cut of that action.

BUT if the majority of America chooses to live in services land, then we need to take care to ensure they cannot just create super cheap products based on Wild West labor that does not pay taxes, and then undercut businesses whose employees live in services land.  Because it is a SALES TAX, the businesses in services land are not at a disadvantage.  Anytime cheap products are brought in from the outside they are all given a sales tax like all others.  


Will finish this later!!



It is possible that business in service land would actually operate at a modest advantage.  Their employees need less salary to pay for healthcare and education since those are free.  They will pay taxes when they buy, but those taxes will be paid no matter who they buy from.

This scheme would eliminate loopholes for the rich.  They will be paying a hefty sales tax that more than doubles the cost of that yacht no matter who they buy it from, or what money they use.  It would remove incentives to offshore stuff as well… since it does not avoid taxes.


But most of all it would lower the temperature in our country around the “correct” way to govern.

Hey you wanna Libertarian wet dream:   Cool, here it is, just sign this paper!   But that choice comes with consequences!

What I like most, is that this system is not one size fits all, and it does not try to make a single moral choice for all citizens.  Each citizen chooses for themselves the kind of world the want to live in.

One challenge to my thinking is this would provide a safe haven for the very rich to just get richer.
But richer off of whom?

~-~~

A big challenge is that folks that live hand to mouth might feel pressure join the Wild West so they could keep more of their pay, but then they really get screwed later when they need services.

The services land services should be purchasable in an a-la-carte way, if they need them in a pinch.
And if they cannot pay, then future wage garnishing could be used.
Finally, one should always be able to rejoin services land at a moments notice.
Of course services land will need minimize costs of people coming back right at the moment that they developed a serious illness, or have a kid about to go to college.
But these things can be handled by either limited services provided, or have the person pay future taxes to cover.


Leave services land and returning should not be PUNITIVE, but it should sting enough that folks don’t use this path as a way of dodging taxes on services they will later use.  One should be financially better off if one just stayed… but it need not be a ridiculous penalty… just enough that folks only go that direction if they emotionally WANT to live separate from the gov, and based on ones own efforts.

The present system forces us to choose one approach for everyone.  This is a travesty.
And leads crazy elections, and crazy thinking.  If those libertarians/republicans had to REALLY give up their medicare and social security I think many could come back with tail between their legs.

And those that did not, well they could live as they want.  (I think many in the country side would indeed opt for much lower set of services, and much larger private insurance…. And that is fine….  Since we use sales taxes when they sell their services we still get that tax money needed to run the service land services for its members…



Anyway, I shouldn’t have spent the hour on that… but it WAS fun. :-)
