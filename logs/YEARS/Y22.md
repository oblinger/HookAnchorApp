### t2022-04-11  Letter for Lawyer Mary to send to Cara at R-Zero about a Loan to James


Cara,

Dan Oblinger, in his personal capacity, would like to provide a loan of $2000 USD to James Briones.  James was hired by R Zero as part of the purchase of Analytics Fire assets.  We believe this action is not restricted in by Dan's agreement with R Zero.  Still, both we and Dan thought it prudent to get explicit agreement on this point before proceeding.  Let us know if you have any concerns regarding this loan.

Thanks, 
Mary
