Ok Josh so here is a dream that will make you want to kill yourself:

I dreamt that I was somehow travelling from university to university, or from one professional conference to another.  I think I was going back to school or such since I had some kind of final exam take home project thing that was slated to take days to complete, and I had come to the university where you were.  We were talking and you were explaining that you were thinking about getting a PhD in computer graphics.  So as usual we were hacking together in some public space on campus... and you were explaining that your advisor said,
oh well that is good, we should be able to get the PhD in, in about 20 years or so, so you have time.  I was a bit nervous, I said, yeah be careful, alot of the professors just need free programming years, and you are already 40 so what are you going to do with that PhD at 60?  (I guess I can do basic math in my sleep)  You were undeterred, so we went back to hacking.

you know, on the bright side, I shaved a few years off your current age.
but I dunno.... ready to go back for a 20-year PhD in graphics?

	-- Met young woman office working at school is at "desk" on elevator.
	I listen; I am very good at understanding her frustration w. her co-workers
	Conversation is interrupted by call, when she comes back she has a young guy  with her.  as she drives off I say, oh we should continue the conversation.
	She thinks I am hitting on her (I'm not) but she gives me her card which is oddly shapped.  when I look at it later it is for a free gift at some place, and was written intentionally to give to those hitting on her.  I am just a little sad at the situation, but not too much since I really was not.
	-- I lost my phone in another country.
	-- Was with mom and QL at home.  they said, ``... when we are out today...''
	and I asked anxiously, out for what?  to what the tennis finals.
	I said I didn't have time.  they were ok with it.  but then I started feeling bad that we never had time.
