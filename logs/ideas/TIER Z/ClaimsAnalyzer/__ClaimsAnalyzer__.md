LOST MONIES -- The bulk of an insurance companies expenses are tied to the servicing of claims. Thus reducing or eliminating avoidable losses are associated with claims processing is a central problem for such companies.  Specifically:
_
### --- PROBLEM ---

Reduce or elimiate avoidable losses associated with claims processing.  Specifically:

- The labor cost of claim processing
- Additional claims resulting from keeping claim open
- Losses paying for inappropriate treatment
- Losses from claims fraud



### --- SOLUTION ---

**NLP/AI/ML-Based Claims Processing**
Utilize artificial intelligence, machine learning, workflow automation to improve save financial costs associated with accident-related, medical-insurance claim processing through a combination a combination of (1) information summarization, (2) automated claim action analysis, and (3) claims-related workflow automation.


**SUMMARIZATION** -- Summarize large amounts of medical records, police reports, etc. into a form designed to efficient claims processing.  

**HIGHLIGHT** -- Highlight "triggering" aspects of claims material that require deeper consideration.

**EASY ACTIONS** -- Provide the confidence needed for fast action on "easy" cases: (1) Estimates showing quick payment will save money, (2) analyses showing claim is likely valid, or (3) analyses point directly at.

**ACTION ORIENTED ESTIMATION** -- Use cost estimates in order to determine best course of action.  Estimate expected costs of keeping case open verses losses if one cuts investigation short verses labor costs of the investigation itself.

**WORKFLOW** -- Organize summarization and analysis around steps of claim processing itself inorder structure and optomize claim process execution.

### --- SEGMENTS ---

**ACCIDENT RELATED MEDICAL CLAIMS** -- Sell a highly customized SaaS tool to a handful of large carriers and processors that process large numbers of accident related insurance claims


### --- UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION ---


SPECIALIZATION TOWARDS INTELLIGENT ACCIDENT CLAIMS PROCESSING
- Analytics designed around deep automated analysis of specific claim category.

ANALYSIS SPECIALIZED
Specialized (1) Statistical, (2) Textual, and (3) Semantic analysises automate initial understanding of and resoning required for claim processing   





## === PRODUCT DESCRIPTION ===


### --- Features List ---

- **WORKFLOW** -- Tool presents infomation to the adjuster as part of a standardized claims process flow.
	- **ACTION ORIENTED** -- Organization aims to optomize adjuster's time in drawing needed conclusions in order to fill in require information and make required action decisions.

- **PER COMPANY CUSTOMIZATION** -- Tool is integrated into claims data and claims processing tools used by each client company.  (what are the big platforms?)

- **RULE-CARD DRIVEN** -- Intelligent assistance is organized around "rule cards" that each perform a particular kind of analysis which will result is very targeted recommendations within subset of claims.  
	==> Optomized adjuster focus: all cards analyzed but only those relevant to current claim shown.

- **INTELLIGENT QUALIFICATION** -- ML is used to learn deeper/causal linkages, so rules are very targeted.



### --- A La Carte Ideas ---

- **CARD BASED INTELLIGENCE** -- Organanize ML, NLP, WORKFLOW, and PRESENTATION around set of very general "cards" that are only relevant some times, but when relevant provide very targeted action-oriented analysis.
	- MUCH DEEPER -- 
	- INTELLIGENT SEEMING -- User interface, automation actions, and visualzations and wording all geared towards analyzing and acting on very targeted kind of observation.
	- FOCUS EFFICIENT -- Is not distracting or even visible to user until it is very relevant.
		Intelligence only speaks when it has something impt to say, otherwise standard analysis is shown

- **LEARN CAUSAL CONNECTORS** -- Use ML+NLP to learn causal connectors within claims data.  e.g. this police report code results in risks of head trauma, assessment of this requires an MRI.

- **INDEX FRAUD & INAPPROPRIATE CHARGES BY CAUSAL CONNECTORS** -- Use connectors + ML + NLP to provide more refined analysis of claim charges.

- **LIKELY OUTCOMES** -- Use of many prior claims can be used to assess likely outcomes and provided quantitatively explicated course of action recommendation.  E.g.
	RECOMMEND EARLY PAYOUT.  Justification:
	- PAYOUT AMOUNT:			$pppp
	- TYPICAL PAYOUT:      	90% in $xxx-$yyy    3% >$zzz
	- REMAINING LABOR:		20 - 50 hrs
	- FRAUD POTENTIAL:		< .4%
	- ...

- **LIKELY OUTCOMES w INTELLIGENT QUALIFICATION** -- use intelligent qualificaiton to visibly improve outcomes predictions.

- **AUTO COMPOSITE DATA AGGREGATION**:  Use ML+NLP to auto identify specific kinds of info with full claims processing.  (e.g. statements of injury for matching&cross consideration, procedures performed)
	==> Organize full claim around these aggregated parts.

- **HISTORICAL QUALIFIERS** -- Look at full history of each claim for pattern of abuse or overuse.

- **PIECE BY PIECE ANALYSIS** -- Consider opportunities for saving on piece by piece basis.

- **HEADROOM BASED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT** -- Each intelligent card will require datascience, UX design, and software engineering to complete.  Product is developed by ordering potential cards by their "headroom" (the size of difference the card makes * the chances that the card will apply * the cost of creating the card)
