## === QUESTIONS ===

- size of the device
- amount of assistance
- counter weight
- use case at home in a prepared home
- hospital is hard
- about the independence

Gut reation to the core idea.    Ctx
- Idea of lifting from under stomach

Legalities
- In order to be able to just do testing w the elderly what approvals were needed.
- Safety precautions you guys used in practice
- any ideas about approvals needed to sell it
- how do you want to call this device?
	Class I.  no clinical trial.   risk/benefit analysis
	this device would probably be class I
	submitting to internal review board.
	Class II will go to FDA
- can hire IRB in order to gain approval 
- for your R&D it is up to you, 
- yoon worked with ENI -- in marin -- they were pretty leanient.  were ok.


How general good does this sound?
- needing for them to be able to sit up in bed.
- probably need them to hold on.
- 24/7 instant support for emergencies
- using this device w/o able bodied person around


Interest from investors, lab

Who else to ask about this
- Super entrepreneurial / strong Mech E folks
- probably your job would not allow you get funding/equity or own IP
- Non-profit / academic folks who would care to talk

cap-stone project.  senior or early master
Kazerooni -- approach him.  had ten projects.
>>-- going into the field.  take pictures, notes, ask just see situation
>>customer / user may be different

school of info at berkeley ... user interface development project classes
she brought exoskeleton to these classes

jacob design school berkeley -- more engineering focus
Alice Agalegno -- not exactly in rehab, she would care about this problem and very open & nice

### 2021 - 101 Mobility 

949-407-5310 -- Costa Mesa, CA 92627

Robotics Entreprenur

-- I have designs for an expensive "smart mover" which could move a person around a standard single story home.  
     On/Off the bed, the toilet, most chairs that are not pushed upto a table.
     Fridge, Microwave, Sink/Dishes
-- This device could be used by someone having reasonable mental capacity, and modest upper body mobility.  
   Could sit up in bed, could used hands to move their own legs around.
-- device would auto-connect to remote operators in the case of emergency, 
   thus is intended for use w/o any other person in the house.

### 2021.01.21 - Irving on wheelchair.com



Irving:

I am sure I will ask these questions to multiple people as I home in on good answers.  Really appreciate you taking the time to be the first.  I will just dive in knowing this will mostly be one person's opinion and not definitive answers:

Context:
-- I have designs for an expensive "smart mover" which could move a person around a standard single story home.  On/Off the bed, the toilet, most chairs that are not pushed upto a table.
-- One could open the fridge and access contents inside, could get high enough to operate a microwave on the back of a counter, or wash a dish in the sink, etc.
-- This device could be used by someone having reasonable mental capacity, and modest upper body mobility.  Could sit up in bed, could used hands to move their own legs around.
-- device would "phone home" to remote operators in the case of emergency, thus is intended for use w/o any other person in the house.

 
This is my rough understanding of the FDA approval situation, let me know if any claim seems way off base:
-- Such a super mover would need a class to approval from the FDA in order to be purchasable via insurance.
-- Such a super mover could be sold w/o FDA approval, but cost of insurance could be quite high... maybe it would be uninsurable.
-- Not clear if purchaser could purchase "as is" and take liability onto themselves.
-- Getting an FDA approval would be a multi-year (e.g. 3 year) process and require millions of dollars in effort

Such a device, if it could work, would be transformative since it would allow a certain class of person to avoid assisted care facility, and could allow them to operate alone in the home for most of the day, with regular visits supporting cleaning, bringing groceries etc.
-- If it could work this would be transformative?  yes/no
-- any idea what percentage of some defined market could be supported by such a device.  (you can frame the percentage of any group you know well enough to have an opinion)
    (in order to be useful, someone needs to be unable to move around on their own, but still strong enough to operate this device, AND want to have such a thing instead of having full time help)

Price
-- this thing is going to be EXPENSIVE.  Likely $30K to $50K per device.  It is far more expensive than existing technologies, but it also does something that existing technologies cannot do, it potentially allows folks to live alone who otherwise could not live alone.
-- If I did solve the "move around the house" problem, would that enable a class of people to live alone?
-- if so, is that obviously worth $30K or $50K?  Or not worth it.
-- Either way, what fraction of folks could afford such a thing?   (only a few?, many?)


It is a bunch of questions, sorry about that.  I am happy for any intuitions you have about any of them.

thanks!
--Dan

Irving,

Hello I am a newbie on the board, and indeed joined the board in order to learn a bit about the challenges and opportunities in building assistive devices.  I am a serial entrepreneur, but this particular idea is taking pretty far from home base.  (I have a PhD in AI).  I had some pretty basic questions about the road to FDA approval, and noticed that you had written once or twice about this topic.  Mind if I ask a few basic questions, both about FDA, but also generally about how to understand a community that I am pretty far from.

thanks in advance for any help,

### 2021.01.20 - ALS forum Query


Susan,

I am a former researcher and current entrepreneur who has been thinking about the problem of supporting autonomous in-home mobility for the frail.  I do not have ALS, but this does seem quite relevant for ALS.  I found an energetic post from you about ALS, that is why I wrote.

I hope to have a few conversations which could inform me about what would be possible and what would be valuable, but I am very unclear how to do this in the most respectful and cautious way.  A key problem to my approach is that it would be quite expensive.  I have no idea if it could be afforded.  Also I really only have a basic understanding of what ALS is really like, so I think I need to be careful to not offend by just asking stupid or callous questions.

My feeling is I should not be posting questions across whole forums, but rather identifying specific folks who might be in a position to help me, and would want to talk with me.  And then contact them directly.  

Since you mentioned being active in the community, I thought you could help point me to a specific person or two who would know the communities well?  

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide,
Dan

### 2020.10.08 - Out Reach to Yoon

Yoon,

Likely you cannot even recall how we connected.  It was at CES 2018 you were showing off the Berkeley Exoskeleton and I was the CTO for Aeolus robotics, we had a dexterous home robot on show at a booth very near yours.

I have been thinking about a new idea for locomotion for the elderly.  I am a bit out of my depth regarding the practicalities of robotics when they attach to a person, especially a frail person!  I recall you have both great interest and knowlege in this.

I am wondering if I can get your "gut reaction" to some early thinking in this direction?
A 15 minute call would be more than enough to get your reaction.

Let me know if you have time and interest for that call.

Best,
Dan
