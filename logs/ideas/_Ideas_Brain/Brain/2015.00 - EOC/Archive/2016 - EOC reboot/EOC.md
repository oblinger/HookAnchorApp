## computer revolution in trading

The system for trading futures stayed remarkably consistent. In the pit, traders shouted offers to buy and sell while keeping their eyes and ears open for other offers to jump on before making eye contact with the counterparty and then writing down the trade on a card.

“If you could have magically teleported a floor trader from the 1890s” to the 1990s, said Scott H. Irwin, a professor of agricultural marketing at the University of Illinois, “I suggest it would have taken them all of five minutes to get up to speed.”

But the technological change, when it came, happened quickly. The Merc introduced some electronic futures trading in the 1990s, and the board of trade opened its own system for electronically trading agricultural futures in 2006. As it became faster and often cheaper for institutions to trade online, orders to the pit began to dry up.

The monthly trading volume in soybean futures, for example, was less than 5 percent electronic in July 2006, according to exchange data collected by Mr. Irwin and Dwight R. Sanders, a professor of agribusiness economics at Southern Illinois University. Eighteen months later, the professors found, more than 80 percent of that trading volume was electronic.

These days, according to CME, open-outcry trading accounts for just 1 percent of the total trading volume in futures.
