SUFFICIENT COMPONENTS

A Physical Embodiment – most of the systems learning is not supervised explicitly by an instructor, it is this embodiment that provides needed input

Touch & See itself – seeing its arms through the lenses of its own eyes provides a feedback loop that swallows the world.

Peers & Mentors – it must have peers and mentors.  Among the infinite variations possible it is their behavior that contains the essence of effective action.  Its peers & mentors must have an analogous embodiment, anything else makes the task of mapping what is seen onto effective behavior for itself that much more difficult.

Feedback – hot/cold, hungry, sated, hurting.  They provide a built in drive toward understanding and control of its world. 

Unsupervised abstraction – most of humanities knowledge is latent in humanity itself, its books, its actions, its language.  The cost of looking is cheap, the cost of asking is high.

Closed Control Loop – dddddd

Crude Emotions – Humans and dogs share many key emotions like anger, fear, curiosity, and frustration.  The wide differences in these emotions is due in part to wide difference in cognitive reasoning abilities between the two.  In the same way, precursors for conscious machines must also have emotions, though until shaped by a rich cognitive context these emotions are mere shadows of their human counterparts.  Shadows they may be, but they are enough to get the ball rolling.



CRUDE EMOTIONS

Fear – Predicting future negative reward.

Curiosity – Attending to that with makes some but not complete sense.

Aha – Unexpected relationships are the crucial bread crumbs leading between basins of understanding.

Frustration – Frustration is both the cap that limits unproductive behaviors, and is the gate providing access to actions normally excluded for safety or other consideration.

Desire – The root of all goals 

Desire to control – This basic human drive serves silicon in similar stead; it provides that basis for learning to control with little understanding how that control might be later used.  Desiring to have all ones world under ones control drives one to understand what is possible in that world.

Desire to survive – while not strictly needed for a single consciousness, it ensures that in a society of such, it is not eliminated.  Interestingly this emotion often emerges, in multiple ways, from other emotions.
