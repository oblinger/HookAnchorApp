MAPS -- 

-  Inherently interdisciplinary -- show how it relates to other fields
   show which best practices are taken from each discipline so TT builds immediately 
   from the best that humanity has to offer for each of its components.

-  component map -- what are the parts of TT ecosystem; how do they group.

-  functional map -- what is the functional purpose of each part, what does the accept & produce

-  prototypical IT architecture of components

-  players map -- whe are the interested classes of people and what are their roles

-  motivational map -- who are the classes

Vik, 
I think you owe me a white paper framework.  I think i am supposed to give you shit for not sending it.
so here is some      >>>> SHIT <<<<


by the way, i was thinking a bit about how one might frame the entire space.
here was some quick thoughts, feel free to use or ignore.


=== TECHNO-THERAPY ===

I imagine it begin defined as ...

Then noted that techno-therapy is inherently interdisciplinary.  it is a field that draws expertise and practice from
a collection of relevant fields:

EXPERIMENTAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE --

PSYCHOLOGY -- 

COMPUTER SCIENCE --



======= TECHNO-THERAPY FRAMEWORK ======

[[Then in my imaginiation the way I might explain Techno Therapy as a framework for academic 
  endevor and for human action, I might express TT as a series of 'maps' that show how
  all the parts fit together.  It seems to me that one of the interesting things about the TT 
  eco-system is how much of a 'system' it is.  It really requires a pretty complex web of 
  different players, with different abilities and needs coming together in a complex way.
  Further the activity itself builds from compentancies and abilities drawn from very disparate
  parent fields.  So in my imagination, your job it is to explain how all those parts come together,
  and how to make all those parts work effectively together.

  it seems this is not one explaination, but multiple.  a tech explanation, a motivational explanaiton
  a data flow explanaiton, an experimental setup / physchological explaitnion, a funding explanation.

  really each part is kinda straightforward, but the whole thing is NOT straightforward.
  and in my imagination you contribution is to lay that whole thing out, and explain the 
  requirements and considertaions simultaneiously from ALL of those perspectives.]]
