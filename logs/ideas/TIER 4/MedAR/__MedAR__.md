##### - Ask Angie -
Its "Ask Angie" program, for example, provides remote help to customers that are having trouble setting up or operating Boston Scientific's products. The system uses augmented reality from vendor Help Lightning to superimpose an expert's hands over a customer's real-world camera view to help guide the setup of new devices.



##### - B. Sci prepares for virtual appointments -
How top medical device manufacturer Boston Scientific is preparing for the telemedicine wave that its digital health chief estimates could turn 80% of all physician appointments virtual




80%. 

That's the eye-popping portion of the nearly 884 million in-person physician visits each year that Boston Scientific Chief Digital Health Officer David Feygin thinks could be handled entirely remotely. 

A few years ago, industry insiders may have balked at that number. But now, as the coronavirus pandemic discourages people from close human-to-human contact, it is suddenly a very realistic estimate. 

Telehealth has soared in popularity during the outbreak. And as positive cases grow and officials estimate the worst is still ahead, healthcare companies are quickly pivoting to support the rapid adoption. 

At Boston Scientific, the Massachusetts-based medical device manufacturer that reported nearly $11 billion in revenue in 2019, that means a focus on creating virtual solutions for mentoring or service support, and even remotely overseeing the insertion of devices like pacemakers and catheters.  

"We need to build tele-everything capabilities for what is going to be a tele-first healthcare reality," Feygin told Business Insider. "Before, digital was a nice-to-have. It improved outcomes and drove some efficiency. But now it's absolutely critical to safety, to patients actually receiving care, and to our own business continuity." 

Now, Boston Scientific is putting into practice certain nascent solutions that it was piloting, but never thought would play such a prominent role in its daily operations. 

Its "Ask Angie" program, for example, provides remote help to customers that are having trouble setting up or operating Boston Scientific's products. The system uses augmented reality from vendor Help Lightning to superimpose an expert's hands over a customer's real-world camera view to help guide the setup of new devices.


While the virtual hand can't grab anything, it can point or draw on the screen to aid users. Adoption of the program increased slowly over the past few years, but usage nearly quadrupled in April amid the outbreak. 

Feygin likened the overall pivot to the ongoing push across corporate America to be cloud-first — or a move away from physical centers as the primary data storage venue. 

"The floodgates are really open," he said. "The patients like it, the physicians love it, the insurers understand that it actually saves them money, and the regulatory barriers have really come down." 

Utilizing a 'center of excellence' 
Feygin credits the ability to adapt nearly overnight to meet the surge in telemedicine to a multi-year transformation in its IT department. 

Like other firms, the company pivoted to an agile-like team structure — one that utilizes small, cross-functional teams tasked with a specific goal to quickly produce minimum viable products that could then be constantly improved.

It's a major shift from management styles that kept employees largely siloed within their own departments and delayed the release of new products or features until they were fully tested. 

"All of the work that we've put in...is now just more relevant than ever," said Feygin. "We are doing the exact same work we have been doing, just doing it 10-times faster." 

The company employs what some refer to as the "hub-and-spoke" model, where a central organization — often dubbed the "Center of Excellence" — is tasked with overseeing various innovation hubs.

It's a common approach that organizations use when trying to roll-out new digital tools, as it allows for advocates of the technology to work directly within various business units with a goal of spurring more wide adoption. Other companies, like Amazon, take a top-down approach to implementing emerging tech. 

Now, the agile method is being more widely-used across the company, according to Feygin. 

"The organization has become much more laser focused on a handful of things that are going to help us get back to business, and obviously help us help our customers get back to business," he said.
