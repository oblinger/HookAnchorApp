## Grabber Support

Actions that support grabbers can capture context from the current application when invoked with the grab modifier (typically 'g'). The grabbed context is used to create commands that can recreate the current state.

Currently, the `template` action type has full grabber support, allowing it to capture application context and create commands based on grabber rules defined in the configuration.

## Command Usage

Most action types can be used as command actions, meaning they can be assigned to commands in the commands.txt file or created dynamically. Actions marked as "Can Use as Command: No" are typically system actions that control the HookAnchor interface itself.

## Configuration Example

```yaml
actions:
  # Template action bound to Cmd+D
  doc_page:
    action_type: template
    key: "Cmd+D"
    description: "Create documentation page"
    name: "Doc{{input}}"
    action: "doc"
    arg: "/Users/oblinger/ob/kmr/T/DOC/Doc{{input}}.md"
    
  # Simple URL opener
  github:
    action_type: open_url
    key: "Cmd+G"
    url: "https://github.com"
    
  # TMUX session creator
  new_session:
    action_type: tmux_create
    key: "Cmd+T"
    folder: "{{current_folder}}"
    command: "claude --continue"
```
