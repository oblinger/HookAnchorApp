## Core Idea

PROPOSITION
- There are a few dozen investment pundants that each have a following willing to spend money
- They each propose specific quantitative kinds of thinking (specfic measures to look at)




VALUES
- help automate investor thinking
- SENSE -- build triggers based on 
  - set of metrics for broad class of specific assets
  - "hand collected" data
  - speciality measures for that pundit
- SOCIAL GROUP -- share effort & reward for analysis
  


TOOL ABILITIES
- Screen (select by criteria)
- Sort (order options by goodness score)
- Alert (when condition is met)
- Calculate (any formula w. parameters e.g. like time frame window size, etc.)
- ACTIONS:  buy/sell/shift group A/B



SOCIAL MECHANISM
(1) Facebook user is given a peek within some relevant investment circles.
(2) Users fill out profile, and then do some analysis, collecting, selection
(3) When multiple users analyze a common underlying 'thing'   
    (specific stock like apple, or investor like buffett)
    then other users rate these analyses relative to each other
(4) Your community score is a measure of how good your stuff is relative to others, and
    how central your area(s) are relative to others.
(5) The higher your community score, the more circles you can monitor, for doing your investing,
    and/or the sooner you see posts of others.   (E.g. if you have a very high community score, then
    you get to see (and maybe act upon) the ideas of other people 12 hours earlier than most.
