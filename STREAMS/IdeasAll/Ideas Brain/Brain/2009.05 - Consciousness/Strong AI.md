Personal Take on Strong AI:

With all the caution in the text above, one might conclude that I believe we were very far from Strong AI.
Based on the comments I hear across the AI field, and from other program managers, I see that I am in the minority 
in beliving that strong AI is not far away.  But I believe it will occur as an end run around almost all of the current research in AI.
An example illustrates this point:

If you look at current part-of-speech taggers, they all bootstrap statistical models from massive amounts of text.
Their academic lineage is not from linguistic world at all.  In the 80s many many linguists busyied themselves with understanding the
bysantine rules of languge in order build expert systems for tagging.  Within the span of 1 or 2 years this whole sub-discipline was
wiped off the map, by stupid statistical bootstrapping algorithms that only implicitly understood the knowlege these poor academics 
piece together year after year.  and that stupid algorithm kicked their butts.  Today, parsers are increasingly built not, by understanding 
language, but rather by filling in a basic framework with thousands of language details bootstrapped from massive text.


Note: I am not implying that simple statistical algorithms of today are sufficient.  But I am claiming that there exists a simple
algorithm that bootstraps strong AI, and when we have that algorithm, it will by pass much of the painstaking "system building"
work of the 80s, 90s, 00s, since it will, in-one-fell-swoop, bootstrap all of that knowledge directly from the world, just as parsers
and part of speech taggers by pass work before it, but directly inducing rules from massive text.

A second claim:  We don't actually know how close the algorithms of today are to Strong AI, (I accept this is a minority (but growing)
position in AI).  Many argue that we are far from strong AI, on the basis of the pathetic performance of AI systems when compared to humans.
My counter to the sentiment, is to note that the computation power we currently provide AI systems is less than 1/1,000,000 human brain power.
I expect the human intelligence algorithms would perform poorly if given only 1 millionth the resources.  Another sentiment 



So I do see a single DARPA program that could be the basis of strong AI.  It looks very different than the boxes in our pyrimid.  
It looks closer to Josh's deep learning, but add
