Core Argument

SETUP OF THE EMA
•	A generic modeling system will model all complex systems that it can sense.
•	Assume it can sense many aspects of a computational agent embedded in some physical world executing an ‘instinctual’ behavior algorithm.  (e.g. avoid pain, eat food, mate, etc.)
•	In such a setting the modeling system would build abstractions of both the world and the agent.  These would include a 
o	Model the world
o	Model the physical (external) interaction of the agent with the world.
(e.g. if agent’s eyes are blocked, visual perception of an object will fail even though the object is there according to the world model.  Or after running far, agent moves more slowly, and pain-signals are sensed.)
o	Model the internal sensing system of the agent itself  (e.g. )
o	Model the states of the instinctual behavior algorithm.  (e.g. agent saw tiger print, thought of a powerful aggressive tiger, agent ran away.   The modeling system would has a simple model of why special agent, and other agents to this.)
•	If the instinctual behavioral system is adaptive, and it is exposed to the models produced by the modeling system, then the following increasingly more complex behaviors arise:
o	Initially agent executes instinctive responses to pain, or food sense signals.
o	If conceptual abstractions correlate highly with instinctive sense states then the adaptive system will adapt to rely on those abstractions as well as instinctive states.  (e.g. 
	Being bit by a snake will cause the avoid response (fight/flight)
	Later seeing a snake (now associated with pain) will cause same.  
	Later instinctual system triggers avoid response before agent is about to put hand into log (where snakes are sometimes found)
o	Importantly, we assume the instinctual system is driven by an attentional mechanism (it can be a fixed heuristic) for attending to some aspects and not others at each moment in time.

BELIEFS ABOUT THE PHYSICAL AGENT
Take all of this to its logical conclusion, these are the beliefs are generated about the embodied modeling agent (EMA) itself:
Physical Agent – In general, all agents of a given class share a common set of physical characteristics, abilities, behaviors, etc.  But one agent, though sharing all those properties, is special because:
•	All perception is from the perspective of that agent.
•	Mental states affect the behavior of that agent, whereas in general mental states have no effect on the world, nor on the actions of any agent except that special agent.
•	Predictions can be made about the special agent’s actions, and also about the effects of those actions that cannot be made about other agents.  (e.g. predicting that the special agent will attack before it has done so.  Or predicting that the special agent is about to slip and fall, before it has slipped and fell.)

BELIEFS ABOUT THE AGENT’S MIND
Mental Agent – The EMA’s model of the world includes agents with beliefs and behaviors based on those beliefs.  The EMA’s model of the special agent is no different in this respect except:
Special agent’s mental model is much richer.
	There is a much, much richer model of the special agent’s mental model.  (e.g. There may be a model of jack as angry at jill because jill took jack’s food.  But model’s of the special agent’s model of the world more much more complex, including a model of jill as the kind of agent that typically never engages in such behavior.  By comparison the model of the jack and jill’s mental-state has no such depth.)
	Said another way, the set of things that can be articulated (are believed) about the mental state of special agent is much larger and richer than any other agent.
Direct access to the cause of special agent’s mental behavior
	There are sense-perceptions that do not correspond to any state in the physical world, nor the mental world, nor even the richer mental world that can be articulated about the special agent.  
	These additional sense perceptions can in some cases reliably predict future mental states of the special agent, and only the special agent.  
	When building a full causal model of all known components there will be a mental component for each physical agent in the world.  For the special agent that will be an expanded model, and further it will include an implied extra node.  This node is causally prior to the special agent’s mental model which is causally prior to it physical behavior.

BELIEFS ABOUT THE INNER AGENT’S MIND
The Extra Causal Node – (The agent within the agent)
•	It must be there, because there are perception, X, which are correlated but not entirely prediction by perceptions & mental states of the special agent, and when perception X occurs, it in turn, is correlated but doesn’t entirely predict future mental states of the special agent.
•	The attentional mechanism of the EMA in particular is clearly part of this unknown causal intermediary, it is related to what is seen, and it affects beliefs and actions of the special agent.  
•	These components are irreducible; from the EMA’s perspective the workings of all of these components are atomic and automatic, so further introspection is possible.
•	A natural conclusion is these perceptions result from some yet unknown “extra” causal component, a component that can see what the special agent sees, and is the cause of the mental behavior of the special agent.
•	The extra component fits the general description of an agent like those it sees in the external world, but this agent apparently has no access except through the senses and thoughts of the special agent, and apparently has not action except to affect the special agent.
•	Further there is direct access to at least coorelates of this extra agents processing, things are known that can only be known by the mind of this extra agent.  
•	Some of the accessible beliefs are the beliefs of that inner agents mind, they originate in that mind, without evidence of a communication channel, the container of those beliefs must be the extra agent’s mind.
•	In particular the EMA will conclude: 
o	“this thought right now, is what the extra agent is thinking right now”  and 
o	“the container of this thought is the mind of the extra agent”
o	“all accessible beliefs are in the mind of the special agent, and that the mind is broken into introspectable and irreducible components.

•	Abstracting 

•	Language – Relate communicated info to internal (non-lingual) concepts
•	Qualia –  Distinction arises between experience (which has always existed) and communicated information which can not be mapped onto sublingual concepts but which is easily distinguished as quite different in character by the system.
•	Building predictive world models
•	World models that include itself
•	Predictive self models
•	Meta reasoning 
•	Linking aspects of the experiential self with the modeled self.
•	Optomizing aspects of the experiential self based on predictive modeling at the meta level directly.   (rewriting raw emotional drivers)
•	Indirect manipulation of emotional self based on meta-analysis given existing fixed goals.
•	Second order meta analysis of the system looking at itself.
•	Recognizing the inductively generated super analyses possible, and exploring the fixed point of the ‘Analysis – of’ function.  That is the system considers what goals one would ultimately fix upon if one continued to repeat the analyzing of ones analyzing ones goals.  
o	This is like reading self help books
•	Search the space of other fixed points for this system – that is consider what other control loops one could have that are their own end points.

 
THE EMBODIED MODELING ENGINE (EME)


THE PARTS OF THE EMBODIED MODELLING ENGINE (EME)

The EME has:
1.	A computational substrate, C, that at each time step accepts a vector of inputs, I, updates its internal state, S, and outputs some vector of output values, O.  
2.	Ability to sense some world, W.      Ii = <…+Fsense(Wi)+… >
3.	Ability to act in that world, to control some embodiment in W.   
      Ei = Fact(Oi)  Ei in Wi
4.	Ability to sense its own actions in that world.   Ii+1  Ii’+1  if   Oi   Oi’
5.	Ability to sense the internal state of the agent’s computational substrate.

6.	A behavioral “brain” model, B, is the function executed on the computational substrate, C, determine the behavior of the EME.  Formally B maps a brain state and brain input to a new brain state and a brain output. <Si+1,Oi> = B(Si, Ii)
7.	The behavioral model is  broken into several key modules listed here:
a.	Instinct – 
b.	Modeling Engine –  
8.	Instinctual nature – some algorithm, A, that drives the agent’s actions based on it perceptions in some systematic way.     C is executing A such that Oi = A(Ii)
9.	An animal nature –
10.	An internal world model.  The state the animal nature algorithm includes an internal world model, M.  Mi include:
a.	Ji justified state atoms   XXXXXXXXX
b.	confidence
c.	Direct abstractions (no justifications)
d.	Fabstract(Ii)
e.	Ji justification connectives
f.	Di fuctional dependancies
11.	Reflexive abstractions.  Set of abstractions, ABSi = Fabstract(Ii, Si) that are continuously computed as part of the animal nature.
12.	Model acquisition module.  Part of the animal nature includes at least one mechanism for acquiring (by induction, by communication, by abduction, by deduction …) functional models that exist between observed variables.  
13.	Directed adaptation. Significant aspects of A (and subsequent embodies behavior) is a function of adaptable modules driven be some optimization criteria in B.
14.	Existence of other embodied agents in world
15.	Ability to communicate with other agents
16.	Common language that maps among other things assertions about the state of the world.

23.	Modeling of the larger social context
24.	Modeling of the causal context for its creation
25.	Systems takes end run around a missing choice point—that is, is models its animal nature and modulates its inputs in a way that this animal nature reacts to achieve an ultimate objective
26.	Self deception.  System modeles is modeling of the world and intentionally causes its base abstraction to mis represent the world in a way that its animal nature performs some desired action.  (e.g. not looking down while up high) 
27.	Deception of others.


Humans use communication to provide ‘root’ goal system.

 
Consciousness Conjecture


The Oblinger Consciousness Thesis – four claims regarding the relationship between the EME and consciousness.

1.	The EME explains the subjective experiences of consciousness including:  awareness, qualia, experience of knowledge, experience of non-communicatable 
2.	All subjective and objective aspects of human consciousness are consistent with the conjecture that human consciousness is implemented within the EME framework.
3.	A human engineered implementation of EME will exhibit behaviors of a conscious agent.
4.	A human engineered implementatation of EME will report the subjective experiences of consciousness.
