1. **DERIVE POPULATION FACTORS, CLUSTERS**
	- Use existing surveys to derive an order list of 'factors' that best describe survey data.
	- Cluster US population according to these factors
2. **SURVEY & RECRUIT PARTICIPANTS**
	- Survey existing participants to determine which cluster they belong in
	- Measure under-representation both at the factor (axis) level, and at the cluster level.
	- Recruit new participant for under-represented areas.
		- Perform recruiting from within specific sub-populations (e.g. specialized reddit forum)
		- Use existing participants of a given type to recruit more like minded participants
	- Monitor voting behavior of participants to see they are not far out of line w/ their cluster
