Welcome to the SV Team! We reserved a room for you for the company trip in March so I just wanted to give you all the details. We will be staying at 474 Buenos Aires Hotel in Argentina from March 13th-16th and have all-day meetings on the 14th and 15th. For both meeting days, we will have catered breakfast and lunch. For flights, we have had everyone book their own flight with a checked bag included and send the receipt to [accounting@sportsvisio.com](mailto:accounting@sportsvisio.com) to be reimbursed.
