# Social ToTry

http://swissnexsanfrancisco.org//
If you don't already know, a group that sometimes hosts interesting events is 
the Churchill Club.  It's hit or miss, but if you're aggressive and choose the events
carefully, you can meet some interesting people.

Another place that sometimes hosts interesting events (for free) is called Swissnex.  
The plus is that the event is free, but sometimes this attracts people who just want the free
food (which is a nice spread) or people who are job hunting.  


# Tourist

For the Argentinians, my favorite places for tourists are:

- [Muir Woods National Monument](https://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm): Amazing redwoods to walk through, don't exist anywhere else in the world

- [Battery Spencer Overlook](https://www.nps.gov/places/000/battery-spencer-overlook.htm): Decommissioned WWII military installation, feels like you can touch the Golden Gate Bridge

- [Tunnel Tops](https://presidio.gov/explore/attractions/presidio-tunnel-tops): Really chill place to hang and check out the view

- [Golden Gate Bridge](https://www.goldengate.org/bridge/visiting-the-bridge/): Really cool to walk across this

  

Given that this is their first time to the city and are on a short trip, I'd hit the SF highlights.
