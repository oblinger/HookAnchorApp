Megan,

Your place is *so* gorgeous!  I am stunned and a little perplexed that you are renting both bedrooms for $1100.
I can only assume that you are wanting to ensure a very responsible renter.  

Let me address that part of me first:

My salary is above $150K/yr so timely paying of rent will not be an issue.
I am happy to put down whatever is needed as well.

I am 46 years old and the CTO for a starup company, so "bringing the party home" is not part of the life I lead.

I have recently moved from DC, and NYC before that.  In both places I have beautiful aparments that I loved.
I love having a beautiful space that is both sparsely decorated, and immaculately clean.  It just makes me feel
great to come home such a restful open tranquil space, so I take the time on a daily basis to keep my place scrubbed.

I am trying to think of the best ways to convey the level of care that I bring.
Perhaps the best is to show you photos of my previous apartments.  I also had a roomate in NYC, and she
could tell you about me too.


Please let me know what more you would like to know about me, and also let me know why your place is being rented for $1100, it seems so special for that price.


Thanks, 
Dan
