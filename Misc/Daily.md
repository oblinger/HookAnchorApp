## Now

### 2024-05-01  Reflection on 2023
- I grew to really do things and engage strongly with Eli
- I grew dramatically at Sports Visio into the CTO role.
  I am now a pretty damn strong CTO.
- Biggest learning from failure is to learn that I need to move fast.
	- Strong in the moment planning and org needed.
	- Focus on delegation and empowerment of others
	- Focus on fewer activities

- A year of transition from stasis toward action.  (but mostly still in stasis)
- Family grew a bit in doing things together
- Health was not a focus

WHAT WOULD BE 10X BETTER IN 2024?
- Healthy - Totally kicking it health wise.  VO2max jumping up
	- 40-min 4x week in health
- Spiritually strong - Iron discipline about thinking @ night
- Lock & loaded on dan-next:
	- Geared for gen-AI
- Back to great intimacy
	- ??? - Bi-monthly dating & family nights
- Energized by daily activity
	- Twice weekly FUN ACTIVITIES

### 2024-04-03  marriage

Our marriage is in trouble.  I feel resistance to even trying to interact.


### 2024-04-02  Equanimity

My days are spent constantly tripping from one thing to the next, never feeling caught up, never feeling enough, rarely feeling effective.  Always with confidence that I could do so much more with my talents than I am.

**Actually this could stop today.**  From a certain perspective I AM as caught up as I ever will be.  I will always have many more things I want to get done than I have time to do them.  Of course at a tactical level I could get more caught up on pressing things of the moment, and I want to do this.  And I could get more effective with my hours, so that I can get more things done in a week.  And I want to do that too.  Still even if I succeed in doing this I will essentially be where I already am right now: done with many things, yet still many more things still un-done. 

**Thus I resolve.**  Today I am caught up, it is enough, and I have equanimity right now.  Then within this space of equanimity I will progressively move to clear my plate of the great back log of immediate actions either my doing them, or my relegating them to a "someday" list which mostly means "never" to be done.  And very slowly I will advance my ability to work effectively on important activities so that I am a bit more effective than I am today.

**Most Importantly.**  These activities must result in a sense of completion, and actual space for non-work activities.... time with family.  spirituality.  projects and fun.  Not many hours of each, there are not the hours required to do as much as I imagine.  still there will be enough.
