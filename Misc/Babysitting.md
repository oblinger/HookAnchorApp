We have need weekly or every other week for some Toddler TLC.  Usually Saturday mornings, but sometimes at other times too, if you can make it.  We are all setup for you guys to play at home, and there are several parks, library, etc. in short walking distance too.  Our son Eli is good natured and gentle.  We are looking for someone that genuinely like playing with little ones, that way the time can be more fulfilling for both of you!
