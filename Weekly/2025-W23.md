I am on equally thin ice as my training is in mathematics, not philosophy, and I agree that the medium is awesome for the conversations it generates.

Indeed, sqrt(2) is constructable just as you say, my point was an epistemological one.

The unit square does not exist in a physical sense; there could never be four lines that are infinitely thin and precisely one unit in length, etc. Still, in a Platonic sense, the unit square exists in the universe of mathematical objects.  

So does a line segment.  In the same universe, I think.  But for me, it would be odd if the collection of line segments that existed in that universe were to be adjusted each time we imagined a new construction technique.  It feels more natural that all possible lengths of line segment all exist, but some are constructable via a set of techniques, while others are unreachable.

You seem to want to say, no, if we have not yet thought of such a construction path, then they don't exist yet, and later they do.

I should acknowledge that I think I am a Platonist deep in my soul.  That is, it seems that all of mathematics is out there, and we are merely using our minds to shine a light down one corridor in an infinite maze, while on another day, we look elsewhere.  But in no case did we "create" what we say; we merely chose where to look.

I have tried to imagine the alternate view, that we are creating as we look.  Inventing the things we find from whole cloth.  But I cannot make that view 'stick' in my head---it seems wrong.
