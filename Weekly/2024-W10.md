I am a long time Mint user, and I use them to track all accounts.

The Credit Karma TOS says you can check my credit on a weekly basis...   this would harm my score, so I have no interest in Credit Karma checking my accounts.

How do I opt out of this?  I you looked annually and sent me the report, that would be acceptable, but regular pinging of my credit is not ok.

What can we do about this?

Thanks,
Dan
