I purchased an "Airline Approved" pet carrier at the airport when requested by Delta, and have used it on many flights since then.

It is the Worldwise "Serpa", it is a small bit larger than what you post on your website (its size is at 19"x11.75"x11.5")

I just purchased a ticket, but if I cannot be sure I will be able to travel with my dog then I will need to cancel this ticket. As I say, I have travelled on many airlines with this bag.  What should I do?





I am a long time Mint user, and I use them to track all accounts.

The Credit Karma TOS says you can check my credit on a weekly basis...   this would harm my score, so I have no interest in Credit Karma checking my accounts.

How do I opt out of this?  I you looked annually and sent me the report, that would be acceptable, but regular pinging of my credit is not ok.

What can we do about this?

Thanks,
Dan
