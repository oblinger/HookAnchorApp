 Indeed I think “overshoots” on both sides tend to cause the country to oscillate each round giving the other side room to win the votes needed to take back power.

  

More important, the natural end point of that kind of warfare is the complete destruction of our government.  The balance of powers cannot rest on rules alone without some norms.  

  

So I AM ready to fight dirty with the Reps, but not at the expense of the country.

(Even if they started it, and if they do it.

If set status is performed serially on our server machine it seems that would keep our CPU from spiking and would keep all other actions responsive.  right?  Of course we also would need to scale instances if we started getting a backlog in this queue (which we would get eventually).  This just seems a quicker hack than a full refactor of the code, but I don't mean to suggest it as a replacement for refactoring.
