  Summary of the problem:
  - Spotlight server is disabled at a system level
  - Bootstrap commands fail with I/O error
  - This appears to be a known bug, especially on Sequoia

  Options to try:

  1. Boot into Safe Mode (hold Shift during restart on Intel, or hold power button then click "Continue in Safe Mode" on Apple Silicon):
    - Safe Mode often fixes Spotlight issues automatically
    - After booting, restart normally and check if Spotlight works
  2. Run Disk First Aid:
    - System Settings → General → Storage → Disk Utility (or Cmd+Space type "Disk Utility")
    - Select your main drive and run First Aid
  3. If you're running OCLP (OpenCore Legacy Patcher) on an unsupported Mac, this is a known issue that requires a login script workaround
  4. Last resort — Reinstall macOS (non-destructive):
    - Boot into Recovery (hold Cmd+R or power button)
    - Reinstall macOS over your existing installation
    - This preserves your files but fixes system components

  Would you like to try Safe Mode? That's the most likely fix without reinstalling.
