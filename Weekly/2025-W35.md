YOU WROTE:  You talk about Palestinian "motivating desire" to kill Israelis but refuse to acknowledge why that desire exists.

I have acknowledged it, you refuse to acknowledge my acknowledgement!

YOU WROTE:  Palestinians hate Israel as an extremely direct and completely understandable result of what Israelis have done to them. The end. 

I hereby acknowledge the extremely understandable desire to blow some shit up if generation after generation lived in the conditions in Gaza.
Fully acknowledged, but it's not "the end."  Now we need to solve the problem!

You presume, based on my choice of Claim #1, that I want to pin blame on Gaza and place pressure there first.  That is not an accurate assumption.  Let me begin by agreeing to your claim #0 from Carter at the end:














  1. ~/.claude.json = Your conversation/project history (4.6MB data file)
  2. ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json = The actual MCP server configuration

I stopped responding because your framing is ridiculous and you seem so
dug in on it there's no point in arguing with it. Even here, all you've done is
changed one completely arbitrary number for another.
1000 with motivating desire to kill Israeli citizens? Okay, how about 999? Or
500? How do we find out whether these people exist? Do we include the
question, "Do you have motivating desire to kill thousands of Israeli citizens" on a
poll?
Most importantly, and this is the key point for me, are you seriously naive
enough to imagine that if the Palestinians meet this 1000-person threshold,
the Israelis will suddenly start acting in good faith and acknowledge/end the
litany of crimes (the occupation, the settlers, the apartheid) that they've been
committing for decades?

You talk about Palestinian "motivating desire" to kill Israelis but refuse to
acknowledge why that desire exists.
Palestinians hate Israel as an extremely direct and completely
understandable result of what Israelis have done to them. The end. So to
frame the solution to this as doing nothing until the Palestinians forgive
these decades of oppression, all without demanding that the Israelis do
anything to make amends, is preposterous.
Israel will be safe from attacks when it makes a genuine attempt at peace
that recognises the humanity and rights of the Palestinians. Funnily enough,
I recently saw an interview with Jimmy Carter saying almost exactly the
same thing eighteen years ago. I wish, for all concerned, that Israel had
listened to him then.
