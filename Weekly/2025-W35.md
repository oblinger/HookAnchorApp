YOU WROTE:  You talk about Palestinian "motivating desire" to kill Israelis but refuse to acknowledge why that desire exists.

I have acknowledged it, you refuse to acknowledge my acknowledgement!

YOU WROTE:  Palestinians hate Israel as an extremely direct and completely understandable result of what Israelis have done to them. The end. 

I acknowledge the extremely understandable desire to "blow some shit up" if I lived with an Israeli boot upon my neck, as Gaza does generation after generation.  I hereby fully acknowledge this, but it's not "the end."  Now we need to solve the problem!  Not in some fantasy moral world, but in this actual, real world with real humans behaving as expected.

You presume, based on my choice of (mortal danger) Claim #1, that I want to pin blame on Gaza and place pressure there first.  That is not an accurate assumption.  Let me begin by agreeing to your claim #0 from Carter:

Claim #0: Israel will be safe from attacks when it makes a genuine attempt at peace that recognizes the humanity and rights of the Palestinians. 

There are nuances, but I generally buy Claim #0 too, and even put it first:

Claim 0 allows the possibility of safety in Claim 1 

Claim #1: Israel will not grant freedom to Palestinians while it feels a mortal threat from them.

This allows the possibility of granting freedom.

Note: In each step, I say "allows possibility," I don't mean to say it will happen easily or without pressure. Instead, I am making the more limited claim that without achieving claim 0 or claim 1, there is no point to direct pressure for freedom.

I stopped responding because your framing is ridiculous and you seem so
dug in on it there's no point in arguing with it. Even here, all you've done is
changed one completely arbitrary number for another.
1000 with motivating desire to kill Israeli citizens? Okay, how about 999? Or
500? How do we find out whether these people exist? Do we include the
question, "Do you have motivating desire to kill thousands of Israeli citizens" on a
poll?
Most importantly, and this is the key point for me, are you seriously naive
enough to imagine that if the Palestinians meet this 1000-person threshold,
the Israelis will suddenly start acting in good faith and acknowledge/end the
litany of crimes (the occupation, the settlers, the apartheid) that they've been
committing for decades?

You talk about Palestinian "motivating desire" to kill Israelis but refuse to
acknowledge why that desire exists.
Palestinians hate Israel as an extremely direct and completely
understandable result of what Israelis have done to them. The end. So to
frame the solution to this as doing nothing until the Palestinians forgive
these decades of oppression, all without demanding that the Israelis do
anything to make amends, is preposterous.
Israel will be safe from attacks when it makes a genuine attempt at peace
that recognises the humanity and rights of the Palestinians. Funnily enough,
I recently saw an interview with Jimmy Carter saying almost exactly the
same thing eighteen years ago. I wish, for all concerned, that Israel had
listened to him then.
