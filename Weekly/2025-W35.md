YOU WROTE:  You talk about Palestinian "motivating desire" to kill Israelis but refuse to acknowledge why that desire exists.

Steve, you have an idea in your head about my position rather than listening to what I am saying.  I have acknowledged it, let me do so again:

YOU WROTE:  Palestinians hate Israel as an extremely direct and completely understandable result of what Israelis have done to them. The end. 

I acknowledge the extremely understandable desire to "blow some shit up" if a person lived with an Israeli boot upon their neck, just as Gaza does generation after generation.  I hereby fully acknowledge this.  

But it's not "the end."  Now we need to solve the problem!  Not in some fantasy moral world, but in this actual, real world with real populations behaving as expected.

You presume, based on my choice of the (mortal danger) Claim #1, that I want to pin blame on Gaza and place pressure there first.  That is not true.  Let me begin by agreeing to your claim #0 from Carter:

Claim #0: Israel will be safe from attacks when it makes a genuine attempt at peace that recognizes the humanity and rights of the Palestinians. 

There are nuances, but I generally buy Claim #0 as well and even put it first:

Claim 0 allows the possibility of satisfying claim 1.

Claim #1: Israel will not grant freedom to Palestinians while it feels a mortal threat from them.

This allows the possibility of granting freedom.

Note: In each step, I say "allows possibility," I don't mean to say it will happen easily or without pressure. Instead, I am making the more limited claim that without achieving claim 0 or claim 1, there is no point to direct pressure for freedom.


But here is the tricky part.  Few governments anywhere in the world (arab, european, american) will bother pushing very much towards a goal they don't believe in.  And one thing Israelis and Palestinians agree upon is that the two state solution is dead.

For #0 and #1 to be true, Israel would need to be dramatically different in how it treats Palestinians, and Palenstinians would need a strong government committed to ensuring peace and the world would need to commit to helping Palestinians out of the economic pit they are in.  None of these things seem remotely close to happening.  Indeed I don't see credible plans for nearly any of them.

So what is the plan?  Shout into the wind about the injustice of it all and know that we supported the correct side?

I want a real plan.  Mine is modest but it does NOT require either side to believe the other will actually fulfull their side of the full plan, and this is a good thing.  Right now neither side has any belief in the intentions or ability of the other side.

Again let me agree the Palestinians have ample reason for their beliefs, but I assure you, BOTH sides have these beliefs strongly, and NOTHING will happen on a two state solution while both sides continue with those beliefs.

So what is the plan?  what is the plan?

My plan is modest, but it moves both groups towards belief that both #0 and #1 are possible.  (only for the Enclave) but no larger action is even possible until #0 and #1 are believed and seen in action.  






My plan is a long slow and unfair plan.  it has nothing going for it, except it does not require either side to actually believe in it in order to start. (with pressure)

No other plan I have heard is like that.  and other plans will continue to come to nothing until beliefs (and actions) are changes.










It was not dead 20 years ago, I think it could have happened, but now it will require a very strong Gazan government to monitor the tens of thousands of ex-Hamas who believe violence is the way.

Now of course you are right, the reason they believe this is because of their treatment.  I acknowledge this.  But it does not change the reality.  and even if the world massively pressured Israel to dismantle all settlements, give good water rights, and many other things, robust monitoring would still be needed.

And presently Gaza does not have a government aiming for this.  Again we can blame 70 years of occupation for this sure, but it is a reality.

So the plan needs to 





Popular opinion of folks like me and you have notable, but limited ability to move governments to action.  And that ability is move governments to action.  And most of that leverage is lost when those populations are as divided as they are on this issue.  

The path I propose would require governments to supply billions over time to economically support this enclave,

I stopped responding because your framing is ridiculous and you seem so
dug in on it there's no point in arguing with it. Even here, all you've done is
changed one completely arbitrary number for another.
1000 with motivating desire to kill Israeli citizens? Okay, how about 999? Or
500? How do we find out whether these people exist? Do we include the
question, "Do you have motivating desire to kill thousands of Israeli citizens" on a
poll?
Most importantly, and this is the key point for me, are you seriously naive
enough to imagine that if the Palestinians meet this 1000-person threshold,
the Israelis will suddenly start acting in good faith and acknowledge/end the
litany of crimes (the occupation, the settlers, the apartheid) that they've been
committing for decades?

You talk about Palestinian "motivating desire" to kill Israelis but refuse to
acknowledge why that desire exists.
Palestinians hate Israel as an extremely direct and completely
understandable result of what Israelis have done to them. The end. So to
frame the solution to this as doing nothing until the Palestinians forgive
these decades of oppression, all without demanding that the Israelis do
anything to make amends, is preposterous.
Israel will be safe from attacks when it makes a genuine attempt at peace
that recognises the humanity and rights of the Palestinians. Funnily enough,
I recently saw an interview with Jimmy Carter saying almost exactly the
same thing eighteen years ago. I wish, for all concerned, that Israel had
listened to him then.
