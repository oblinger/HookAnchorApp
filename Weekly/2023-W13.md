Paul, I don't mean to pick to hard, it just this is an interesting topic and I wanted to understand it better, but I don't think I did.

And for me, I think one would just need to slow down and spell things out more.  You are a philosopher (I guess?), but you are writing in Medium where I feel I shouldn't be too much less informed than the average reader.  Yet I am not up to the task.  so you are writing as an apple, but your readers are only capable of comprehending oranges.


You told us about uncompromising vs compromising reductionism.

or the idea of one area being 'more fundamental' than another.

Scientism?

grand vs petty reductionism.   (maybe I get this one... maybe)

exceptions to the rule of reductionism?  (do we definitively know these?!?)


then you talk about examples of removing neurons or bricks from houses not making much difference.  ok, but try removing a single electrical connection within a microprocessor. or one extra butterfly wing flap to the weather and see how long the whole thing keeps running.  It seems one cannot generalize about this sensitivity of composite systems to tiny alterations of its parts.  Right?

multiple realizability???

mild reductionism about chemistry???


to change.
