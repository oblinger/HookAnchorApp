Well she certainly looks potentially qualified, maybe over qualified.  More a researcher than an engineer-action person.  Still she easily could be both.  But I am guessing she is 3x over our salary-target, so Michael I would aim first to just get a bead on that number before spending time on anything else.  Because we are hiring remote, you might even just let her know that all of our folks are under 10K/mo and we understand if getting into that range is just not possible.  If she got close or just a bit above *MAYBE* we could consider it.  But I think she will roll her eyes at such numbers.
