NEEDLE MOVERS

Team, I am hoping to get us focused on attacking parts of our system that will "move the needle" on overall accuracy.  My idea is that most of us should be working on an aspect of our system that could possibly make some kind of large improvement, and I want to be sure we are not ignoring important parts of the problem.  In service of this, I am trying to capture a list of all areas where we think large improvements could occur.  [[HERE]] 


Happy New Year Siobhan!  Hope your holidays were awesome, we spent an extended period the Grandma and Grandpa, it was great, but also exhausting :-)

I wanted to check in to see if you were able to put in a good for us at Alta Vista?  It remains high on our list, so I want to make sure we had help we can in getting in.

Blessings in 2024


Dear St. Paul’s Elementary School:

  

Our 4 year old is a student at Big City Montessori School, and we are thinking about where we might send him to Kindergarten as this is his last year there.

We are partitioners at St. Dominic’s so sending our son Eli to a Catholic school near our home would be very nice.  Do you have any kind of school tour or open house for the school
