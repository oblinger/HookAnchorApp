Atsuko,

You barely know me, so if you prefer I work through someone else, I totally understand.

Her any my connection was an important one, I think she deserves a proper good goodbye...  at least if that is still possible.  I am guessing you think I should NOT reach out to her parents, perhaps that is right.  They are just the only people that know me well and also speak English.

Mostly it would be good to know how quickly things are changing for Yoshiko?  I am assuming I should aim to only give her one message?  




For both Yoshiko and myself

Thanks!  Can you provide a link to your yelp reviews, and what is your per hour


for ongoing regular cleaning do you have an hourly rate and a min number of hours?
