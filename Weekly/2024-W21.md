SETUP SIMPLICITY
Jack noticed the difference in cost for androids and SaveMyPlay.  Separate from this, I want to explore this issue of setup simplicity a bit more @Alan Arlt, @Jack Ryan Potvin, @James Sullivan (and any others too).  I am not focused on the PRESENT complexity of these two paths, instead I want to understand if we modified them to have lowest possible friction how would they compare?  Both have been setup to wake up ready to record.

For comparison  for both dual android and dual SaveMyPlay setups lets assume:
we have a battery pack and A/C adapter available for both.
we have strong and adjustable holders for phone & cameras that mount onto a tripod bar or wall mount for both.
For SaveMyPlay we have control buttons on camera.
For android we have an app that auto starts on boot and simply has buttons for start stop recording.

For this comparison we assume we have adjusted the record app so it only has buttons to start and stop recording, (and maybe a delete last recording button), and it does show what the camera is seeing for proper alignment.  The phone is modified so there is no login and this app just runs as soon as the phone is powered on.

Now with this hypothetical setup do you think the android is still more finicky to setup, or did that get rid of the issues
