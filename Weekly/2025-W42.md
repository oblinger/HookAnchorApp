Roja:
Sorry to hear of your frustrations with One Password and wish you the best with whatever is next.  Indeed, your frustrations gave pause for a second reason:  My husband (CTO/PhD in AI) has been chatting with me in recent weeks about how he thinks One Password might benefit from changes in this fast-moving field.

He was prepping to chat with you when I got your sad news.  He wanted a 'gut check' to see if his thinking aligns with 1Password's leadership and the constraints on the ground.

If you have the time for a short chat with him, I think he would value your input.  And of course, he will understand if it's just not the right time for such a chat.

Best of luck in your next chapter!
Qingling
