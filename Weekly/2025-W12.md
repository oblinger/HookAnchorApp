Dan - we're doing a video for the crowd round.  Could I get :30 mins with you this week to riff on a few topics?  1. hearing in your voice how hard the challenges we are working on really are.  2. optimism for the progress we've made against the premise.  other topic ideas: skepticism at first, learnings, surprises, technical complexity, bullish about future of AI. patents, intellectual property, 180k lines of code.

HOW HARD
- elbows and ankles then a ball pops out of the shot
- manual reviewer... find the hair and arm of the player out of the scrum.
- existing algs not really designed for this
-  watch the hair of that player 

OUR APPROACH
- 


OPTIMISM FOR PROGRESS
- We have nailed many parts of the analysis task and great quarter or quarter progress on others.
- What to report here?
