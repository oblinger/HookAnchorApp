Strengths:

Sarthi is a team player, very willing to dig into any aspect of any problem which will have greatest benefit for the team overall.  Very able and willing to take precise direction and be responsive.  Sarthi is able to understand and collaborate on novel algorithms design.

Weaknesses:

Sarthi is less able to debug complex interactions and bugs within our system, and thus needs support in executing such tasks, and as the most junior member of our team is less able to formulate a strong plan of attack without significant guidance.

The impact of this second limitation is greatly reduced by Sarthi's humble nature and excellent skills in collaborating effectively with others.  The overall effect is that we end up performing at a pretty high level in combination, but at a reduced velocity.


NOTE:  saying the second part about significant guidance directly to Sarthi should be done with care.  I would not want him trying to prove he could operate w/ less guidance, that would lower is value notably.
