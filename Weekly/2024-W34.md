INJECTING QA INTO AT TESTING:
@Jack Ryan Potvin, @Juan Barajas and @Juli: Normally with SW we would involve QA in the process of debugging a new feature.  Perhaps we should be doing the same thing here with AI?  Are we at a point with the system where QA could meaningfully trigger AI minutes and wait for the result, and (OPTIONAL: perhaps even look at logging info).  My thought is that longer term we are going to want to have a process where the dev says it is working and QA is testing it. (not you Jack).

But are we at that point now?  Thoughts?
