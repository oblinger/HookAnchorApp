:100:%  agree on your point about bites on the apple, and on your assessment of our accuracy in targeting good products.  For the moment, i am just gathering data on possibilities w/o any aim to actually DO them.  but I take it, that you think a highlights products is not a big seller.  got it.

what bothers me is that balltime has grown their business based on AI-stats that are quite crappy.  at least in the beginning.  They did not use humans as their baseline.  they just sold an app that was a great way to view a VB game, and the customers accepted what they got.  (of course their price point was quite good too!)

I just wonder if we have gone down a wrong road when starting with a good-as-humans product and baseline???
