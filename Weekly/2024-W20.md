OKRS
- Infrastructure: Dockerization, AI-dispatchers, much yet to me done


PRODUCT STATUS

Real Play
- 85-88% Play Recall. 

Minutes
- 8% error rate 
- game breaks in
- free throws look like GB



INNOVATION COPMPONENTS

Panorama-based homo Stabilized & made robust
- Absolute player/ball velocity
- Now used in AI-minutes
- Caching & Interpolation

Homography [notebook](https://www.notion.so/sportsvisio/24Q2-Maxim-s-Homography-Notebook-e43a1733bbc94c7cb55b40d5e64d9fc2?pvs=4) 
- Trained on 8 courts - 
  Eval 18 courts:  245 low, 478 mid, 240 high, 460 Mid-Fixed


OCR Improvement
- 40-45% fewer hallucinations - at tracklet level


PROTOTYPES
- Play Chart / Shot Chart
- Shotboxer
- Temm
- Halos

CTO - John Spade
AU pro sports
- baseball, volleyball, basketball, lacrosse
- 720p 60fps,
- He tracks ball speed
- He is paying $20K for 6 guns (w/ operator)
	- per sport per season
- He needs in near real time.
	- volleyball speed
	- couple of seconds
	- 90% percent of the time within 90% speed accuracy
- He has three other sports
- Player Sprinting Speed, 

~~
Narrating sports after the fact or in real time

METRIC: mse of hoop


- Compute 26-point-based homography
  (all x, y below are assumed in this homography)
- for all frame in video:
	- compute the center of the key:  K_x, K_y
	- compute the lowest and highest value key corners:  (L_x, L_y) and (H_x, H_y)
	- for all "green" lines (that might be the "long" edges of the court)
		- Compute the length=L and centroid=(C_x, C_y) of the segment
		- If L < min_length: discard_segment
		- Compute the "court ratio" for each green segment:
			- CR = abs( (C_y-K_y) / (H_y-K_y) )



- First set of games they gave us were much sharper
- Base detector wrong
	- not detected; bat
- Radius for at bat wrong


1. home plate prediction is wrong
   (handedness right will be wrong)
2. No OCR results

- Get payload for best video
- hardcode home-plate

## DONE
