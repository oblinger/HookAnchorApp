@Michael Seibert ok!  then we will propose a system using Ball tracking, person tracking, AND pose estimation.  I like it!  Still I am think trying to identify the tracklet that has ball possession is probably easier than identifying change in posession.  In order to do that they will need to know which tracklets belong to different people.  We could have associating tracklets as level one, and identifying change of possession as a stregth 
Hey, @mig don't be biting your tongue!  Let's think this stuff thru and make our best plans.  This is my thinking:
- Of all the users segment and all ingest approaches I think it can be boiled down to four key cases:  Cloud, Fixed, Mobile, TryBeforeBuy
- We have errored in trying to build scaled software as a first step.  Instead I want to build human driven first versions of all four as a first step, then allow actual sales growth drive prioritization of automation.

So I was not prioritizing fixed first.  I was just prioritizing which ever one I could get live THIS WEEK first.  My try-before-you-by "share button" approach is also one that I think we can do with ZERO code.  Thus a plan is to essentially do that one at the same time as fixed cameras with the ops team.  I was focusing a bit more on the fixed camera one, just because it was a bit more complex to get all the parts ready.  But really the plan is to have the ops team ramping up on BOTH of those cases at the same time.

I know there will be many bumps in making this work well, so I am anxious to just have someone NOW trying to do these flows.

And of course we already have a Cloud ingest working regularly with Cerebro games.  And right now the Portable solution is kinda kicking my butt, I will save discussion of that for another note.

TL;DR.  I am not trying doing fixed first, I am trying to do them ALL manually now.

Thoughts on this from anyone?




.  I am trying hard to not have sports visio assembly required, but the UX I am able to create with devices I am finding (even looking)


J & S:

FIXED CAMERA RAMP UP
Should we accelerate our ingestion ramp up?

Mark if we have fully automated fixed-camera ingestion working today, how quickly could you find customers?

Miguel has been hard at work getting a BPO setup to automate our game ingestion, but he estimates 4-6 before they can start work with us, and of course that timeline could slip.  Today Achilles solved the last issue in manually ingesting games from fixed cameras.  I don't want to wait 4-6 weeks to begin working out the kinks in the process, I would like to be regularly ingesting fixed camera games today.  What resource do we have inside the team that could learn this task, execute it, and teach Miguel's team when they are ready?



already 55% 



- Shots the don't count (time outs)
- Player ID no where in sight
- Player ID not unique


- Shot detectors (block shot)
- Other algorithms not working

@Grzegorz Biziel I was thinking about the bounding problem 


@maxim what do you need in order to do good training here?  Lets write up some sentences as a spec to Realplay.  e.g. how many different games?  We want to tell them they should "cover the range of variation" but it will be good to give them examples of differences they should consider.  e.g. different resolutions, different camera angles, different lighting conditions, etc.  what matters the most for them to cover?  Can you write some sentences that I will forward to them as a request?  thx!!
