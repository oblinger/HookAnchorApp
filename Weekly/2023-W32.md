I like it!  I see no issues with the Syversen focus, you are our brand so it is kind of like saying "sports visio thinks..."  And I think our DARPA experience and your and Sam's Seige experience are the big ticket claims for our team.

I think we can own the "Augmented Reality" connection though this is mostly an aspirational connection at this point.  Calling us a "Generative AI" company is pretty hard to support based on what we are doing.  In theory we COULD use generative AI to put flames on the basketball or such (though this might cost too much to regularly do), but GENERATIVE ai just doesn't fit the UNDERSTANDING that most of our system does.  (We don't want to GENERATE fictitious stats after all ;-) ). We are a deep tech AI company, so maybe we just use the buzz word of the moment and don't worry that really we cannot support that claim.

Alternatively we CAN own Deep Learning or Augmented Reality instead.  I don't think Augmented Reality is cool enough, and Deep Learning is a bit dated.  We ARE heavily using Transformers which are key to the generative AI revolution.  So under the covers what we are doing is using pretty cutting edge stuff.  You might just decide to ignore this logical inaccuracy and call it Generative AI.
