Broadly we expect Preston to be working with our front end team supporting our web apps.

(1) Initially Preston will be learning angular.
(2) Then delivering a couple demo screens that exercise this new skill.
(3) we have two dashboards specified on our roadmap for our "Manager App" for Preston to work on and deliver.
(4) After this it will be "duties as assigned" (likely within the Angular Web apps space)
