Jason’s Sport priorities! (Oct 18th 2023)  
_Full AI definition: "Almost all the stats that you care about, but could be missing 1-2 things (like minutes) that are important... as long as you still have plenty of people paying for it & proving it's valuable as is"_  

1. Full AI full stats basketball
2. Full AI a second top 10 sport OR Full AI for a subset of a real significant streaming sports by player replay type deal (Baller TV)
3. If cant get something in full AI, would take full AI for something else smaller like Baseball showcase.
4. If cant do 1,2 or 3. show better margin improvements with partial usefully AI.

1. Ex: Shot Tips, Halos
