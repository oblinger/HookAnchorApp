Both of us are on the older side as parents. Dan is 59 and hopes to retire at 65 while Eli will only be 11 years old.  Thus we are trying to rearrange or finances to save enough for retirement while still supporting Eli through his school years. Unfortunately, Dan's company cut his salary in half starting September 2024 from an already pretty low level in the Bay Area, and his company does not provide any benefits, let alone retirement benefits.
  
With all the mandatory costs such as house loan payment, property tax, tuition, food etc, we are draining our savings account, we are trying to rearrange our monthly spending so we can save some for retirement during this period. We really love what AVS is doing for Eli, especially on the social emotional learning side so we are looking for ways to really shift our finances to make staying at AVS work longer term.

NOTE: Last year we did not understand the loan process properly, so we missed the deadline to be considered even though we did put our information after the fact.


and would love to be able to keep him there if all possible.
