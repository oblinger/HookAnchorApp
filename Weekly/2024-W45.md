AI MINUTE ALPHA TESTING
@James Sullivan I know last week we had a failure because the AI-pipe did not retry, and a bug in training.  As far as you know, are the only games failing that we need to debug are #13 and #14.  Are there any others?

Also we have pushed a new version of the code.  Are we going to hit our ten game alpha testing quota this week?  What days will the tests hit on?
