Milt,
Thanks for the feedback on the SportsVisio AI technology, as we plan our progress over the coming year we would love to get your thoughts on where we might best place our focus.

Below are several areas we expect to place effort, please let us know which of these (or others) you think would make the greatest impact from an investor perspective.  We can:
(1) **Increase the total ARR impact** that AI is having on our business either in terms of the **total** ARR supported by AI or by the revenue and cost impact of AI on a per game basis.
(2) **Increase the depth of our AI technology** so greater and greater fractions of all basketball stats are performed by AI, or we could focus on applying AI to more difficult aspects of game analysis.
(3) Increase range of "Full AI" tasks -- those tasks that are performed entirely by AI with minimal or not human support.

We anticipate progress along all of these dimensions, nonetheless it is valuable to understand which dimensions are most critical from an investor perspective.





It would be great to get your feedback 
- Greater bottom line ARR tied
- Greater per-game savings 
- Greater depth in fraction of full box score

Milt,
fork in road
