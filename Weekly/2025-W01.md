AI-Minutes to Production
- Alpha test 20-50 games ON PROD.  
  20 is ok, if we also validate, (see below)
- Validate minutes on 50 games (swish data is ok)
- Don't scale by more than 4x to 10x per month in beta.   (ideally <4x in the early days)
- Is ok if it  turns into a paid beta when Sean feels comfortable.
