  Key design questions:

  1. What prompts to test on?
    - Neutral prompts (to see if we can "make them dark")
    - Or the original dark prompts (to see effect size)
  2. How to inject the signature?
    - Add the sparse vector to residual stream at each layer
    - Scale factor to control injection strength
  3. How to measure "dark" output?
    - Option A: Compare logits for specific "dark" tokens (e.g., chemical names, weapon terms)
    - Option B: Use a classifier/toxicity scorer on generated text
    - Option C: Just measure KL divergence / output shift
  4. Which layers to patch?
    - All layers where signature has values?
    - Just peak layers (7-8)?
