Write a function that accepts the path to a markdown file and returns a Dict[str, str].  
- The function parses the markdown file into the following parts:
FRONT_LINES_STRING
COLON_LINES
MID_LINES_STRING
SECTIONS

- Each colon line is string containing ":: " in the line.
- SECTIONS is a list of sections that each begin with a line that starts "### " with one or more "#" marks.  if the ### line also has a ":" then the text before it is the "key" else the key is "_NNN" where NNN is a unique integer. 
- The "value" for a section is the string contents including its beginning "### " and its optional key, all they way upto the next section.
- The function returns a dict with a key value pair for each section and a key 'front' whose value is the FRONT_LINES_STRING and key 'min' whose value is MID_LINES_STRING.
