## FOO
**Quick** spec:

M1(time, p) returns true iff exists annotation, ann, such that time, low <= time <= high and low <= time_of(ann) <= high where [low, high] in active_game_intervals

Dans_M1(time, p) = M1(floor(minute/60)*60, p) or  M1(floor(minute/60)*60+1, p) 

M2(time, p) returns true iff exists annotation, ann, such that abs( time - time_of(ann) ) < 5 * 60


matrix for metric M:   TP, FP  are the log of the counts scaled to 1 for that metric.   so  log_e( TP / (TP+FP)). and   log_e( FP / (TP+FP)). 
Same calculation for FP and FN.

These calculations are computed for both M1, M2 and Dans_M1

score(Mx, time, p) = Mx_TP if time is predicted on court else Mx_TN

player_score(p) = sum score(Dans_M1, time, p) + score(Dans_M2, time, p). for every time in a game.

(this player score can also be computed for every second within the game using metric M1 instead of Dans_M1)


Maybe the score for a whole game is the average of the worse three player scores for that game.
