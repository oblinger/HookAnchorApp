TAXES:

Here are the wire transactions I see:
NOV-17-2021  $250,000.54     (my 33% of cash @ sale minus holdback)
NOV-30-2022  $83,333.51      (this is my 33% of 250K holdback)
NOV-30-2022  $475,754.62     (my 33% of $1,427K AF account)


Nick, by eyeball does this look consistent with the payments you received?  Does it seem to capture everything?


Vijaya, you can see what Nick wrote to me below.  The reason this was in installments is because the original sale of the company was for $1M in cash, with a $250K hold back.  So you can see the three transactions I received for the company was:
- the cash for the company (minus holdback)
- the hold back given later
- the cash in our back account for the company

I think this explains why we had a schedule, and those amounts are wire transfers into my checking account.  Do we have other questions to ask to my original accountant Moss Adams or is all of this clear now?  Let me know, I can easily write to them for further clarification.

Thanks!!
