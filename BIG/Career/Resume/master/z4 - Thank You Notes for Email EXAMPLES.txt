It was such a pleasure meeting you in person yesterday. Thank you again for taking the time to discuss the position and to confirm for me what your expectations are for the [division / department] team, as well as for [broader industry type] specifically.

The day was awesome and I'm excited about the possibility of joining your team, as well as what I could accomplish as [Company Name]'s [Position Title in Question].

Have a great weekend.
