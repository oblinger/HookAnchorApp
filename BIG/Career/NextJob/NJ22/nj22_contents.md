#### 2021.10.01 - -- SITUATION SUMMARY --

The business I own is going to transition (in a good way) soon, so I need to select my next adventure.

I need to understand the realism of some paths I am considering.
My enthusiasm for a job can be quite hot or cold based on details of that job, so I need to strategize to craft a good path.


=== BACKGROUND ===

**MY SITUATION**
- I have leadership experience and Phd in: AI/Machine Learning/Robotics.
- The company I founded will transition, so I need a new gig.
  
  **PRIOR PLAN**
- **BIG-DIFFERENT** -- think thru secondary problems around central insight
- **JUST-DO-ONE** --
- **LIFESTYLE INCOME** -- Obtain moderate/sufficient lifestyle income, then persue realization of ideas based on impact, not based on income potential.
- **HALF-EFFORTS** --
- **PATH NOW IN DOUBT** -- Marriage, Child, Bay area costs, Business transition all cast this plan into grave doubt.
  
  **COGNITIVE DISSONANCE**
- **EMPERORS-NEW-CLOTHES** -- Verbal, Deep, Fast, Broad, 
  	Depth-to-avoid-Bordom, Flighty/Slow/Sprinter, TooVerbose/Complex, 
  	Execution Exp, Too willing to express Negative
- **GROWN-LAZY** -- 
  
  **POSSIBLE PATHS FORWARD**
- **KMCO** -- Start my own company based in knowledge management.
- **FAANG** -- Well paid AI guy in a big co (as manager or individual contributor)
- **CTO** -- Several opportunies are in front of me.
  
  **MY PASSION PROJECT**
- **10+ YRS OF HEAVY SIDE WORK** -- An approach for socially constructed software
- **KNOWLEGE MANAGEMENT STARTUP** -- Side work could provide basis for a startup
- **THREE SEPERABLE SIDES TO THIS PASSION**
	- UNIFORM -- An technical approach for building interoperable SW languages
	- KM -- A Knowlege management product for used by individuals&corporations
	- MKT -- A marketplace that maximizes participant pay not capital profits
	  
	  **ABOUT ME**
- **ALWAYS IDEATING / SHORT ON EXECUTION** -- By far the KM thread is deepest of all my interests, but my M-O is to forever consider societal problems, and try to find a key insight to break the impasse then flesh the insight out towards a solution.  I will go VERY (way too) deep in considering if ...  how this new solution might operate.  Most excited when I feel I have hit upon some _**novel insight**_ leverage on a long standing problem.  Such insights do not come at command, they come randomly, thus these interest are extremely randomly distributed, (and not that tied to my area of training).
  	==> My (and other's) assessment is that these ideas are novel and valuable,
  yet the overall outcome is negligable w/o followup execution.
- **IDEAS ARE BIG / HARD TO MONETIZE** -- feel my largest contributions would happen if I need not try to simultaneouly earn personal money from projects.
- **OTHER EXAMPLE IDEAS**
	- **EDUCORP** -- Self-funded education & business ownership for the very poor
	- **TEAMSAVER** -- Remote-work with in-person like interpersonal connectivity
	- **FINANCIAL NEEDS**
- **MONEY IN THE BANK** -- Have saved couple million that provide 6-figure salary
- **IN BAY AREA W/ NEW BABY** -- But I live in bay area with a young kid and a wife working at Google, but expecting private schools etc.
- WAS EXPLICIT BEFORE MARRIAGE --
