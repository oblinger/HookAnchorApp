#### Locust projects
		    --  Bitcoin trading platform  -->  $1K+/month profit
		    --  Brain2  -->  Able to map NLP phrases into actions or states of some world
		    --  Config  -->  


		Locust projects part of NDL
		-- Once I put in 3+ mo FTE while under NDL, then yes unofficially.
		   --> if we start take in *real* customers or investors, then it becomes official.
		   --> main objective is if NDL efforts/activities fade away after only a bit of
		       official activities, then I am free to continue that idea at a later time
		       w/o NDL encumberances.
		   (Obviously if we ever collected real money 100K+ as part of NDL, then some
		    kind of consideration would be needed, or NDL would always be in cap table or
		    something.)

#### Incorporating

		- LLC -- Simplest.  no second tax return.  
		  strongest protections from liability

#### Compensation

------
		GOOGLE COMPENSATION
		Yes for Egnor because he's pre-ipo and senior staff.  I'm 2 levels down, post-ipo with total comp 250-300 largely due to favorable stock growth.  
		Spector is one of a dozen senior vp's.  He's in a whole different league.

		But if I'm your peer you're off by a factor of 1.5-2.  Similar to me are many ex-IBMers with 20-30 years of experience now at google .
		Consultants don't get health coverage and related benefits.  Also it's a limited term opportunity.  So many reasons for higher rate than google rate.

		A newly hired director (like senior staff but mgr) might get base of 300 with 1M of stock over 4 years.  So cases exist but you're 
		talking about 10% of your peers not all.

		Happy Hunting!
### Doug - compensation question
		------
		HIGH END CONSULTANT COMPENSATION

		This is such a tricky question.  Everyone I have asked it of has told me it is tricky, and managed to evade actually quoting any numbers. I'm not going to do that. 
		The conventional wisdom is that you shouldn't be looking for a daily (or hourly) rate, you should be making value-based proposals.  Propose some work, then price it by value.  For yourself, estimate the effort it will take.  You are then correctly incentivised to figure out how to economize on the performance.  I get this answer pretty much every time I ask the question. 
		In my own personal experience, I beg to differ.  I have made proposals where I am able to compute pretty well the amortization schedule of the work I am proposing (by comparing the costs of the outcome vs. service offerings in the marketplace that they would need to engage to cover for not having had the word done up-front).  While this schedule was accepted, it was way out of budget (by about 6:1!).  So no deal.
		I currently have a small contract that I am doing on this basis. It has taken months to organize it (I have been tracking the business development time, so I can calculate my actual costs).  Even considering all that, I was able to quote  a price that undercut my competition while providing me with an effective hourly rate that is very good.  But I'm not sure that it is really that much better than quoting a time-and-materials hour rate. 
		So, on to numbers.  TopQuadrant has registered with a GSA schedule, which means that their service fees are now a matter of public record.  Their top fee, which is the PhD working at the level that their experience and education merit, is $250/hour (I might be off by a few $ here, I didn't look it up just now, I'm working from memory).  I have found that that rate makes most people balk.  I have also heard from some of TQ's partners in large projects that their rates are known for being high.  
		So - as I negotiated with the bank for my current gig, I ended up at $180/hour (which is going through a contracting house, so they actually pay something like $200/hour).  I have been told that if I get a better offer, to come back to them. I haven't done that.  Keep in mind that this rate is one that I get for 20-40 hrs/week for the course of several months at a time, so I am getting a lot of stability at that number.  
		So, there are the parameters - I'll let you figure out your numbers from there.

### Chronology Of Notes

		  * 16.09.14 -- Cory question
		Cory,

		a question about PhP salaries.  I am starting to look for people for my photo editing idea.
		Really I need lightly skilled folks to do basic photo editing.  Would not even need
		a bachelors degree, but perhaps I am better off looking for folks who have that background?


		For people in the manila area, who have a bachelor's degree, but who are NOT currently 
		working in a good paying job.  What hourly rate would be the lowest I could try to charge
		and still get people who were reasonably good, and reasonably responsible?

		what would be a standard salary for a person w. a bachelor's?

		what would be a good salary?

##### 13.07.31 -- In Thailand


		The 500-pound gorrillas
		- Need to be getting from the job:  
		  - Technical Challenge. 
		  - OCD-like desire for efficiency and 'right config'
		  - Being important / delivering something important

		- Able to retire in ten years

		- Desire to get off the treadmill, and do what?
		  - Projects that I love:  hack the mac.  config.  brain2



_
##### 13.07.31 -- Next projects

		BRAIN2 -- Get funding work two years to produce demo system
		- Sources:  DARPA, 

		CONFIG -- as a side project in Google.
		- Could I build and 'own' some core concept of config
		  prior to google.  Then work on an open source version while
		  at google?
		  - OWN the 'github' server -- the primary default one used by lang
		    and the only one that allowed to be a market place.
