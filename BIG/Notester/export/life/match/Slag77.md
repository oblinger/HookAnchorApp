    THE BASICS: I just finished up my Ph.D. and now work at IBM doing 
    research on how technology can reach those missed by today's 
    classrooms. I'm 5'10", 165lbs, physically fit, clean cut. 
     
     
     
    Here is my wrapup of several questions. 
     
      THE BASICS: I just finished 
    up my Ph.D. and work at IBM doing research on how technology can reach 
    those missed by today's classrooms. I'm 5'10", 165lbs, physically fit, 
    clean cut. I like to play dress up, but in that not-trying-too-hard 
    sort of way.  
     
    ADJECTIVES THAT BEST DESCRIBE ME: Positive/Energetic -- The first to 
    want to go out and the last to want to leave. Optimistic/Trusting -- 
    The one people seem to tell those secrets that they have "never told 
    anyone before." Ambitious -- Enjoy pushing myself, and get a bit 
    restless when life's groove gets a little too deep. Thinking -- if I 
    know about it, I have an opinion, and if don't know about it, I want 
    to.
