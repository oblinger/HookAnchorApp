    Minjoo,  
    I am a believer that 
    I've been looking for the right time and place. 
    I believe in  
     
    Minjoo, 
     
    Its a bit funny to write a letter to someone that sleeps 20 feet away,  
    but as any good lawyer would point out, you can be much more precise in 
    writing. 
     
        I like you.   
     
        More than a few of the things that make you unique are also  
        things important to me.  Of course it is not for me to say, 
        but it also seems that the reverse it true too. 
     
        SURPRISE! 
     
    There has never been an opportunity for this thought to surface. 
    But it's been there in the back of my head. 
    It was there when we played go-stop at your house.   
    It was there when we tore hapless poor clams off a rock in the Pacific. 
    It was there when I told you 'of course the guys in NY will be interested!' 
    And I see occasional flashes of it clearly in the conversations we have now. 
     
    BUT: 
    I am not saying this expecting it to make a difference. 
    I am bright enough to see that it won't and can't make a difference right now. 
    I am saying it now because I think this could be my last chance to say it. 
    I am saying it now so I won't regret keeping my silence later. 
     
     
    SO: 
    * Don't get a big head! 
    * Don't TELL anyone. (Yes I am certain you want to brag.  resist it!) 
    * Don't tell Marsha--don't tell Shawn. 
    * Don't do ANYTHING differently. 
    In fact, just go ahead and tear this puppy up right now! 
     
    Seriously, the only reason *not* to tell you this, is because I don't 
    want to screw up a great thing.  I love the interesting/deep/laid-back  
    conversations we have, and I love having you as a roomate. 
    Please don't let this silly note affect either! 
     
    Your roomate and friend, 
    Dan

    Absolutely candid advice it sought here! 
     
    Ok, so here is the plan: 
    * I am going to hand write the note below. 
    * I am going to wait until we are an hour or two away from going out 
      to a party or some low key public function where. 
    * I am going to get a large glass of scotch (for both of us) and 
    * I am going to deliver this bomb shell. 
    * I will sit there patiently while she reads it. 
    * I will field any questions she has with a bit of a smirk 
      (and I will down play any consequeces of the whole thing) 
    * Then we go to the party together 
     
    *All* parts of this plan are open for negotiation, (including the 
    existance of the whole thing!) 
     
    I didn't want to do it as a letter, but I could never say this right 
    otherwise.
