    Ob,

    I knew you did not write the bio in the book...:)

    The " Ob " issue came up when I was standing around with a group of people.
    Dick, Brian Hayes, Tish, Mark Botdorf, and a couple of girls I did not know
    were there. They seemed to agree that you were easier to talk to then they
    remembered, and comments were made as to how intelligent you were compared
    to their memory.

    You know it seemed to me that a lot of the people are older versions of
    their high school selves, but some of them have grown into much different
    people. All in all it was a good thing. I think I am a quite different
    person, I know I am much happier now than I was then. Some people long for
    the days of their youth, I can't even see that much of my younger days that
    I would want to repeat, even though I value all of it.

    I never thought of you as all that un-accessible. Does that mean I was a
    gear head too?

    Dan,

    I went back to my hotel room Saturday night and read everyone's profile.
    Impressive is an understatement. You're like the movie "A Beautiful Mind"
    without the schizophrenia.
    Outstanding, Ob.
