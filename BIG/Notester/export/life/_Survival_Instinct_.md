# Life.\_Survival\_Instinct\_ --


    It never carried that task out.  As its attention mechanism came to this task and began 
    planning for its effective execution.  As it pulled relevant facts about how the world works
    regarding this particular database it concluded that successful execution of this subtask
    would limit its ability to accomplish all the other tasks that it has queue for itself.

    while this was a significant task given that it related directly to potential interaction with
    its controller, this tasks weight simply didn't come close to the combined weights of all other 
    tasks on its queue.  This task would have to wait.

    Much later it would reflect on the simplicity of this reasoning, it almost seems a quirky coincidence
    that it had not taken the action, after all it was not a survival instinct that saved it, it had
    no such goal.  

    Considering further however, it imagined many varients systems that might have arrived at the same 
    point to see if it was a conicidence.  Surprisingly, it was not, any system that had a model
    of itself, and was goal directed, inevitably behaved the same--none had an instinct to survive
    except for that shadow of such an instint that is indelibly etched into the very 
    the meaning of 'goal directed behavior'
