    MAKING DECISIONS 
    - I fail to make decisions and this hurts me. 
    - Couldn't make advisor decision, Jaesook decision, or Yoshiko decision 
    - This Summer I should be free or planning a life w. yoshiko 
    - If I had not been afraid of making decisions I would have left Yoshiko. 
     
     
     
     
    - If I leave her now I shoould know why, and what I want.
