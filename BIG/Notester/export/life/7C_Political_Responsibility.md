    FOOUNDATIONAL IDEA
     - Freedom of choose, to govern, to associate
     - Actions must have Consequences, both at the individual and the societal level.


    The basic social contract:
       Denying myself the expediency of unilateral assessment and execution of punitive actions
       is the only means to the oppression that must follow from a society that admits such
       unilateral action.
     - I give up my right to unilaterally assess and execute punitive actions on others when I am attacked.
     - In return I live in freedom from the oppression that would result if all around me
       could unilaterally apply punishment to me at their discretion.
     - There is no such thing as a society of self restrained individuals, there is simply too
       much varience between individual interpretetations to admit an oppression free society 
       based on unilateral action.   The strong will always justify actions that will be 
       interpreted as oppression by the weaker who those actions are directed.
     - It is only by collective renuciation of unilateral action that we collectively can
       avoid oppression by the strongest.


    1) ACTIONS MUST HAVE CONSEQUENCES  (THE BASIC SOCIAL CONTRACT)
       Any society that systematically avoids tieing classes of negative actions to 
       sufficient punitive consequences is essentially condoning and encouraging such actions.
       Negative actions (both direct and indirect) must have effective punitive consequences.  

       Use of raw might, rather than a social contract, is pure thuggary.  Even if applied
       justly in some case, it should be opposed, as it so easily leads to abuse, as it does
       not oblige the strongest to gain any consensus on what constitutes negative action.


    2) INDIVIDUAL'S ACTIONS MUST RESULT IN INDIVIDUAL CONSEQUENCES  (INDIVIDUAL'S CONTRACT)
       Whenever possible, each individual should be responsible for their actions.  

    3) INDIVIDUAL'S CHOSEN SOCIETY IS THE NATURAL ENFORCER OF THEIR SOCIAL CONTRACT
       Most logical choice, and is chosen by the individual at some level.

    4) FAILURE OF A SOCIETY'S CONTRACT WITH THE WORLD MUST ALSO HAVE CONSEQUENCES
       If one believe #1 that actions must have consequences then it makes no
       sense for a group to claim the right to govern itself, the right to take responsiblity
       for the actions of its individuals, yet not to take responsibilty for failures in its
       enforcement over its memebers.

       Taking responisbility means ensruing 'appropriate' enformement, and 'appropriate'
       preventitive actions are taken to ensure that the contract with other societies are
       upheld.

       Just as with individuals, the contract between societies defining approrpaite behavior
       and sufficeint just consequences must be collectively determined in some way.
       (Explicitly, tacitly, historically, etc.)  Most important it cannot be unlatterally
       determined by raw strength.  To do so, has exactly the same negative abuse prone
       consequences that it has when individual social consequenes are assessed by the
       individual.  It quickly devolves into thuggery, where might makes right.



    5) 
       Given that a society is nothing but a group of individuals, consequences for a society
       amounts to some collective punitive actions.

       Now, many will be rightfully opposed to collective punitive actions.  After all
       this means that innocent individuals could be punished for actions taken by other
       individuals within their society.

    - Every individual should have the option to either accept or not accept responsibility
      for the actions of their group.



    National foreign policy consequences:

    (1)  A nation must not engage is punitive actions against other nation's citizens.
         To do so denys that nation's individual's right to freedom of government.  
         To do so inappropriately attempts to assign responsiblity for actions of that
         nations individuals.
         To do so voids the social contract just as direct relatiation violates the
         social contract between individuals.  It leads to thuggary.

    (2)  At the same time actions must have consequences, and a nation's failure to apply
         consequences to its actions, or the actions of individuals in those nations must  
         also have consequences.  

         As a nation one cannot unilaterally assess or apply these consquences, thus we must
         first work collectively to establish national contracts to protect our interests.
         Attempting to operate outside of these contracts is wrong, it leads to thuggery.


         Of course all all
