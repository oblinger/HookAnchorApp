# life.67\_Equilibrium\_Crash --


    I have been feeling quite good these days.
    Precipitiously this has shifted, and I want to understand it.


    The order:
    *    coming into AAAI, I felt good, questioning Elaine in balanced way, worried about TL program some.
    *    I told Paul Cohen to setup a meeting about TL, after doing this secrecy became an issue
         I started feeling like I had stuck my foot on the "third rail"
    TUE  My AAAI BL speech was a rousing success.
         That night I was very scared about my presentation, I felt dread.  Talked to elaine, rewrote slides, felt very? good
    WED  TL talk went well, felt good enough to take on project right then.
         BL group meeting rattled me.  Felt like I did not know how it was all going to fit together.
           WUNS:  woke up & could not sleep
    THR  Felt drained & scared.
         thinking about not being married.  Feeling like I should just? marry elaine.
           WUNS
    FRI  Missed news about program getting slashed.  Charlie says "where have you been!"
         Went out to asian aid event; felt lost
    SAT  Feeling better but realize my heart is heavy.
         I assure myself that it is not productive or healthy to allow shifts in perspective to immediately shift
         my job, my actions, etc.
         *IF* I decide that my life is not on a good path, then I will redirect it, over the next years, but
         not precipitiously.

    today is SATurday

    *******************
    **  THREE FEARS  **
    *******************
    (1)  I am contributing to a negative future for humanity, or at least I have lost the motivation for the work.
    (2)  I have missed the marriage boat, this is not going well.
    (3)  I don't want, and/or wont be effective at this program managment thing.


    LOSS OF DIRECTION
    I have been feeling important, and doing important things, but if they are not aiming in
    a positive direction then I have no direction for my life.  All the important things are 
    just meaningless things, or worse they are damaging things.
    QUESTION I MUST ANSWER:  Am I comfortable with the consequences of my work?
                          :  Is the specific technology I am working on going to have a positive or negative impact?
