# Terrorism --

    ------ 
    Assume that you are the victim of a significant unjust aggression. 
     
    Your RETALIATION will cause: 
    (1) FEAR in & DEATH of your enemy. Both will reduce the total amount of  
        future aggression against you. 
    (2) ANGER in your enemy that increases the total amount of future aggression. 
     
    Suppose in some particular case you believed that #2 was greater than #1. 
    That is, you believe the total amount of future aggression against you 
    in the long term would be HIGHER if you retaliate. 
     
    Would you still retaliate? 
     
    (A) DON'T retaliate, since I want to minimize loss. 
    (B) RETALIATE, since #2 can never be greater than #1 
    (C) RETALIATE, since it is impossible to estimate if #2>#1 
    (D) RETALIATE, since we must show backbone.  Not showing backbone will 
        cause many others to also attack us in future. 
    (E) RETALIATE, for some other reason. 
    (F) ATTACK, If *my* *future* fear and death was large enough 
        (In this case we don't care about the size of the past aggression) 
     
     
    Pick a letter now. 
     
     
    OK, now imagine explaining to Jacob, an Israeli, how to implement your advice. 
    Got it? 
     
    OK, now imagine explaining to Usef, a Palestinian terrorist, how to implement 
    your advice. 
     
    Got it?  Is this correct advice for Usef? 
    If not then what is different in the Palestinian case? 
    Will Usef believe the difference that you are claiming? 
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
    On each of the following statement 1-7 ask yourself do I believe that statement 
    ------ 
    GETTING JUSTICE:   Four properties of retaliation: 
    (1) MORE JUSTIFIED.  The one who retaliates believe in their justification 
        more than the recipient does. 
    (2) LESS DAMAGE.  The one who retaliates believe the damage caused 
        is less than the recipient does. 
    (3) ESCALATION.  If wrongly attacked, you have the right to retaliate 
        with greater force than the original attack. 
    (4) JUSTICE.  If wrongly attacked, you should retaliate even if 
        you cant win. 
         
     
    (The idea is that unless you retaliate with at least as much aggression 
     as was received you will only invite further aggression by showing  
     weakness.) 
     
    ------ 
    CYCLING:  What happens when aggression occurs between two adversaries  
    who both believe in this GETTING EVEN strategy: 
     
    (5) Each believes their aggression is  justified & the other's is not. 
          Even if one side admits they have hurt the other, they believe 
          it is not as bad as the other suggests (#2).  Even if the other 
          side admits there was some justification for the hurt, it was 
          not sufficient justification for the action (#1) 
     
    (6) Aggression MUST BE increased 
          Since each side knows that it has been unjustly attacked, it believes 
          it is justified is retaliating with increasing force. (by #3 above) 
          Indeed each believes is MUST do so, even if it means their own  
          destruction #4. 
     
    (7) POSSIBLE OUTCOMES 
        - One side eliminates the other side or its ability to attack. 
        - One or both sides stops believing in the getting even strategy. 
        - A third party forces them to stop. 
     
     
     
    Retaliation works: 
    - If Enemy's Ability to wage attacks is eliminated, or 
    - If retaliation makes those who remain more afraid rather than more angry. 
     
     
     
                            LOW   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   HIGH 
    Enemy Pride:            [their fear wins]            [their anger wins] 
    Enemy Strength:         [enemy eliminated]       [enemy not eliminated] 
    Enemy wealth to lose:   [their anger wins]            [their fear wins] 
     
     
    So retaliation works when enemy:  pride=low, strength=low, wealth=high 
     
    Palistinian->Israel   bad,bad,good 
    Israel->Palistinian   bad,good,bad 
    US->Afganistan        good,good,bad 
    BinLaudin->US         bad,bad,good
