    Ch 1.  Ch 2.8.3 (ROC)  Ch 9.3 (Bias-Varience) Tradeoff

    Bayes Risk?  Bayes Error?  Version Space?
    Data Preparation?   teach me BV-tradeoff.
    Regression vs classification?

    - Print out glossary

    There is another thing you could talk about: 
    the difference between classification and regression
    namely, the difference between learning how to produce class 
    labels and how to produce an estimate of the posterior of each class.
