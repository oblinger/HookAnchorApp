    Campus Relationship Manager Roles and Responsibilities
    As a reminder, your first job as a Campus Relationship Manager is to formulate a recruiting team for your school with the background <<>> skills that are matched to targeted departments <<>> areas at that school.  With this recruiting team, you need to do the following: 
    Build relationships with faculty and students with a focus on diversity, Ph.D. hiring, and building the RSM pipeline.
    Create a campus recruiting plan and report on this twice a year with the VP owner.   The campus plan should include at least two campus visits per year that include technical talks and visits with key faculty members
    Identify candidates early in their academic careers with a focus on URMs 
    Promote outstanding students by posting their records to the campus database and highlighting star candidates to HR. 
    Record your accomplishments as part of the PBC process.

    Ken, 
     
    Hello from the somewhat distant past!  This is the Dan that 
    worked with you and Dedre for about a year, on extensions to the 
    Structure Matching Engine. 
     Well I am now working 
    at IBM Watson Research, and have just been nominated as the  
    coordinator between Northwestern and IBM.  So perhaps I will 
    have a chance to say hello a bit more often. 
     
    This job is mostly about keeping tabs on strong upcoming students, so  
    IBM can hire them.  I also coordinate Summer Internships, Fellowships, 
    and Faculty Awards as well. 
     
    Anyway, I will be visiting Northwestern in the next month or so, and  
    would love to meet up, if you are available when I am in town.
