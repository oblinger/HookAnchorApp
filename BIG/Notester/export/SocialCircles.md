    Dear New Member,

    As Social Circles continues to grow, we constantly seek the best possible way to deliver service to all members. Moving forward, we are pleased to announce that effective immediately, all active members now have the ability to register online for events via the Social Circles website.

    All members will shortly be sent a secure login and password that will enable you to access the Members Only section of the Social Circles website at www.socialcircles.com and clicking on the link labeled Members.

    In addition to the ability to register for events 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, the new Members Only page will enable you to:

    Freeze or Unfreeze Your Membership
    Update Your Payment Information
    Update Personal Contact Information

    Please scroll down to note policy changes concerning event registration, weekend registration, waiting lists, and canceling registration for
    events:

    Activities Registration: Moving forward, the Activities E-mail will be solely used for member questions regarding events and for member feedback on events. This will allow the Activities Staff to devote more time to planning the highest quality events for all members.

    Weekend Registration: After 5:00pm on Fridays, if you wish to register for an event, you may do so via online registration online only. The weekend response line, extension 63, will no longer be checked for activity requests on the weekends.

    Cancelation Of Space For An Event: Please understand that under no circumstances will a member be credited a charge on their credit card on file with Social Circles should they cancel a space for a pre-paid CR or SR activity. However, if you do need to cancel a space for an event and do so within 48 hours of the event, you will receive an activity credit in the amount of the event. However, if you need to cancel a reservation for an event less than 48 hours prior to the commencement of the event (including the day of the event), you will not receive an activity credit. Social Circles incurs substantial expenses for prepaid events and cancelatiosn, particularly last minute cancelations, cause confusion for the staff, the group and the group leader of the event.

    Please keep this new cancelation procedure in mind prior to registering fo a pre-paid event. This cancelation policy does not apply to non CR and SR events.

    Waiting List Rule: Should you attempt to register for an event and all of the available spaces are full for that event, you have the option of being placed on a waiting list for the event. Waiting lists are rare, but we want all members to be aware of the fact that they can and do occur. When you register online, and if you opt to have your name placed on a waiting list for an event, the following will occur:

    (1) Your name will be placed on a list in the order in which we receive your request.

    (2) The waiting list will dissipate as members previously registered for the event cancel their space for an event and the activities staff will also endeavor to add as many spaces to the event to accomodate as many members as want to attend the event.

    (3) Under our new online registration, if you choose to be placed on the waiting list and a space subsequently becomes available, you will be AUTOMATICALLY registered for the event. For example, you attempt to register for Billiards on Sunday late on Friday afternoon and the event is full. You have two options. First, you may opt not be placed on the waiting list and you will not be able to attend the event. Option number two is to have your name placed on the waiting list. An opening could occur anytime between the time you attempted to register and the time of the event.

    If your name is on the waiting list and an opening becomes available, you will be registered for the event, your credit card will be charged for the cost of the event, and you will be e-mailed the itinerary. Please note how this differs from our past policy whereby we would contact members directly prior to placing them into an event if they were on a waiting list. Please take this new procedure into consideration when registering for an event for which there is a waiting list.

    Thanks for your time and attention to what isan exciting time for Social Circles. We look for ward to seeing you at some great events in thefuture.
