    Using blue pages as my guide, I have been wondering into random people's 
    offices who know about pervasive devices and then telling them about  
    our high-bandwidth-student-data-at-low-cost problem. 
     
    So far this has yielded two interesting directions.  The first one 
    is a device called the Bradio (after its creator Brad here in Watson). 
    This device is a transmitter (cost $12 in quantity), and a processor 
    with onboard EEroms (cost $4 in quantity).  There seems to be a variety 
    of auto-collectable data that can be had by giving each student one of these 
    gagets appropriately programmed and wired.  Plus this bradio has been used 
    for several years here in a number of ways, so there is some expertise  
    building on this platform.  I will talk more about this little critter 
    after I have thought about it alot more, and did some more talking to people. 
     
    A second interesting direction came out of a conversation with Herb Derby. 
    This approach is intended as only part of the total portfolio developed 
    for a given student, nonetheless it seems like it would facilitate  
    importation of a very large quantity of fairly diverse data on each student. 
    Better yet, it seems that appropriately configured it could save teacher  
    more time and hassle than it cost the teachers.  It is the combination of 
    high bandwidth and time saving that really has sparked my interest in the 
    approach. 
     
     
     
    SUMMARY 
     
    A single computer is placed in a central location in participating schools. 
    This system is equiped with:  
      (1) a large hard drive,  
      (2) a color scanner,  
      (3) an attached paper handler on scanner,  
      (4) a network connection, and  
      (5) a printer. 
     
    Teachers drop graded homework, in-class assigments, quizzes, and tests 
    onto this scanner, and their grades are automatically recorded and tabulated. 
    This scanning system facilitates scoring, tabulation, and recording of  
    completely structured texts where student answers and teacher marks occur 
    in predefined locations on each page.  At the other extreame the system 
    is able to record and tabulate annotations on completely unstructured  
    assignments, where no assumption can be made about the location or 
    number of annotation teacher marks, and no assumption can be made about  
    the structure or even number of pages in the student's work.  The only 
    requirement is that the work itself is recorded and graded on paper. 
    The tabulation of this scan can be immediately printed either per student 
    or for the entire class.  We encourage teachers to use some of the time 
    saved through automatic tabulation and recording of grages to provided  
    richer annotation of the assigments/tests.  We provide a single cheat-sheet  
    page of abbreviations for use by the teachers while grading. 
    These abbreviations allow them to annotate the work along a number of  
    dimensions.  All of the student work is indexed by these annotations so 
    when it is possible to instantly "drill down" into any online summary report  
    to see specific instances supporting a conclusion.  E.g. a student that makes 
    effective use of reference materials can be seen making such uses by simply 
    displaying appropiate bitmap images where the teacher wrote "~ref+" 
    Even if a teacher only places these abbreviations on a small 
    fraction of the graded work, it would still provide a wealth of rich  
    instantly available, detailed information at parent/teacher conferences, or 
    any other time when student work was being summarized. 
     
     
    FEATURES OF THE APPROACH 
     
    * TIME EFFICIENT 
      If careful attention is taken with the problem to address the student 
      assignment idenification, and the practical aspects of paper feeding, this 
      process can be less onerous that the current task of tabulating student 
      scores.  We can "spend" some of this time savings on richer teacher  
      annotations. 
     
    * RICH DATA 
      The greater the number of dimensions teachers use to evaluate student 
      work, the more sensitive those evaluations become to the inherent 
      subjectivity of those evaluations.  Maintaining a readily accessible link 
      to the original material being evaluated will minimize the impact of  
      these necessarily subjective measurements.  (The parent can exactly what 
      the teacher means by "trouble with paragraph construction, by quickly  
      viewing the twenty excerpts of the student's work where this annotation  
      was made.) 
     
    * INEXPENSIVE 
      Each school would only require a single computer equipt as described. 
      I belive this system could be configured for under $3000. 
     
    * SCALABLE 
      Both cost and training are minimal on this system.  I believe a ten 
      page manual and/or an hour's training would be sufficient to  
      use such a system (assuming we do a very good job on the user interface) 
     
    * FLEXIBLE 
      Can be used with any work that is recorded and graded on paper. 
      This includes a significant fraction of current student work, and  
      the majority of current student testing. 
     
    * MULTI-DIMENSIONAL 
      Assuming that each teacher occasionly utilizes the cheat-sheet of  
      abbreviations on one-out-of-ten questions they grade, this will yield 
      a significant stream of annotations on each student.  If the teacher 
      annotates the *questions* just once on each assignment then the simple 
      act of marking a problem right or wrong will provide a multi-dimensional 
      assessment of the student. 
     
    * HIGH-BANDWIDTH 
      Assuming a savings in tabulation time when using this system, and  
      assuming the existance of easily generated and standards-aligned  
      reports.  We can entice teachers to provide a single standards  
      alignment sheet for each assignment and test.   
      (See the section on framing for details) 
      The alignment sheet will enable the system to automatically translate 
      each the very minimal right or wrong marks on each problem into a 
      multi-dimension standards aligned evaluation.  This would provide 
      dozens of evaluations per student per class per week---literally  
      hundreds of thousands of evaluations for subsequent analysis without 
      costing the teachers more time than they currently spend on grading.

    =========================== 
     
     
    DATA STORAGE AND TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS 
     
    Archiving bitmaps for all pages of all student work in all sections of  
    all classes in a school sounds daunting.  Indeed this cost has made this 
    approach prohibitively expensive until quite recently.  Current technology, 
    however, makes such a comprehensively solution possible.  Consider the  
    following conservative analysis.  Assume: 
        5   classes semester per student 
       20   pages of work per student per class per week 
            ~ 100 pages per student per week. 
       30   students per class 
       33   classes simultaneous classes per school (15teacher@10classes per week) 
            ~ 100,000 pages per school per week 
       36   weeks of instruction per year 
            ~ 3,600,000 pages per school per year. 
      100K  per compressed bitmap image  (100,000 bytes) 
            ~ 360,000,000,000 = 360 Gig 
     
    A 360 Gig hard-drive is large but still quite affordable by today's standards. 
     
     
    Data transfer would also be manageble but would consistute a more significant 
    burden. If the school had 100-Megabit ethernet this would be sufficient to 
    allow many teacher to access the repository with under 1-second per  
    imaged page retrieved.  Both parents and teachers would be tempted to 
    access this information thru a much more ubiquitous 56K modem.  Such  
    a modem will require about 20 seconds to retrieve an image.  This is a painful 
    but bearable length of time to wait for an image assuming that a very small 
    number of images were to be retrieved. 
     
    One possible approach is to facilitate unattended downloading of student 
    data by each parent.  This would require about 30 minutes of connect time 
    per parent week.  Sophisticated compression could yield downloading times 
    that would approach several seconds, but these would require client side 
    decompression software.  The 100K per image is assuming .pdf format which  
    can be readily viewed on most browsers.  Finally, intelligent clipping 
    might allow parents to view relevant parts of the work interactively 
    minimizing delays by transmitting only portions of a page at a time. 
    By the end of the year each parent would have 3.6 Gig of disk space  
    utilized by their childs work.  Most consumer computers could handle 
    this with minimal difficulty. 
     
    Assuming the same numbers above we see that each teacher would accumulate 
    less than 30*10*20 = 6,000 pages of material per week, or 600Meg of data. 
    All data since the last parent teacher conference could be loaded by 
    USB cable in a matter of minutes prior to each parent teacher conference. 
     
    All of these numbers are quite conservative, and represent extensive use 
    of this system.  Lighter use will coorespondingly represent lighter loads 
    on each component. 
     
     
     
    STUDENT/TEACHER TIME/EFFORT BURDEN 
     
    This proposal has the advantange that collects high-volumes of 
    evaluated student data on a frequent basis (dozens of evalutions per 
    student per week per class.)  This high-bandwidth can also be the 
    downfall of the approach.  The more frequent/ubiquitous an activity 
    the more disasterous is any associated inconvenience.  This proposal 
    requires daily interaction with participating teachers.  Thus even the 
    smallest burdens will preclude the regular use of the approach.  We 
    believe careful attention to this aspect of the system is by far the 
    most important hurdle to widespread adoption.  Thus we will consider 
    this aspect in some detail. 
     
    Each block of student material is entered into the system using the  
    following basic process: 
    - Student's complete the work and index the work. 
      (Indexing specifies which student which class and which assignment. 
       See indexing considerations.) 
    - The teacher grades and annotates the student work 
    - The teacher annotates a blank alignment sheet for the assignement or test. 
      (See framing and alignment.) 
    - The pages are scanned.  (See scanning) 
    - The resolution step allows the system to query the teacher about ambigous  
      annotations, and allows the teacher to correct mistakes is tabulation. 
      (See resolution) 
    - Finally reports and interactive analysis is performed asynchronously, by 
      teachers, administrators, parents, and students. 
     
    Since the alignment, scanning, and resolution steps are not required by 
    traditonal grading we strive to make these activities less burdensome than 
    the tabulation and recording step eliminated by this approach. 
    Every teacher will want to use this approach if it is easy to learn and 
    if it takes less time to use it rather than not use it. 
     
     
    INDEXING 
    Quite simply, indexing is the process of annotating each page of each  
    student's work so that we the following can be determined automatically 
    and with very high reliablity: 
    - Student name. 
    - Class, section, and teacher. 
    - The assignment, and the page number within the assignment. 
     
    It is possible that we would use OCR and allow each student to simply write 
    this information on each sheet.  The reliability of this approach would  
    not be 100%, and would thus require intervention by the teacher to  
    resolve these indexing failures.   
     
    A second approach would be to supply each student with a reel of stickers 
    for each class.  Each sticker would contain their name and a picture 
    that denotes the class (e.g. a quarter note for music, or 1+1 for math.) 
    The stickers would each have a unique number starting at 1, as well 
    as a 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter 2-D bar code containing the same 
    information.  Students are given the a reel of stickers for each class 
    at the beginning of the year, and place them on their assignments. 
     
    Teacher's also have a reel of stickers to annotate the alignment sheet 
    with the number of the assignment being scanned.  Student work 
    scanned in the same batch as an alignment sheet is assumed to be 
    part of the same assignment.  If student work is scanned out of seqence 
    (e.g. turned in late) then the teacher's assignment stickers can be used 
    to annotate which assignment is being scanned. 
     
    Both the order of scanning and the sticker index numbers are simultaneously 
    used to determine the page numbering within a given assignment.  Accurate 
    ordering is critical for the rigid and ordered framing alignements  
    (see the framing and alignment section).  Using both allows teachers to 
    resolve instances where the student inadvertently turned in their assignments 
    out of order, the pages were dropped or shuffled, or the students 
    placed the stickers on their papers out of order. 
     
    The goal of indexing is to provide a global address for each page of student 
    work across an entire school and an entire year.  Having a global address 
    for each page facilitates robust and *unattended* scanning of the student  
    work.  Pages can be dropped shuffled mixed with other classes.  They may  
    be partially scanned and then rescanned in a different order, after a  
    jam in the scanner's paper handling is fixed.

    ANNOTATION IN ACTION 
     
    For example, in Alice's report on the French-Indian war 
    she launches into a discussion of the impact that it had on the  
    textile industry of the time.  Her teacher is impressed that this demonstrates 
    good use of reference material, since this topic was not covered in her 
    text book.  At the same time, its introducion into the report leave the 
    overall organization of the report in disarray.  Alice's frequent tangents 
    often yield this kind of poor organzaition.  Her teacher annotates this 
    by writing:   
      ~ref+  org-  pt  focus 
      interesting topic but it is not introduced properly 
     
    If Alice's teacher chooses to print out a summary per student, then  
    a short explanation of each of the annotations will be provided for Alice.
