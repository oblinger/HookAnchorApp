    Arguments about control at the atom level ... 
     
     
    Why not build a 3D ribosome? 
    - Artifacts are composed of a regular (cubic or tetrihedral) 
      arrangement of "blocks" 
    - Each "block" is an arrangement of atoms with a fixed size and  
      binding sites (six for a cubic structure, four for tetrihedral). 
      Blocks are analogous to amino acids in a biological system, but 
      the are chemically fused in all three dimensions by the 3D ribosome, 
      unlike a biological system. 
    - A "tape" is a linear sequence of instruction.  Each  
      instruction is a group of atoms that specifies some action for the 
      3D ribosome.  The tape is analgous to mRNA in a biological system. 
    - The 3D-ribosome chemically fuses blocks linearly according to  
      the instructions on its tape. 
    - This line of blocks are wound onto a torus (or other 3D shape) 
    - Like their biological counterparts tape instructions form 
      complementary pairs and can thus be duplicated by enzymiatic process. 
    - Both the tape duplication and fusing of blocks are performed 
      by enzymes made from blocks.   
    - Constitutent components (blocks and instructions) are created  
      through traditional chemical processes.
