# 999idea.Associator --

    The associator save and retrieves patterns. 
     
     
    FEED FORWARD ACTIVATION 
    - Patterns trip other patterns 
    - Detect surprising connections 
    - FO structure recognized and collapsed into non-FO pattern nodes. 
     
     
     
    RETRIEVAL METHODS 
    - Direct retrieval of tokens, patterns, and threads 
    - Retrieval of similar elements to a target 
    - Retrieval of containing elements from fragments of elements. 
     
     
    ASSOCIATION 
    - Creation of new tokens to represent the 
     
     
    TOKEN 
    - A TOKEN is a newly created symbol token. 
    - The symbol is "defined" by a vector of activated "children" tokens. 
    - It is the basic building block for patterns stored in the associator. 
     
     
    PATTERN 
    - A pattern is a gensym defines an observed or imagined pattern among a 
      set of tokens. 
    - For example "Dan bought the book" could be captured as: 
      D="Dan", B="Book", P="Purchase", P1="Purchaser", P2="Purchasee", 
      DP=<<>>, BP=<<>>, PATTERN=DPB=<<>> 
     
    THREAD 
    - A sequence of patterns.
