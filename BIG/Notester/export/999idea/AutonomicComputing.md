    Build Scaffold model of graphs representing computing systems, 
    and code algorithms for diagnosis and recovery over general graphs. 
     
    Have the system *learn* the many instantiations of this model. 
     
     
     
    (1) Hard code 
        - Instrumentation for system inspection 
        - Instrumentation for operator monitoring 
        - Instrumentation for action exeuction (optional) 
     
    (2) Write 
        - Simple graph model of computing system 
          (specific system would be a complex expansion/instantiation of this 
           simple graph) 
        - General algorihms for diagnosis; inspection and repair 
          over these graphs. 
     
    (3) K-Acquistion system fills in details in scaffolding 
        - Restricted learning of expectations and detectiong 
          of triggers from watching system and operator. 
        - Active leraning of PK. 
        - Learning from text????

    So you learn: 
    - TCP/IP drivers for Win2000 is a communication layer. 
    - They run only when the hardware port is working and connected.
