    BALANCED PRIVACY 
     
    >>> A TAXONOMY OF KNOWING AND ACTION 
    - Illegal to be known 
    - Legal to be known/Legal to hide 
    -  
    - Authorization to know something 
    - Authorization to use knoweldge for some purpose 
      - Restriction by  
    - PURPOSES 
      - Actions relating to a person initiated event. 
        - Actions regarding a specific transaction 
      - Ongoing maintainance  
      - Unsolicited actions 
     
    >>> ONE GOAL: PERSONAL CONTROL 
    - Privacy is not really the end goal 
    - Personal control is the underly goal 
    - Like all goals this one does not exist in a vacuum, others impt. 
      Thus we want to balance these sometimes conflicting goals. 
    - Control by not allowing others not to know something 
      is a very blunt (but strong) method of control. 
    - New tech is going to give us us new intermediate points on this spectrum 
      Sometimes the intermediate will make better tradeoffs 
     
    >>> SEPERATE KNOWLEDGE OF AND ACTION ON 
    - Just because I have your phone number does not mean that I 
      should be allowed to call it. 
    - Important because it gives us greater flexibilty in making  
      our tradeoff 
     
     
    >>> MY GOALS  
    - betterment of the human condition. 
    - Advances and losses taken from the perspective on the  
      individual. 
    - BUT I do not necessarily assume current popular belief regarding 
      privacy, will or should remain fixed. 
    - I believe that popular option very roughly approximates the  
      pros and cons of in a pragmatic evaluation. 
     
    >>> SUPPORT OF A PRAGMATIC APPROACH 
    - New technology do not what could be accomplished "in principle" 
    today.  (Hiring a army of full time spys.) 
     
    The danger with new tech, is that it makes many types of breaches of  
    privacy practical, on a pervasive day-to-day basis. 
     
    Thus when analyzing the consqences of any particular policy we should 
    give most weight to what we estimate as likely to occur rather than 
    what in most extreme conditions could happen. 
     
    (Worse case senerios are still relevant, but we should clearly seperate 
    and consider likely vs. possible consequences.)
