    ### MASS PRODUCE THE CELLS 
    - Make the basic cell 
    - Create cell types through in n seperated batches.  Each batch has 
      a specific zipper and functional attachments 
     
    ### ZIPPER 
     
    ### CLEAN AND COAT 
    - Remove zipper attachements 
    - Attach specialized functional attachemnts 
     
    ### CLUMP 
    - Activate clumping sites 
     
     
    - Clumping 
    - Diffusion sort 
    - Disolve 
     
    Scavenging 
    - Randomized scavenger 
    - Crevice scavenger
