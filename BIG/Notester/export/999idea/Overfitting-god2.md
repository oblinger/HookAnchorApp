# 999idea.Overfitting-god2 --

    Mark, 
     
    Several months ago you tried to codify my half-baked over fitting 
    argument about the existence of god.  This has motivated me to think 
    about the whole thing in classic Dan style--obsessive detail.  Still I 
    am rather happy with the outcome.  It took me the better part of two 
    days to put it into writing.  If I had the energy, I would reread it 
    and shorten it, but I don't so you will have to suffer.  Now if I can 
    only somehow patent this whole thing for IBM, I will be able to count 
    the effort as work!  ;-> 
     
    For some reason I thought it would be fun to send this on to your Dad, 
    and Sister as well.  I hope you (and they) don't mind.  -Dan

    PREAMBLE 
    For this discussion, we define "Science," as the empirical process of 
    observing the world, and then attempting to build generative 
    (predictive) theory of the world that is parsimonious and consistent 
    with those observations.  For this discussion we define "God" as the 
    non-religion specific, generic, regular old, "I am who am," God. 
    "Ultimate Truth" is the definitive, complete model of both all the 
    observable and unobservable aspects of the world. 
     
     
    THE TWO PERSPECTIVES 
    Alice believes in God, she interprets the world using this 
    perspective.  Bob believes in Science, he interprets the world using 
    this perspective.  Bob believes that his position is empirically 
    justified, and that Alice's position is not.  At a recent cocktail 
    party Alice and Bob both explained their positions.  With only the 
    slightest provocation Bob was the first to launch into his rather 
    lengthy treatise. 
     
     
    BOB'S SCIENCE MANIFESTO  
    In the beginning man knew facts F1, and built a theory T1 to explain 
    those facts.  Man gazed upon T1 and saw it was good-- it was 
    parsimonious and predictive of all facts F1 plus newly observed facts 
    F1'.  In man's second age new Facts, F2, came to light, and T1 did not 
    imply F2, man with infinite wisdom created T2 such that T1 implied F2 
    (F2 contains F1). Again man was pleased.  Down through the ages man's 
    ingenuity was always superior to his ability to perceive.  A Ti that 
    implied Fi soon followed each Fi. 
     
    At each step man started with the ASSUMPTION that Science would 
    suffice. He reasoned that in each previous age a parsimonious theory 
    had been found that predicted (most) of what was relevant, and that 
    this theory did not involve any reference to God.  Why should this 
    iteration be different? 
     
    And indeed is was found *not* to be different.  His intellect was, 
    time after time, up to the task.  He no longer believed in the exact 
    theory Ti that was the current theory of his time.  He would say that 
    is was only an approximation.  Instead he believed it was the best 
    that we knew today, and that we were homing in by successive 
    approximation on Ultimate Truth.  And man was pleased. 
     
    Modern man gazed back in time at the sequence of theories Ti, and saw 
    that it was good.  With growing confidence, he declared that not all 
    could be known, but that more and more assertions about the universe 
    could be known with greater and greater certainty. 
     
    When confronted with question about the very nature of the universe, 
    he would look back at the sequence of theories and see if a single 
    consistent conclusion could be drawn by all theories after a certain 
    point in the past (some theory Ti).  If so he would say, "one can 
    never know with absolute certainty but the overwhelming empirical 
    evidence demonstrates..." 
     
    One the subject of "God," man had a clear answer. We have incredible 
    empirical evidence behind a series of Ti, all of which are consistent 
    with the world, and none of which require (or even leave room for) 
    God.  He doesn't know it for a fact, but he has overwhelming empirical 
    evidence. "God does not exist." 
     
     
    ALICE'S STATEMENT OF FAITH  
    Alice by contrast is much less assertive about the objective 
    justifiability of her position.  She admits that her beliefs are 
    derived from her *feeling* that there is a God--her belief is based on 
    faith. 
     
    Her interpretation of the universe starts by assuming that this 
    feeling about God is correct, and she tries to understand the world 
    from this perspective.  She accepts that her position is one based on 
    Faith, but she argues that one must understand the world based on the 
    information available, and she, unlike Bob, does not preclude 
    subjective facts (feelings) as a possible basis for her understanding 
    of the universe. 
     
      
    THE DUST IN ALICE'S EYE  
    It's hard to say what most people thought at the party, but I must 
    admit that I was convinced.  Yes, as Bob suggests, he cannot *prove* 
    that Alice is wrong, he can only point to a mountain of evidence, and 
    say "well it *could* be a coincidence, but what a HUGE coincidence 
    that would have to be." 
     
    Just as the party was about to turn to lighter topics, a rather 
    shadowy guest who has said nothing up to this point, suggests that we 
    might shed further light on these positions, by considering two 
    similar individuals in a simpler imagined universe.  One that we have 
    total access to since we will have created it. 
     
    For simplicity this is a universe without a god, indeed this universe 
    is nothing more than a truncated pixilated version of the Cartesian 
    plane.  Each pixel can either be on or off, and the state of these 
    pixels is the only thing that creatures of this world can perceive 
    (essentially this universe is a black and white computer monitor).  In 
    the first age of this world, Al and Bo two of its in habitants are 
    able to "see" 1000 pixels of resolution along each dimension.  Even at 
    that, their sight is noisy, and so they have confusion about the exact 
    nature of the universe.  Nonetheless Bo ambitiously sets out to 
    understand the universe; she attempts to find the simplest set of line 
    segments that describes which pixels are on.  After much work she 
    succeeds in generating a piecewise linear theory, T1, that describes 
    all known facts, F1 (known on/off pixels). 
     
    In a second age, both Al and Bo are able to see more, each of the 
    original pixels are divided into a 10 by 10 array of more refined 
    pixels.  Again Bo generates a piecewise linear model, T2, of this 
    10000x10000 universe.  Al begins to feel that the universe has 
    curvature, and that her adherence to piecewise linear models is 
    unfounded.  Through successive ages, Bo succeeds in describing all 
    that is known, as a piecewise linear model, she is never forced to 
    consider the less constrained space of possible non-linear models. 
     
    Bo's confidence in linearity as an ultimate truth about the universe 
    grows over time.  Bo knows that Al could be right, the universe could 
    have curvature.  It could all be curves, but the overwhelming 
    empirical evidence is that it does not.  None of her theories have 
    curves--she has never needed to resort to adding such unconstrained 
    (ugly) things to her beautiful interpretation of the universe. 
     
    When Al whines about Bo's model of the universe, she explains that the 
    space of all possible non-linear models is far too large for her to 
    contemplate.  Even if Al found a theory out there, she would have 
    little reason to believe it; it is simply not parsimonious to consider 
    theories with curves when a predictive linear theories exist. 
     
    Except this is *our* universe, and here we choose ultimate truth, and 
    in this universe, we have chosen the perfect circle as the shape that 
    underlies the successively refined pixelations.  Unlike each of Bo's 
    theories this universe *IS* curved.  Al is right! 
     
    What went wrong with Bo's thinking?  Is this simply the extremely 
    unlikely case of overwhelming empirical evidence being coincidentally 
    wrong?  No.  Even if we continued the experiment, she would have keep 
    finding consistent piecewise linear models; those are the models she 
    is seeking. 
     
    It seems that she was not using the Scientific method correctly since 
    we now see that her belief in a linear model could never be refuted by 
    any set of observations regardless of how refined they were.  Bo 
    stridently refuses to concede on this point, however.  She says she 
    has employed science correctly, each of her theories Ti did make 
    specific predications that could be refuted by observation.  Indeed as 
    resolution increased, these theories *were* overthrown by new 
    observations.  Bo knows her science. 
     
    We see from the outside that Bo's failure occurred before she 
    began. She failed when she first thought to express the world as a 
    piecewise linear model.  She had no right to believe that that would 
    work.  And when it *did* work, and work, and work again, she became 
    arrogant. She believed her successes justified or at least supported 
    her very first assumption.  "How could it be otherwise?"  she would 
    say, "The empirical evidence is overwhelming." 
     
    Except it WAS otherwise. 
     
     
    BACK AT THE PARTY 
    The intended conclusions for our world were clear.  The stranger had 
    mislead us, we weren't speaking of the speck in Alice's eye, but 
    rather the plank wedged in our own eyes, the plank in Bob's eye.  Our 
    belief in Science also *only* stems from faith, but we have been 
    deluding ourselves, and smugly proclaiming it was somehow justified by 
    its consistency with our world. 
     
    But can this be right?!?  After all these millennia of observation do 
    we have absolutely NO evidence that we can legitimately place as an 
    offering at the altar of Science?  Even though Bo was wrong, didn't 
    her many successes give her some small amount of support for her 
    piecewise linear models of the world?  No it really didn't, after all 
    no matter how the pixels are arranged, there is always *some* 
    piecewise linear model consistent with them, so the fact that she 
    found a consistent one time after time is really no evidence at all. 
    By analogy, given *any* finite snapshot of the observable universe F1, 
    there is always a smallest theory T1 that does not resort to 
    introducing a god, and still explains F1.  Thus our repeated success 
    in finding such theories is really no evidence at all that we are 
    homing in on anything. 
     
    But can this be right?  After all the successive theories, Ti, which 
    we have found are not just axioms consistent with some set of random 
    facts.  The theories we have found are *much* more concise than one 
    would expect if the facts that we were describing did not themselves 
    originate from some small theory.  Seeing this Bob thought to save his 
    position by adjusting his support of Science in the follow way: It is 
    not the fact that a theory Ti is found, but rather the conciseness of 
    this theory relative to the world it explains, Fi.  Surely this could 
    not happen by accident!  Even if ultimate truth cannot be expressed 
    using the language of our succession of theories, these theories must 
    be on the right track, otherwise there would be chaos, the theories Ti 
    would be little more concise that the mass of facts they explain, Fi. 
     
    The stranger conceded some ground on this point only to take it back 
    again: Perhaps you are right, *something* about mankind's theories 
    might overlap some aspect of ultimate truth as evidenced by the 
    unexpected conciseness mankind has achieved in explaining this 
    universe.  This is difficult to evaluate, since man tends to ignore 
    the parts of Fi that he cannot currently explain.  Notice, however, 
    that even Bo can rest easy in her 2D twilight hours knowing that her 
    theory is also much more concise than she would expect from a randomly 
    pixilated world.  Surely her model also captures some aspect of 
    ultimate truth.  In fact it does.  Both line segments and circles have 
    a high degree of local continuity.  In both models "On" pixels are "in 
    line with" other "on" pixels, thus world created from circles is 
    unexpected easy to describe using line segments.  Still what leverage 
    does this afford Bo in answering questions about her universe?  Well 
    if she wants to predict the value for a particular pixel, she would be 
    justified in using her theory since her theory has been empirically 
    justified on many other such pixel observations. 
     
    After conceding this point, however, the stranger asked the rhetorical 
    question: Can Bo use her theory to answer questions that are not in 
    principle observable?  No she cannot.  While her model of the world 
    may provide an answer to deeper questions about her universe, it has 
    not been empirically tested on those questions, it *cannot* be tested 
    on those questions since they are not in principle observable.  Her 
    models of her world leave no room for curvature, yet her evidence for 
    her world model should *NOT* be seen as evidence supporting the 
    absence of curvature.  Another theory could (does) exist that is 
    consistent with her observable world which also includes curvature. 
    All of her mountains of empirical evidence provide no support that 
    curvature does not exist, and you Bob have absolutely no shred of 
    evidence whatsoever that God does not exist. 
     
    Well Bob's uncomfortable slide from firm empiric grounding is obvious 
    in his face, even Alice is a bit moved by his unexpected loss of 
    footing.  Still Bob is tenacious.  He declares that the analogy with 
    Bo is interesting but fallacious.  After all, Bo should have seen that 
    a circular model of her pixilated world was the most parsimonious 
    model of all.  If she had been a true Scientist she would have found 
    ultimate truth. 
     
    Of course this is true, said the stranger.  But you are simply saying 
    that if she had known the language (circles) best used to express 
    ultimate truth, she would have found ultimate truth.  But what right 
    does she have to believe that she has in fact found the right language 
    to express ultimate truth?  She has no such right, and neither do we! 
    Indeed what a coincidence it would be that the created would find the 
    words of the creator.  Not only do we not have the right to make such 
    a huberious assertion, indeed if we are fair in our assessment, we 
    must to admit that any paltry form of expression we have managed to 
    find probably has no particular bearing on ultimate truth.  What 
    should compel us to believe otherwise?  No empiric justification can 
    do this. 
     
     
    AWAKE IN BED AGAIN 
    That night, I thought about all that had been said.  It seems true, 
    God is not dead, Science is dead.  Sure Science can predict ground 
    observable assertions about our world, but nothing more.  But even if 
    Science *is* dead that does imply that God lives.  Now we know 
    *nothing*--can we never do any better?  Questions about the nature of 
    this world persist, just as surely as Bo and Al's questions follow 
    them.  What purchase can we find for battles in this arena?  Clearly 
    if such footing is to be found it cannot come from the observable 
    world. 
     
    Where then?  As soon as the question is asked, the answer is 
    clear. The only other possible source is our *feelings* about which 
    perspective is the right perspective.  The only way we could ever 
    possible know the language of ultimate truth is if God simply gave it 
    to us.  We would have to simply know it from the beginning.  This is 
    the only possible way.  Even as I accept the inevitability of this 
    answer, I am disconcerted by it.  How can we know that these feeling 
    about our world contain any true insight into that world?  Of course 
    we can never know that, the best we can do is to accept them as 
    another source of input of untestable value in understanding the world 
    in which we live. 
     
    In the end we see that both Bob and Alice have faith.  Experience 
    cannot be used to justify his belief in science, yet he still 
    believes--he has *faith* in Science.  Ironically Alice's acceptance of 
    God based on her subjective sense that God exists is a more internally 
    consistent (rational) position, than Bob's internally inconsistent 
    (irrational) position that his belief in Science is an empirically 
    justified belief. 
     
    Alice was right.  The *only* honest way to proceed is to first pick a 
    perspective that feels appropriate, and then to interpret the world 
    from within this perspective. 
     
    So what do I feel? 
     
     
     
    <<>> 
     
    Well bob...  i mean mark, explain your ass out of this one to 
    alice... i mean carolyn!!  ;-> 
     
    Seriously, I have never really thought this through in such detail 
    before, so I don't quite know if I even buy any of this.  I have to 
    thank you for prompting me to think it through so carefully!  Wouldn't 
    it be cosmic irony if you, my atheistic friend, were responsible for 
    increasing my rather lame ass faith!  Remember there is definitely 
    more Bob than Alice in me too. 
     
    Your manager invited me out to dinner with you and Carolyn this Thursday. 
     
     
    Cheers, 
    Dan
