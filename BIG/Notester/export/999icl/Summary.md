# 999icl.Summary -- Brief description of the basic icl concept

    SUMMARY 
     
     <<>>       The glue between software components is the problem; a 
                       new paradigm for combining software components is the 
                       solution. 
     <<>>       Properties of envs that form the basis of the approach. 
     <<>>         Types of benefits afforded by the approach. 
     <<>>         Specific circumstances where ICL has benefit. 
     <<>>       Alternate instantiations of the basic approach.

    CONFIGURATION OBJECT -- all info 
     
    INSTALLATION OBJECT -- An installation object is a read-only object 
    (possibly a collection of objects) 
     
    INSTALLATION -- Represents a single installation of a software package. 
    It is composed of a configuration object, and
