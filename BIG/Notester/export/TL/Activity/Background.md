    Dan,

    By way of background...

    The MIT-Singapore Alliance has been focused on educational goals, with some shared research involved in the education of PhDs; that's the program that Leslie and I have been involved with.  There is a separate "relationship" between DSO (part of defense research in
    Singapore) and our laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT.  I believe we've met Dr. How in that context, although neither Leslie or I are actively involved in that program.  As part of that, DSO has sent a couple of their people to spend a year at MIT, in exchange for some research funds.  One of these people spent the year with Regina Barzilay (she works on statistical natural language processing and has done work on transfer learning in that domain).  From what we've heard, these projects have gone very well and the Singaporeans are interested in continuing/extending this interaction with CSAIL.

    We don't have any language work going on directly in the Transfer project; so there is synergy at the fundamental algorithm level but not directly at the applications level.  We've had a workshop at MIT on Transfer Learning and Regina participated, so she is well aware of the activity in this area.  And, as DanO mentioned, she's a couple doors away from Tommi Jaakkola, Leslie and me, as is Mike Collins, the other person at MIT working at the intersection of machine learning and language processing.

    Just so you know,
    Tomas
