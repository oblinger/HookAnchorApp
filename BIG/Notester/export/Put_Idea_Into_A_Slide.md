# Put\_Idea\_Into\_A\_Slide --

    Not to put you off  too much, but I am now being hit with multiple new ideas every week, and mathematically the hours in the days do not allow me to keep up.  I have instituted the following discipline to help me focus on getting the right ideas to the right places, and to better prepare myself if I am going to go to my office director asking for funds.  Unfortunately, this puts more work on you upfront to build a slide, before we even know if the idea has legs, and I apologize for that.  Still the work is pretty limited, and as you know, being able to boil an idea down to its essence is a really useful way to get it in a form that can be used to "shop it around."

    Once we have the slide described below we can use it to decide if it falls in my area of expertise and interest.  If so, I will use it when briefing the office director (after we talk).  If not, then it is still in the optimal format for me to use in trying to determine if another PM or the office director might be interested. 


     

    Cheers,
