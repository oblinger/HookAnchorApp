    A couple of people I talked to on our retreat weekend asked if they could join in on a ski weekend that I am planning.
    So I have decided to just send out an invitation to everybody on the Retreat.  I apologize in advance, if I simply
    run out of places at the house I am renting.  I would love to bring everyone, but the house has only so many beds,
    so first come first serve!  If you are interested in skiing Feb 3rd thru Feb 6th please read on...

    ---
    The basic plan is to travel by car (rented if needed) to Sugarbush vermont on Thursday Feb 3rd.
    We ski Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and return sunday evening.  It is about a 5.5 hour ride.
    Friday and saturday nites we designate a few good cooks to prepare a dinner (the kitchen is very well
    furnished) add some wine and we have a feast.

    The cost (assuming we fill all 12 spots) is a nightly rate of about $65-$110 per person.
    Some rooms are much nicer, have queen size beds that sleep two plus a jacuzzi, others are more modest with
    bunk twin beds.  In the past even the most lavish dinners plus breakfast food came out to 
    about $15-20 a day.  Each person will handle their own ski rental and lift tickets  (see <<>>) 
    If we dont have enough cars, people can split car rentals as well.

    The house we will stay in is really nice, it has an indoor lap pool, very large dining area, with double
    sided fireplace.  All of the furniture is beautiful.  There are a couple of jacuzzis and a sauna.
    Really nice to relax and feast as a group after beating yourself up on the slopes.

    So you get the idea.  Let me know if you are interested.

    Blessings,
    Dan








    A show of hands for Skiing

    Continuing our annual tradition it is time for another ski weekend!
    We have contacted the owner of that great place we stayed at last year.
    The good news is that we can rent it again this year for the same rate.
    This will mean a nightly rate of about $60 - $100 per person assuming we
    get 12 people.

    I am thinking about going up Thursday Feb 3rd. and returning Sunday Feb 6th.
    This will give us three days of skiing and two nights of eating.

    Drop me a note if you want to join in.  First come first serve, so 
    let me know ASAP.

    Cheers, 
    Dan

    P.S. We also have availability in the first week of March, if too many
    cannot make the Feb date.



    Also, let's say that 12 is our absolute max.  That will mean that two people will be in the sleeping loft (which is in one of the master bedrooms so 4 people will have to share that room) and 2 people will be in the reading loft area (on the second floor) on an aerobed.  
     
    Assuming we have 12, let's say we break up the prices per night as following:
     
    Private room with Queen: $110 per person, per night (assuming 2 people in this room)
    Private room with Queen: $110 per person, per night (assumning 2 people in this room) 
    Private room with Queen and 2 in sleeping loft on aerobed: 
        --those in the Queen -- $85 per person, per night (assuming 2 people)
        --those on an aerobed in the sleeping loft -- $60 per person, per night (assuming 2 people)
    Private room with twin bunks:  $75 per person, per night (assuming 2 people in this room)
    Reading loft on aerobed: $60 per person, per night (assuming 2 people)

    =====================================================
    So here is an update on our fast approaching ski trip.  First here is who is going:

    Minjoo & David
    Sueanne & John
    Nick & Jane
    Richard & Jane
    Dan, Martin, Tom


    Minjoo and I were talking about how we might get everybody upto the slopes.
    I have tenatively grouped people by cars below, I know that when people are
    going is still up in the air so there may be an extra car.

    I think Car 1 and Car 2 are pretty much set, but car 3 might be split if
    people go at different times, also we don't yet have a spot for Tom.

    Ok, so here is the latest update.  I have the cars listed as best I understand them.
    I have a first pass on the sleeping below.  We may be able to split the

    along with 2 granola type bars per person per day for the slopes.
    If there are other must have breakfast items let me know.

    THE PLACE   ( It is so sweet, have a look:  <<>> )




    DIRECTIONS
    Here are the directions from NYC.
    Merritt Parkway to 91 N
    91N to 89N
    89N to exit 3 in VT. Bethel
    Follow Rt 107 South through Bethel and towards
    Stockbridge, VT
    Take a right onto RT 100 North
    Follow RT 100 N into Warren.
    When you see the sign for Warren Village, don't take
    it. Stay on RT 100 until you see the sign for Lincoln
    Gap Road. Take that left, it's across from Warren
    Village's 2nd entrance.
    1 mile up lincoln Gap and then a left on Lincoln Brook
    Road. This is a private road down hill in LOW gear.
    Non 4 wheel cars should be left at the top plowed
    pull-out. Cross the bridge and count houses. Don't
    count the barn. We are the 4th house on this road and
    the driveway goes straight into our house as the road
    bear left up the last steep hill to another house. The
    key to this road is low gear down and fast up without
    spinning your wheels. 

    The key is on a nail, knee high on the outside
    lefthand side of the  front door frame. It opens the
    front and inside mudroom door. Please leave all shoes
    in the mudroom so you can walk around inside without
    having melting snow on the hardwood floors.

       mmsI used: "Lincoln Gap and Lincoln Brook" and "Warren Vermont"  as the destination address

    ================
    -Dan, there is nothing off the highway once you hit 89
    to get something to eat. Your best bet is to take 89
    South instead of North for 1 exit into West Lebanon,
    N.H. There you'll find a Chilly's, and every flavor of
    fast food. It's only backtracking a mile or two.

    Then get back on 89 North and your about 1:10 mins.
    from West Leb. to the house. House number is
    802-496-3167. I'm actually in Boston and it's best to
    call me on my cell if you need anything at all.
    609-636-8234 

    I have infrastructure up in VT to handle most things.
    Let me know and I'll be the point person. Mailed
    Minjoo a information package overnight today. 
    ================

    Bring something for the water.... we have a lap pool, sauna, and steam, lets use them!
