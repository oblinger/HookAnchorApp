    HABIT 1: BE PROACTIVE 
            1. For a full day, listen to your language and to the language of the people around you. How often 
               do you use and hear reactive phrases such as "If only," "I can't," or "I have to"?
        2. Identify an experience you might encounter in the near future where, based on past experience, 
               you would probably behave reactively. Review the situation in the context of your Circle of Influence. 
               How could you respons proactively? Take several moments and create the experience vividly in your mind, 
               picturing yourself responding in a proactive manner. Remind yourself of the gap between stimulus and response. 
               Make a commitment to yourself to exercise your freedom to choose.
        3. Select a problem from your work or personal life that is frustrating to you. Determine whether it 
               is a direct, indirect, or no control problem. Identify the first step you can take in your Circle 
               of Influence to solve it and then take that step.
        4. Try the thirty-day test of proactivity. Be aware of the change in your Circle of Influence.
