    Dr. Oblinger is focused on adaptive systems that build upon prior experience. This includes methods for bootstrapping concepts from prior learned knowledge and approaches to complexity reduction using adaptive algorithms that employ richer knowledge structures than those used in Machine Learning today.

    Building on over 15 years of Artificial Intelligence experience, Dr. Oblinger was previously affiliated with the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (IACS) until 2005. Prior to his university position, he was a staff researcher at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York. At IBM, Dr. Oblinger co-initiated an ongoing effort to invent technologies that can be reprogrammed in the field by novice users who simply demonstrate desired behaviors.

    Dr. Oblinger holds a B.S. in mathematics and computer science from Northern Kentucky University, a M.S. in computer science from the Ohio State University, and a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Illinois.
