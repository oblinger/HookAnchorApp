    "very kind of you

    BUT it really wasn't intentional, the funny faces. hoda took a LOT of
    pictures, but i didn't like most of them (and 95% were me having a
    normal face on), they just were NOT attractive, my eyes seem tiny,
    squarish face,  i just didn't like them. i'm just NOT photogenic!..  the
    only photo that was normal looking of those three isn't all that
    fabulous either, it was just the one that least offended me.

    this is why i was trying to tell you that the tiny work website picture
    i have is actually a good picture of me (this is the one hoda says makes
    me look like a 12 year old). i attached it as well.

    so... i figured better to post pictures where i'm not supposed to look
    attractive (ie when making a face) than unattractive pictures of me...

    ok, i'm done obsessing about my appearance for the next couple months..
    could you post these on your site?

    thanks,

    ysl
