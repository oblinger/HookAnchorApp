    - Test generation techniques



    - Coverage based testing.

    - Reverse the roles of tester and system.  System is sort of testing the user.


    IDEAS
    (1)  Automatic exercising of program parts.
    (1a) Code coverage.

    (2)  techniques for building user confidence

    (3)  Motivation & Surprise,Explain,Reward

    (4)  PBD as debugging ?


    extra stuff we have:
    - trace data users actions
    - program



    ISSUES
    -  How to plan to test parts of system.
    -  Will our users spend time on testing?
