    "Hi Rogan and all,

    Here is some more background information on the configuration complexity 
    benchmarking work I'm doing and the associated process modeling. Please note: 
    with the exception of the overview paper and poster, this information 
    represents ongoing, unpublished work inside IBM Research and may not be further 
    distributed.

    First is a short overview paper (RC23146.pdf), in submission to the SIGOPS 
    European Workshop.



    Next is a poster that provides a slightly more detailed look at the project. 
    Beware, it's one enormous powerpoint slide (abrown-CHIACS.ppt).



    Then I have an XML Schema representation of a process (CapturedCfgProcess.xsd). 
    This is really just a starting point, and needs to be expanded. It has a set of 
    types for configuration parameters/data, but currently it only has a base type 
    for process actions (GenericCAT). Many more specific action types will need to 
    be added once we've built a process model and figured out the appropriate level 
    of abstraction. I've also included an encoding of the DB2+WAS configuration 
    scenario I was describing today (SpecJ2002-DB2-WAS.xml). This is a 
    work-in-progress: again, the configuration parameter taxonomy is reasonably 
    complete, but the process actions are completely ad-hoc and have neither types 
    nor parameterizations yet.



    Finally, I've attached a chart (taxonomy-example.ppt) that shows some of my 
    early thinking on how to structure an abstraction hierarchy of configuration 
    process actions/steps. Again, this is very preliminary--it's more so you get a 
    flavor of what I've been thinking about than a final taxonomy.

    Rogan,

    After suggesting that you set the agenda, I'm instantly going to pre-empt some 
    of your time!   I've invited Aaron Brown to join us on Friday.  He's recently 
    begun to work on developing a semantic model for describing procedures.  He's 
    doing this by going through documented IT procedures, much in the way that we 
    talked about in our last discussion.  I think there may be a natural synergy 
    between the project we've been discussing and Aaron's work, and thought we 
    should have an early discussion.

    Larry

    8am Pacific (11 Eastern) should work fine, I'll have some discussion
    topics to get things started.  You can find me at 541-738-1013.

    Thanks,
    Rogan
