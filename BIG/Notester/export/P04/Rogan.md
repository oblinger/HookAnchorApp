    TODO 8/9
    At least one week BEFORE your student leaves, do the ECFORMS and have them do their TOTALS one week early. See below for details on these things. Please also submit your eval as soon as your student(s) leave as John wants to go through them and we'd like to have the whole set ready asap (and I think HR needs it quickly too).
