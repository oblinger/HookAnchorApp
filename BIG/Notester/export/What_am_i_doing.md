    >Where now?  What do you do?
    I'm on caltrain heading from SF where I live to Menlo.  I will stay in Menlo Park <<>> PA until Friday, then back to the city.

    I am employee #1 for Jotter.com...  This Iranian woman sold her last company to Oracle, and this is her next big thing.  (I am just hired help...  getting things started, and hiring the rest of the team. I have no equity.)  I am 1<<>>2 owner of a second company doing data analytics....  (that is what my PhD. is in.)   So while down in Menlo I am usually doing this second job early mornings, and my co-founder and I usually will do working dinners<<>>evenings a few days a week  (yesterday and tonight this week)

    Just to keep it all interesting, I am also a 1<<>>4 owner of a social impact company that is providing jobs for lightly skilled workers in disadvantaged countries like Kenya or the Philippines.  (a working dinner <<>> evening this Thursday, when I will get our new intern spun up on her monthly tasks).

    But weekends and mondays are free for me to be a human being.

    This week is pretty much shot, but I am usually able to free up a weekday dinner slot if those are better for you.  Weekdays are quite intense, so it is good to give my brain a break during those days.


    > "Many here want to ensure that they are balanced internally before looking to complete themselves externally". Shouldn't it be like that?

    yes it should.  I meditate each morning (ok, ok, most mornings).  and will stop the work I am doing if I note my emotions are not well aligned....   it is the way I can drive hard and not burn out.

    The "Seven Habits" book if you have ever read it, but all three internal facing habits before his three externally facing habit.  I buy it, clean house, before inviting guests in.

    But, none of us is going to have a CLEAN house.  There will always be work to do.
    If you wait till you feel you have a clean house, you will never have that house warming party.
    (I have a best friend in DC and she bought her physical house several years ago....  still no house warming!!  ugh!) 

    but mostly I mean this metaphorically ....


    I have just noted that as a woman cruises thru her 30s she starts to think.
    Ok, maybe I have to be ready to be alone..... forever alone....

    I think it is probably wise to start becoming ok with this.  Just so one does not make bad choices out of desperation.  But as the guy on the other side of this all, I have found cases where I am playing ball with a partner that has already 1/2 way given up on baseball.

    .... as you can see from my earlier description, I am not one to 1/2 play baseball....  


    East coast was much more enthusiastic and goal directed....  but could be age too....


    > COOKING

    did I bring up cooking?

    or are you just warning me early that I should not be counting on you in the kitchen ???
    well no worries, I'm not interviewing for Chef positions  ;-)
