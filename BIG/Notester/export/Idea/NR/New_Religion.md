    New Religion

    * What if both (reductionism, and deism) are right?
    * Have we been sold a bill of goods?  What are the really important bits here?
    * How to approach this new perspective
      (1) if you have faith then you are done.
      (2) if science blocks faith, then consider where you end up if you start with:
          Reductive World Model, Expectation of multiple interpretations, 'gut' sense about what is and is not real.
          ('gut sensed real' means seems like it has predictive/explanative value in world)
      Perhaps many of attributes we feel are important about God can be contained in this interpretation of the
      world.  For me this would be a ground shifting even.  Today I must choose to believe in 'God' or to believe 
      in 'Science'  I must choose between what I want to be true, and at some level feel 'ought' to be true, on
      one hand, and what I seems to be implied by Science on the other hand.
