    COMMANDO COOKING -- get 'er done cooking


    ALWAYS READY -- think MREs -- Only  DRIED, CANNED, or FROZEN
      * We're not shopping ever three days ladies.  We are backing in the Humvee up to
        the loading dock and packing it in for the season.
      * No wasted food going bad, No sweekly planning, Never running out.

    FAST -- no really, I mean fast:
      * Under 10 minutes of prep
        - Going above and beyond:  entire prep can be completed on one breath of air.
      * Less than five main ingredients
      * Three step directions -- mix stuff, heat stuff, eat stuff
        - Going above and beyond:  no heating required.
      * One pot -- all mixing <<>> heating in same container
        - Going above and beyond:  using same container for eating.

    HEALTHY -- lets face it, it is easy to eat fast, but almost all fast stuff
               will 
      * Think meditranian diet -- whole grains, veggies, lean meats, low saturated fats.


    WILLING TO GIVE UP ON
      * Price...  
      * taste... ok, I don't want it to suck, but the fact is, if I cant crank a healthy
        snack out in 60 seconds, or dinner in 10 minutes, I will be in to a bag of chip,
        or a Five Guys 1,500 calorie dinner in a snap.
