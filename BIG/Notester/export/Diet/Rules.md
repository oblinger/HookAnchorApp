# Diet.Rules --

    RULES OF MY LIFE 
    1) Breakfast: zero time; eaten in car or at work. 
    2) Lunch: Flexible; at work 
    3) Snack: Flexible; at work 
    4) Dinner: 50% at home, but I do not know which days will be at 
       home until about an hour before dinner.  I get home late so 
       I am hungry when I get there.  Some weeks will have no dinners 
       at home, others will have all days there. 
    5) Time is at a premium.  I will generally trade taste/variety to gain time.   
    6) Long term planning works well (1 month). 
       Short term planning fails (e.g. this week, or tommorrow) 
    7) I buy/cook for one (myself) 
    8) I shop infrequently and in large quantities to save time. 
    9) Once every dozen weeks, the shit hits the fan; all plans are off, I  
       will not shop & will eat the fastest thing available. 
     
    CONCLUSIONS 
    - Because of #7 and because not all mornings occur at my own house 
      even a single quart of milk will go bad, before I use it. 
      (My meal number #3 requires milk; this happens at most twice a week) 
     
      NOTE: If I just ate kashi for the first days after shopping *every day* 
      this problem could be avoided, but then my Breakfast will not align 
      with my lunch & dinners. 
     
     
    - Because of #4, Pre-prepared, non-frozen foods will spoil. 
     
      NOTE: I could prepare and freeze turkey chili, this would allow 
      me to save time by planning ahead, but since #4 I wont know the exact  
      day it will be eaten so again I cannot align it with the Breakfast of the 
      same day. 
     
     
    Things to work with: 
    - My roomate & I have a very good rice cooker that keeps rice 
      ready to eat for days.  Some/many days rice is ready made.
