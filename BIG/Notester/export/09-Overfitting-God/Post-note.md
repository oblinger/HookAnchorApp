    Well bob...  i mean mark, explain your ass out of this one to 
    alice... i mean carolyn!!  ;-> 
     
    Seriously, I have never really thought this through in such detail 
    before, so I don't quite know if I even buy any of this.  I have to 
    thank you for prompting me to think it through so carefully!  Wouldn't 
    it be cosmic irony if you, my atheistic friend, were responsible for 
    increasing my rather lame ass faith!  Remember there is definitely 
    more Bob than Alice in me too. 
     
    Your manager invited me out to dinner with you and Carolyn this Thursday. 
     
     
    Cheers, 
    Dan
