# Docs.List\_Flows --


    List Flows are used to manage info in the todo list
    * The DAILY WATERFALL FLOW is a sequence of lists used to maintain info that you scan continuously.
    * The CONTEXT LISTS are used to maintain info referenced only in specfic contexts.
    * The PLANNING FLOW is used to maintain longer term (weekly, month, year) planning.

    A single massive todo list is dangerous (because things will get lost and not done in time) and it is
    demoralizing (because you can't make a satisfying dent in a massive todo list in a single sitting).  
    The answer is a cascade of lists organized roughly by decending urgency.  Each list captures a specific 
    group of time-scale and importance sensitivities.  Thus each lower list can safely be ignored for defined
    periods of time, since items are never pushed down if they cannot be ignored for that period of time.
    Having this cascade minimized the number of items you are looking at, which you will not be working
    on.  Over many decades I have evolved this cascade.  Each list has a specific role and urgency.

      |       <<>>             -- Generally kept empty.  Used when item must be attacked "first thing"
      +->Todo/                   -- Primary todo list.  re-order top part of list for short term planning
    <<>>|<<>>____/CAN IGNORE BELOW THIS IN A TIME CRUNCH\<<>>
         |            <<>>    -- Generally kept empty.  Upgrade used for long standing items.
         +->Opportune/           -- To be done as soon as convenient.  Still some time sensitivity.
            |      
            +->B-List            -- Done whenever possible.  Little time pressure.

               +->Quarterly      -- May never be done, but want to be reminded occasionally.


    IN-BOX -- Unsorted Items.  This list must remain short and frequently cleaned since it contains 
    info that is unsorted and could have varying importance.  Items that only require a few minutes
    to complete can simply be performed.  Tab-T-T can also be used to quick throw longer term
    items on the Todo list.

    TODO LIST -- This is your primary action list.  It contains items you are currently working on.
    Each morning the first section of the list (Separated by a black line) is organized into 
    the set of tasks to be performed that day.  The list should remain short, so that it can be scanned
    quickly.  If items are on the list that are not likely to be done in the next few days, they 
    should be moved to the Opportune lists.

    FIRST -- The first list is a specialty list, it should generally remain empty.  If some activity 
    needs to be done 'FIRST' then it can be put there.  In general, activities should not remain
    on this list since you want to train your eyes to lock onto any items on that list.

    OPPORTUNE -- The Opportune list is for items that do not need to be completed at any specific time,
    but nonetheless are time sensitive.  It is scanned at least weekly to determine if items are 
    becoming time critical and thus should be bumped back to the Todo list.  The goal is to spend at 
    least some time each week during the slower periods trying to tackle item on this list.
    This list is a relief valve for the TODO list, but only if you attend to this list occasionally.
    Items that remain on the opportune list for many week are generally lower priority (since
    you have not pushed them back up to the Todo list, and because they have not been completed)
    These items should be pushed down the to B-LIST, below.

    KILLER -- The killer list is a second specialty list like 'First' it is used rarely for those 
    items that week after week are still on the OPPORTUNE list, and for whatever mystical reason
    have some psychological barrier to completion.  Putting them on the 'Killer' list highlights
    them for special attention.  They still have not specific deadline, yet any items you manage
    to complete off the killer list, deserves an extra atta-a-boy, second scoop of ice creme or 
    some such.  

    B-LIST -- The B-list is like the opportune list, in the sense that each item has not deadline, 
    but it additionally is assumed that items on the list are just generally something one wants
    to do, but with little or no time sensitivity.  This list can grow as large as needed, since
    it does not need to be scanned on a regualar basis.  Still if it grows too large there is little
    point, since you will never attend to the items on it.  

    QUARTERLY LIST -- This list is the final list, it accept overflow from the B-LIST that is 
    unlikely to be worked on for weekes or months.  This list can grow as large as needed.
    It only contains items that have lower or very long term importance, and no required timeframe.
    One should scan this list a few times a year to see if any items can be deleted, or if any items
    deserve upgrading because of boosted importance.  This list also serves as a relief valve.  
    Unlike the other lists in the waterfall this list is not even listed on the primary 
    view screen.  It is a place to shove those lower priority items that you cant quite
    bring your self to deleting (and thus admitting that you will never do them) and yet to
    keep those lower priority distractor off your primary screen, and off your mind.
    Since you will always scan the whole list a few times a year, you can rest assurred that if
    you find the time to pull things off that list, you will not have forgotten them.  Unlike other
    lists, it is fine if this list grows arbitrarily large.

    Context lists are used to track less time sensitive items, which additionally can only be acted 
    upon in a given context.  This keeps these items from uselessly taxing your attention in contexts 
    where the items cannot be addressed.   

    > AGENDA  --  Each entry in this list cooresponds to a single peron, single weekly meeting, 
                  single location.  The idea is that when you go to that context, you can look at
                  the AGENDA for that context.

    > CALL    --  List of calls to make.  It is useful if you provide the phone number in the entry inself
                  to reduce inertia against making call, and also helps in contexts where number is unavailable.

    > HOME    --  List of personal or home items.  This is the 'inbox' for home view screen.

    > JOY     --  Things that don't *need* to get done, but are fun to do.
                  Rather than break your grove when they come to you, save them for a reward,
                  or for when you are just at the end of your productive day.

    > NET     --  Actions requiring a net connection, or net research.  Surfing is both useful
                  and time consuming.  This category is like 'Joy' in that it can be done when
                  you need time away from other activities.

    > VERIFY  --  Actions being done by others which you want to remind yourself to verify once completed
                  at some future time.

    Planning flows are used for more longer term planning.  This waterfall proceeds from the
    longest term planning list down to the actions to be taken this week.  Once a week these lists
    are scanned and items are pushed onto the 'WEEK' list as a plan for the week.

    +->Roles               - Roles within your life.  (see Seven Habits)
       +->Goals            - Goals stemming from these goals.         
          |         <<>>  - Projects that are no longer active projects, but are not completed
          +->Active/       - The active and proj lists are used to keep track of goals not generated from Roles/Goals
             +->Prime      - Subset of active projects shown on main screen.  (Scanned each week)
    --------------> Week   - Items from all lists placed onto a weekly plan.



    ROLES -- The Roles list is taken from Steven Covey's Seven Habits book.  It is broken into sublists 
    or subentries capturing all the major aspects of your life.  In each subcategory are your lifetime 
    aspirations for that Role.  Writings and entries here form ones largest compass.  Viewed as 
    circumstance dictates, it quickly reminds you of your most recent thinking on each topic.

    GOALS -- Again from the Seven Habits, these goals are long standing objectives deriving from the 
    roles listed above.  

    ACTIVE -- The list of all active projects.  In some cases you may also list subprojects directly
    in this list if you want to scan them weekly.  

    PRIME -- Items from the active list that you wish to be aware of on a daily basis.  A few projects
    are so active that items may be attacked even though you did not consider doing so during 
    weekly planning.  Such *few* projects can be listed here.  This list can also serve as a quick
    glance reminder of all the large balls you currently have in the air.


    WEEK -- The Week list is the workhorse of the planning lists.  Each week the planning lists are
    scanned (either briefly or in depth) and possible work items for the week are identified.
    Then the week list itself is organized so items that must get done are in the top group, items
    that might get done are in the next group.  A third group can be created for items that are still
    timesensitive, but will be pushed into next week.  (The week list should not scroll,  move items to 
    OPPORTUNE, or ACTIVE if too many items on week list.)


    OTHER LISTS


    DECIDE
    Things that require a decision.  (I don't like this list, since
    it is not clear when it should be acted upon, instead
    I place thing on Todo, Opportune, or B-List as appropriate.
