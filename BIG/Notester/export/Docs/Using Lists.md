# Docs.Using Lists --


    Notester lists & commands are designed to make certain usage pattern very easy and
    efficient.  Here we briefly describe how the lists are intended to be used.

    * Notester shows the *top* of a number of many lists all at once,
      this means if the tops of each list is organized to be the most important
      stuff on the list, then you can see all important info on one screen without 
      clicking or scrolling.

    * Action flow lists:  (First, Inbox, Home, Todo, Opportune, Monitor, Week, and Prime)
      are viewed frequently to decide what is most important at the time.  Thus
      it is critical that they be relatively short.  There is no point in having 
      many items on these lists, you wont have time to do all those items anyway.
      Each of those lists has a natural lower priority list where items can be pushed.
      Be realisitic, items that are not going to be done in the next few days do not
      belong on your todo list.

    * On the spot prioritization and grouping.  By just moving items within list and
      by placing blank lines in a list you can create subcategories instantly on the spot.
      For example, you can push all items that you *must* do today to the top of
      the TODO list (with the 'u' command).  Then a blank line can separate them from 
      the rest of the list.  The 'm'+'e' command (move end) could be use to move other
      items that will be done tomorrow to the end of the list.
