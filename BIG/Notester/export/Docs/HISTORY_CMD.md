# Docs.HISTORY\_CMD --


    The history command is a specialized search which is invoked by TAB-S-H  (Search History).
    It will scroll through the edit history for the current note.  

    The following keyboard commands are used to control the history mode:
      'N'  moves to the 'NEXT' version later in time.
      'P'  moves to the 'PREVIOUS' version earlier in time.
      ' '  exits history mode.  (So does )
      'A'  will 'ACCEPT' an earlier version of a note as the current value for the note.
      '?'  will display a short help message listing these options.
