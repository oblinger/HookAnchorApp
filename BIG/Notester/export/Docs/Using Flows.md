    The first goal of Notester is ensure that you are organized enough to not drop the ball
    on important activities--to always know what are the most important activities for right now.
    The second goal is require as little of your precious time to maintain as possible.  
    The third goal is for this organization to have the flexibilty to continue working even 
    through those inevitable periods where crap is hitting the fan, and only the barest 
    organizational efforts are possible.

    It is these goals that underly the notion of Notester Flows.  Notester flows are simple procedures 
    you use to decide what to do next, to plan your day, to organize information, etc.  

    You should optomize these for you own life, but it is important to have *simple* *concrete*
    processes that ensure that important things get done, information is reasonably organized, etc.
    Most of these flows are common sense, but the need to become second nature if you are to actually
    follow them.  Here are the three primary flows I have developed in using notester:
