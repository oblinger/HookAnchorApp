# Docs.WITHIN\_CMD --


    This command directly jumps to the <<>> 'within project' submenu.
    These menu entries create Activities, Journal Entries, Meeting Notes, and Subprojects all within
    the current project.  (Creation under a different project is accomplished by selecting another project)
    All entries except journal entries generally should be named at creation time (by entering text in the dialog box).
