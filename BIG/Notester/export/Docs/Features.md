    NOTESTER IS DIFFERENT!

    Many people stick w. rudimentary orgnaizational tools (e.g. text file, folders, pencil paper, wall calendar)
    because they contain features often lost by advanced tool.  Notester attempts first to *NOT* loose these features:

     * Info is in plain text with fixed width font.  
       - No dialog boxes, control buttons etc to create links, or pages.
       - Cut and paste works between all info
     * Info is in folders in your filesystem under your organizational control
     * All entered info is ordered by time like a journal
     * History of all entered info is remembered also like a journal
     * Ad hoc organization is supported in several ways:
       - lists can be sub grouped on the fly by inserting blank lines (and Notester understands the groups)
       - all text is fixed width font, so tables, outline organizations, and others can be simply created manually
         and linked with <<>> as needed to give semantics.

    Notester is FAST FAST FAST
     * No saving
     * Non-chorded modeless keyboard operation.  
     * Neumonic command<<>>list names for quick memorization
     * Cockpit style design provides large amounts of info without having to "go" to the appropriate screen
     * Shortcut links directly to active folders 


    Notester effectively manage massive amounts of info.
     * Cascading lists ensure that there is always somewhere to push info out of the way w<<>>o loosing it.
     * Sohisticated project <<>> subproject architecture allows breaking data down
     * Temporally named verses Permanently named notes allows for automatic regressing old info




    JOURNAL  --  Retains some important advantages of the venerable notebook journal
      * Setup time is fast, FAST, *FAST*.
      * "Save" command does not exist.  As with a notebook saving is implict.
      * Information can be added without naming it or filing it.
      * You can flip thru information entered in the order entered.
      - One disadvantage is that it is on your computer screen, and only accessible
        when computer is accessible.


    PLAIN TEXT  --  Retains the many advantanges of plain text that many organizational tools loose.
      * You get rich subtle structuring  (uses fixed width font)
      * Cut and paste
      * Data moves between tools
