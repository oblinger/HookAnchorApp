    [TODO] 
      . wait for text then 
        write figures to match 
      . Call Rich Caruana  
        on multi-task learning

    - Australian   
      Maarten Van Someren  (want to characterize learning algs 
      in terms of their high level features) 
     
     
     
    Idea: View learning task as rerepresenting input attrs to output attr 
     
     
     
    Idea: rerep hyp space directly 
     
    - biases should be represented in pieces. 
      This allows better transfer between domains. 
     
    - possible bias-reps with high potential power: 
      - feature re-rep languages 
      - hyp transformation operators 
     
    EXAMPLE 
    - system should be able to rerep problem 
      weighting examples by their recency.
