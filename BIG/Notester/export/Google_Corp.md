    - SOCIAL CUBE -- Mother of a Data Cubes
      - specialized indexing for primary axes  sharp fuzzy boundaries
      - Geek generated, task specific offline E-M models
      - auto defaulting, feedback following, dual controlled

    - GRAMMAR GRABBER -- Domain specifc relational Grammar mappings

    - WIKI EXO-NETS
      let people teach google an overlay organization for arbitrary data.
      e.g. DAG of ATTR <<>> VAL objects & pages

    - ZIP-CODER -- Exo-spatial mapping  (cvt to zipcode)

    - Map driven searching.
      e.g.  these special searches are all indexed off a current map
      e.g.  I went to get Zipcodes
      e.g.  Trace a path or a polygon and search from it
      e.g.  what are the names of the buisnesses near this buisness
            (I want to order takeout from that great thai spot just down from whole foods)
            Just a tiny subset of the relations that humans already understand well would
            provide a powerful simple search constraint

    - really search can be understood as appliction of constraint to a mother 'select' operation
      give users GUIs to specify specialized constraints then carry them around.

    *** Dont let flaky get in the way of providing it, just somehow
        brand it differently if needed.

    - CoRef machine.
      * 50 people solving one problem.  what is a "thing" and when does it map to 
        other places that refer to the same "thing"

      * Let browse the web with the GOOG exho-thing mapping connecting the parts
      * Use collaborative filters at item/category/source level 

    - META META

    - DECLARATIVE/COMPOSITIONAL SYSTEM SPEC -- Declarative System Spec
      * Both android and chrome brower & os
      * You might think you are already doing this, but you are not unless
        - drag drop mix match recursive system state across machines
        - like his system 'except'   then update the underlying system!
        - auto binary serach to id failure.
        - track deltas from generic setup (organized by group & importance)
