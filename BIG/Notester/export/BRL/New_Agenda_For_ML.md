# BRL.New\_Agenda\_For\_ML --


    The Current ML agenda is devising ever more cleaver ways of specifying 
    prior knowledge in order to strengthen subsequent learning, or in
    some way relaxing assumptions made by existing inductive techniques.

       The logical end of this trajectory is flexible suite of modelling tools.


    A related by ultimately distinct reserach agenda is the agenda of
    developing an artifical intelligence comparible with a human intelligence.
    we wont accidentally generate such learning by following 

    Learning in that context will abide by a different set of constraints, 
    in particular there is no one there to program the learning bias, or even
    delineate the leraning tasks.

    I will show in this talk, that if we drill down on the goal of building 
    an artificial intelligence to the machine learning requrired we obtain
    problem specification which differs from existing ML in some important ways.

    this agenda can be idealized to produce a new set of learning objectives.
    Obtaining progress on these new objectives  will require DARPA
    I hope to present an agenda 

    related to existing ML in some ways, but
    none
