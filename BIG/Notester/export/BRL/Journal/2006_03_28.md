    A Long Standing Promise of AI
    Systems that can be taught rather than programmed

    How are we doing?


    * If we compare heights ML has achieved to those of human learning
      they are as different our tallest building is to the moon

    * Indeed algorithms that model datasets (most of ml today)
      arent even of the right qualitative kind to do
      the cumulative learning needed to get to that moon of indefinite
