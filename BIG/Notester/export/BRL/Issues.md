# BRL.Issues --

    FINAL TODOS
    * Get good estimate of ladder cost.
    * Who is building the shrink wrapped code?
    * Verify Performer Organization.   Meet Doug (in contracts) about performer organization
    * Flesh transfer domain examples
    * Replace running example with UAV examples
    * Rework budget with time varying evaluation and ladder costings
    * tentative list of potential performers

    * talking notes for each slide.



    - 1099
    - moving
    - schwab cost basis (laudus intl. market masters.    Qsip 808 509 8889)
    - current cost basis





    - ladder: Military manual of strategy.
      - applied to serious games.

    Talk to peter.
    - get Urban op manual
    - get the rice paddies and viet nam.

    What different assumptions am *I* making  (on slide #1)


    BIG OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS

    + WHAT DOMAINS ARE HIGHLIGHTED
      + MILITARY TRANSFER:  Simulations; Situational Awareness in cog world; AUVs

    + METRICS & MILESTONES

    + BUDGET

    + DETAILS FOR EVERY SLIDE:  LADDER API; BOOTSTRAPPING REPRESENTATION

      + WHAT ARE THE LEARNING PROCESSES


    [DONE]    HOW ARE PERFORMERS ORGANIZED
      - Initially in small teams;  first year individual teams demonstrate bootstrapping
      + WHO SELECTS THE BOOTSTRAPPING APIs


    BIG GOALS
    - Initial Verions of Ladder API; Bootstrapping API; and Learning processes




    TIMELINE
    0.75  Ladder API for initial three ladders
    1.00  RED:  3 ladders
          BLUE:  Bootstrapping within team on their own ladder
    1.50  Bootstrapping API defined.
    2.00  BLUE:  Learning across teams and
