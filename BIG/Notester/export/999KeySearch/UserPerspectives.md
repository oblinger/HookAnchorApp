    [THE AUTHOR] 
     
    After spending an afternoon creating a page for the Watson IBM Softball 
    league, Jackie, wants to link it into the IBM intranet.  To do this she: 
     
    - Browses to the W3 intranet key-search page, clicks "ADD LINK",  
      and types in IBM-Club.  Since she arrived at this search engine from  
      the W3.Watson.Ibm.Com, page it already knows her location is Watson,  
      and so it returns the IBM-Club page local to Watson.   
    - She clicks "ADD CHILD", and types in a title "Women's Softball League." 
      Four prior entries exist with similar names, she specifies that her is 
      an "additional entry" in the "Women's Softball" sub-category.
