    >  A Husband Shopping Center has opened where a woman can go to choose a
    >  husband from among many men. It is laid out in five floors, and the
    >  men increase in positive attributes as the shopper ascends the
    >  flights.  There is, however, a catch. As you open the door to any
    >  floor you may choose a man from that floor, but if you go up a floor,
    >  you cannot go back down, except to exit the building.
    >
    >  So, a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband.  On the
    >  first floor the sign on the door says: Floor 1: These men have jobs
    >  and love kids. The woman reads the sign and thinks "Well that's better
    >  than not having jobs, or not loving kids, but I wonder what's further
    >  up?"
    >
    >  So up she goes.
    >  The second floor sign says:
    >  Floor 2: These men have high paying jobs, love kids, and are extremely
    >  good looking. "Hmmm, better." says the woman. "But, I wonder what's
    >  further up?"
    >
    >  The third floor sign reads:
    >  Floor 3: These men have high paying jobs, love kids, are extremely
    >  good looking, and help with the housework.
    >
    >  "Wow," says the woman, "very tempting. BUT, there's must be more
    >  further up!" And, again, she goes up.
    >
    >  On the fourth floor the sign reads:
    >  Floor 4: These men have high paying jobs, love kids, are extremely
    >  good looking, help with the housework, and have a strong romantic
    >  streak.
    >
    >  "Oh, mercy me! But just think...what must be awaiting me further on?
    >  So up to the fifth floor she goes.
    >
    >  The sign on that door says:
    >  Floor 5: This floor is just to prove that women are impossible to
    >  please. Thank you for shopping and have a nice day.
