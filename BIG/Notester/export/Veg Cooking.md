    -------------------------------------------
    STIR FRY:  Vinegarette, 
    BASIC:  2 tbsp. soy sauce,          2 tbsp. water or broth, 
            1 tbsp. plain/rice vinegar, 1 tbsp. Chinese rice cooking wine or dry sherry, 
            a pinch of sugar, and 1 to 2 tsp. of Asian chili garlic sauce (or a few dashes of Tabasco). 
            Whisk in 1 tsp. cornstarch as a thickener. 
    --------------------------------------------



    Yes, I'm running behind. Here's the peanut sauce we use (and used just last night):

    1/2 c. peanut butter
    1/2 c. water
    1/4 c. soy sauce
    1 Tbs rice vinegar
    1 tsp to Tbs hot sesame oil
    2 Tbs brown sugar (optional)

    Multiply as needed and just mix that up. It makes a thick peanut sauce that can store for a long time. When you're ready to use it, put a bit of oil in a wok and stir fry whatever suits your fancy. (Just last night, we threw in some garlic and broccoli. After cooking for a minte, we added some water and covered, to make sure the broccoli was well steamed. Then we removed the lid and added lots of seitan bits.) Once everything's cooked to your taste, pour the desired amount of peanut sauce, stir till thick, then eat.

    I don't have the brown sauce recipe with me (sorry), but I'll send it along soon.

    As for the different grillers: I honestly have no idea.

    Oh, the third sauce I recommended having around was aoli: garlic mayonaise. You can make it with light mayo. Just mash up some garlic in a mortar and pestle (or any other way you desire), and mix it well with mayo. Experiment to get a good balance. If you're going to let it sit, go easy on the garlic; the flavor just intensifies over time.
