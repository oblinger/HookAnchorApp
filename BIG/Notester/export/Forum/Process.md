    THE PROCESS
    ===========

    SUBMISSION
    Participants continuously submit notes, revisions, and retractions.


    The issues taxonomy is built by recursively selecting the summary 
    with greatest support and least contention.  This taxonomy extends 
    down to the points of contention.  
    (What about major/minor points not in summary?)

    Summaries for points of contention are selected by support.
    They must include all major and minor positions.  If
    great contention exists over the best summary, moderators, may select
    one, or allow alternatives to be arranged.

    Positions are ranked based on the support provided to them as major, 
    minor, or proposed.  Each participant may support at most one position 
    for a point.  Only after they have thrown their support behind a position
    can they support or oppose its justification sub-structure.

    Summaries can be written for 











    - Varient issue wordings that are most widely supported and least contentions
      are endorsed.  (

    VARIENTS
    A set of nodes with the same parent may be declared varients.
    This declaration may be supported or opposed by the participants.


    AUTHORING 
    Any participant may submit an Issue, Point, Position, or Opinion.

    RENDERING SUPPORT

    A note of support (or opposition) may optionally include a justification
    for the opinion.


    DETAILS
    =======

    Cross listing -- Because of varients in the tree, cross-listing
    a node under multiple parents should be allowed, but support
    should be afforded such and entry only if the participant is satisfied
    with its placement under *all* parents.
