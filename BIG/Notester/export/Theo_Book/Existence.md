# Theo\_Book.Existence --

    CONCLUSIONS:
     - Many important and "obvious" aspects of world dont actually exist (according to narrow exists)
     - Appropriate 'exists' predicate is two place
     - any dissatisfaction w. this exists really is due to non-reductive model of self & exists,
       once accepted, this new exists seems like the right exists predicate.
     - But, exists is now not enough, many things can 'exist' in this new sense, yet not have the properties
       that we might ascribe to things that exist, in the old sense.  Once we determine that something exists, we must
       go on to determine what does it mean, that it exists.


    [[[EXISTENCE]]]
    A PRACTICAL NOTION OF EXISTENCE:   WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SOMETHING TO EXIST?
    - Starting assumptions, things like "the cup in your mom's cubbord" really does exist.
      a lump of stuff; a Cup; Atoms; Microsoft Word; The game of chess
      - different senses of the word exist, but saying that a cup, an atom, or microsoft word dont exist in the 
        same way that a clump of matter exists is true but not very useful for our purposes.  In a practical 
        sense they all do exist.
      - Thus we acknoweldge there are many types of 'exist' and further we will admit a type of existence if
        it somehow has an impact on the world we percieve.
      - A no nonsense approach to existence
        (1) There are multiple sense in which something can exist
        (2) Some of these senses of existences are are fuzzy they have slippy slopes w/o clear boundaries
            they may not be precisely definable (or may require making rather arbitrary determinations in order
            to make them precise.  (which atoms are make up our bodies)
        (3) We accept multiple senses of exists in spite of these problems.
        We are going to be pragmatists, we will admit a notion of existence if it seems to help explain aspects
        of the world we perceive, even if it gets us forces us into deep ontological quandries.
        If the person on the street would say that something exists in some sense after a discussion about it, 
        then we accept that it does exist in that "some sense", philosophers be damned.

    - Thinking entities like you and I exist.
    - The question is does God exist in this practical sense of exist, like a cup, like you or like myself?


    EXISTENCE
    - Believing in it results in effective prediction.
    - Existence is not "all or nothing"  but thing really have different levels of existence 


    * we  belive that one should adopt the perspective modern physiscit adopts toward newly proposed laws or particles.
      they neither exist nor don't exist at first.  they can be found to be inconsistent, consistent, supported, or vindicated
      by empirical data.  those are the "real" levels of existance according to modern science.

    non-scientific notion of existence.  there is an objective reality, some this "really really" exist, and
    the four levels above are simply our imperfect understanding of what "realy really" exists.  Perhaps this
    is true, but if it is, we have not shown it to be so in the scientific world view.  the number of 
    interlocking "vindicated" facts suggests that some objective reality does exist, but it is hardly
    a proof of it.  Physics believe this is not a relevant question for them, since they can never know
    anything beyond "vindicated" existence anyway.  All facts are subject to overturn.
    We can prove the existance of anthing beyond this level of vindication, so we should not be surprised
    that we cannot prove the existance of God, say, beyond the level of vindication.  
    Thus we must put our foot down here.  The only relevant questions to be asked about Spirituality
    are the four levels of existence above.  disappointment that we don't know if god really really exists
    should be expressed as dissapponitment that we don't know if a cup really really exists.  
    Perfect sucess here would be to know God exists with the same level of certainty that we know that
    a cup exists.

    In this text we argue that some aspects of the spiritual realm are vindicated by current human understanding
    other parts are supported, and some consistent.  (As many readers may suspect there are probably some (many)
    theological beliefs that are inconsistent with the current scientific world view as well. We wont dwell on 
    these since they are what the athiest reader already expects, and
    they in no way detract from beliefs we find with higher degrees of support.)
