    SECTION: REDUCTIONISM

    * Stance of this book is we will explain world purely in reductive terms, that is...

    * I am compelled to do this because of the wide support reducto has
     
    * But many would argue that we have no basis to apply reducto to theo
      - they are correct
      - and I honor non-reductive and even envy such world views

    * However I am always uncomfortable when I "try to wear those therories"
      - I feel I am tricking myself
      - Indeed I feel in today's world many have 'two minds' one of science and one of theo
      - Now if that works, stop reading, you don't need this book
      - But others feel empty since they want meaning, but ultimately cannot accept theo
        and thus fall back on sci/reducto with no meaning

    * After many years of such osciloating, not just wanting to believe in God, but
      also feeling that "there really was *something* there" I land on
      the philosophy/religion outlined here.

    * At its core, I build up all that I can from reductionism alone, 
      - not because I know that it is right, but rather because any meaning 
        built of this stuff is meaning I know I can accept w/o feeling duplicitous
      - I have been so happy with the result, I am writing about it.


    IMPLIED -ISMS
    * EMERGENTISIM that things really live on multiple levels of abstraction
      (This is the stuff that is 'reducted')
    * MULTI-CAUSALISM
      (At least the causes at the different levels)



    SECTION: EXISTENCE

    We are already half reductionists, but because of our culture, we are not fully 
    reductionist, and it is this lingering non-reductive perspective that causes 
    dissatistfaction with conclusions that we draw about the world.  It is not that 
    the world has no meaning, it is that we have are confusing definionions of meaning
    from different perspectives.  We use a non-reductive form of meaning, and then
    show reductively that such our lives have no meaning.  We set our selves for failure.

    As you read on you will feel this point is obvious, but I bet that, obvious as it may
    be, you are guilty of not respecting the point in your thinking.  Banishing this
    form of thinking is so important that I give it an early chapter.

    EXAMPLE: (put it later)  giving a test that cannot be passed, but then faulting the thing
             that failed, when it does.
        - Imagine we have a plausible argument why super oxegenated blood is linked to cancer.
        - so we test people, and on the basis believe they are at increasted cancer risk.
        - Later someone discovers that all blood must be super ox, yet we continue to 
          conclude increased cancer risk.
        - this makes not sense.  If the test cannot be passed, then it is not testing anything
          period.  It has no meaning.


    CELLS DONT EXIST
    * Existence is a slippy thing.
    * I am comfortable believing that my body is composed of cells, cause we can see them
      at least under a microscope.
    * But of course we know they don't exist in a physical sense.
      - not of a particular composition
      - not of a particular organization
      - not as a par
    * You might argue that in given enough time you could formalise exactly which 
      conformations of matter do and do not form a cell.
    * Perhaps, but I argue that what really exists is iscohedra (4pointed) lots of them.
      Groups of four atom nuclei without any other nuclei inside of them, form the
      basis out of which we are built.  *THAT* is what really is there.
      Cells are just in your imagination.

    * We have all see this logic, and know that cells really do exist, and that iscohedra 
      do exist too, but that the latter dont exist is any really meaningful way
      (that we know of), since mentally organizing the world in that way provides us little
      insight into the world, whereas mentally organizing the world into cells does 
      has predictive value.

    Yes, yes, yes.  All obvious stuff.  Execept if I explained to you that God really
    exists too, but he is just patterns in the ways that people interact with each other.
    You would groan and say, no come on, that is not *really* existing.  I mean yes
    it is a pattern, and yes it can cause dramatic events to occur within the world
    but that is just mental trickery, it is not *really* existing, like some dude
    hanging in the cloud with lightning bolts at his disposal.

    I expect God to exist according to some non-reductive meaning of exists, but then I
    make reductive arguments to myself that: this and that don't provide evidence of 
    God since I can explain them away reductively.  THIS MAKES NO SENSE !!
    Somehow I am expecting God to be *more* real than the cells in my own body?!
    No I would be quite happy being as certain about God, as I am certain that my body
    is composed of cells!

    How did I fall into this trap?  Because I bought a reductive world view, but didn't 
    really switch over to a reductive definition of existence.

    Now I still think one should be skeptical that God really exists, and he is just
    patterns in human interaction.  Not because such an existence is somehow not real, but
    because we have no basis to believe that such interactions give rise to the kind
    of sentient, omnipitent, etc. being that some take God to be.  Still, there
    is a critical shift in our thinking here:

    If we did show that patterns in human behavior could be interpreted as thoughts and
    actions of a sentient being, then we would beleive it *really* was God, and that God
    was as real as the cells in our body.

    there is no sense in which such a thing is less real the our own cells!!

    So now at least we know what are are looking for:  patterns and levels of abstraction 
    that provide meaning (predictive structure in our world)

    Even in writing this, I feel like it is a trick.  that even if we find such patterns
    they may be useful, and even "kind of real", but not as real as the cells in my body.

    But I now believe that this feeling of tricking myself is what is incorrect here.
    Indeed such patterns are real.  They are as real as the cells in my body.
    the problem is, I have been tricking myself all along about just how real the cells in my
    body are!


    BUT WAIT HOLD UP
    * ok, so I have been unrealisting is goal for existence of God  
      and yes, I would be happy to discover a God no more real than my cells
    * But, God a pattern among interactions between humans still seems like clap-trap
      not because he does exist, but becase such a God doesn't have any of the properties
      I associate with God.  What part simulates his white beard, etc.
    * Still it was never the details of God that mattered to me.  
      I wonder which of the properties of God do seem to exist.  I am sure that 
      I cannot defend all properties in say the christian world view in purely reductive
      terms, but I now wonder.  Given this new perspective what properties do we know
      exist in this reductive frame?  That exploration is the rest of the book.



    CHAPTER TWO -- Exploring with a new compass

    Now we embark with a new compass--a new perspective to reexplore all that we believe
    to be true of the world around us.  Before we start, it is useful to review the key
    feature of this new compass:
    (1)  Reductive   -- all is composed from smaller
    (2)  Emergent    -- existence, meaning, stuff that really matter are all emergent
                        phenomenon.  this is what we are looking for.
    (3)  Meaning     -- A representation is meaningful if it makes unique predictions
    (4)  Multicausal -- having one explaination does not diminish another explanation as
                        long as the second explanation provides its own predictive value
    (5)  Never say   -- somehting might be a consequent of natural selection for example, 
          'merely'      but we should never say it is 'just' a consequence of natural selection
                        as if to preclude or even diminish possibility that it is because of
                        something else too.  Each cause must be defended, but none conflict.
                        Thus the "well X is *just* Y" reasoning from this new perspective.
                        If we have two theories, each must stand on its own; must provide predictions
                        more accurately or more easily than other theories within some domain.
    (6)  Imprecision -- a definiton of cell must be less precise than a definion of a isohedra, 
                        still it is the more meaningful.

    --Never Say Just-- (remove #5)
    On the point of 'multi-causal' we must banish the 'oh X is just caused by Y' kind of thinking...

    It is the nature of ears to hear, and the reason our ear canal is open is becasue the open canal 
    allows us to hear better.  We banish line of reasoning that says 'no, no, it may seem that way
    but *really* this is just an effect of natural selection, and in another universe there might be
    no ear at all, or it might have a different function.  Natural selection is why the ear canal 
    is open.  Wrong thinking!!  It might be the case that natural selection is also a cause, but reasoning 
    that the function of an ear is to hear is a great way to understand and predict things about ears
    that would be very hard to predict from natural selection.  

    --On Imprecision--
    On this last point, we are moving into a very imprecise realm, but one that potentially
    has great meaning for our lives, thus a good deal of imprecision is ok and even expected.
    * indeed look at that transitions from physics to chemistry to cell biology to biology to 
      psychology to socialogy.  Each one tends to work with concepts that are less precise
      that the previous.  It is the nature of that level of abstraction.  We accept it as
      it is, and dont fault cell biology that is it not as precise as sub-atomic physics
      since that is the level of precision that we seem to get at that level, and even
      with the lower level of precision we still have a very useful (for our lives perhaps
      more useful) theory of the world.
    * In the same way, we should expect theories of theology might work with concepts
      even fuzzier than those in the other sciences... go with it.  Remember, the goal
      here is to have a theory that provides preditive value, and helps explain the universe
      we live in--not to artifically impose a level of precision that is not helpful for that
      level--nor to fault this level as somehow less correct than others.  Indeed perhaps
      it is simply a next level in chain of abstractions listed above.

    And what colors do we expect To Find?
    * Grey.  What we have found so far in science has been such, and these concepts being
      the furtherest out will only magnify that already present property.
    * How shall we deal with this?  Pragmatically!  Just as in the case with cells
      in the human body, we simply said:  It povides considerable predictive value to 
      operate as if cells exists, thus lets dispense with philosophical finer points & 
      dispense with debates over precise definitions, and simply assert they do exist and be done with it.
    * Same approach, if it seems that a model provides useful predictive properties, then
      lets accept it and move on.  


    OK GO!  WHAT DO I THINK FORM MEANING IN THE WORLD AROUND ME?

    Agents/consciousness/goals/etc.  (all accepted from the previous psychological level)

    Good/Evil
    * these are at Nexus of many related things
    * multiple definitions
      - tied with states of being of an agent
      - tied with actions of an agent
      - tied with states of the world or of parts of the world, and with systems (civilization)
      - tied with effects
