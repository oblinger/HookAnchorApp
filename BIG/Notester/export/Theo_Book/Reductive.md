# Theo\_Book.Reductive --


    === BASE MODEL ===

    the lowest physical model.

    - It is ok with us if the lowest level turns out not to be the lowest level.
    - If might be ok if there is an infinite regress of lower levels???

    === REDUCTIVE MODEL ===
    - A purely reductive model of the universe posits that everything that we observe in this universe, indeed
      that everything, is at one level of description derived from some low-level physical processes that underpin
      the universe.  

    - According to this model most everything that we care about is an emergent property of this lower physical representation.
      It is correct to say that all of these emergent properties and observations are "because" of the interactions
      at this lowest? level.

    === OUR ASSUMPTIONS ===
    - All supported observation (past&present) appears to be consistent with a reductive model of the universe.
    - Reductive model is a very powerful model of world, seems to be *a* good way to understand the world
      (this makes no claim to be *the* way to understand world)
    - Many times we have observed aparantly non-reductive properties, turn out to be reductve (but-emergent)
      properties in world.

    THEREFORE:  Our stance is to assume the universe and all we care & and can know about is purely reductive.
    That is, *all* things happen consistent with some lowest level physical model.  At one level of analysis, 
    the universe is all that is, and there is nothing in the universe that is not a consequent of this lowest 
    physical model.

    Note: we are not asserting that we know all to be purely redutive, but is it a simple powerful model, so we 
    seek to understand what kind of spirituality can exist within this framework.
