    INDEX
    - Introdution: our perspective; goals of the text
      - two mechanisms employed: explicit xlation of terms, thought experiments
    - Mischief caused by mixing perspectives
      - some of the skepticism about theology is really unacknlowedged conflict between tennants of
        these differing world perspectives.
      - Bridging these two ontologies: a working definition of existence
      - As needed we will use our common sense to pin down aspects of a term then craft a definition
        (or definitions) of that term using the perspective of our scientific world view.
        Theological questions are then asked in this new vocabulary.  This translation is necessary, 
        since skepticism about questions asked in the old vocabluary may simply be skepticism about the
        old vocablary itself, not about any answer given to those questions.
      - Does this translation lose important aspects of the original world view?
        Quite possibly (give example) but it is the only way for science to weigh in, and
        we will see it does not lose all important aspects... science can weigh in on many impt questions.

    - Death of God by Reductionism 

    - Crafting, or cutting the spiritual world by occams Razor

    - THE PAC WORLD

    - THE BIGGIE:  DOES GOD EXIST?
      - what do we mean by this?  Many senses of our currently theological understanding of God

    - THEOLOGICAL QUESTIIONS

    - THE SKEPTICS RETORT
      - why the skeptic?
      - What can we expect: multiple reasons, simple reasons, isomorphic reasons
      - It is all just programming
      - It is all just evolution
      - It is just the nature of sentience

      - Could a universe exists where evolution did not drive it?
        (If not does that make evolution and its inherent consequenes and invarient that creates goodness
         i.e. is it God)
