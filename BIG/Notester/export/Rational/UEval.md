    ALLAN TATE COLLABORATION WIKI

    FYI, my focus this year is on collaborative development, which has many aspects.  All the teams I'm working with communicate on this wiki:

    While your work may not be directly related, it may be of interest to this emerging community.   
    I don't have a documented vision, but there are some presentations here that may be a place to start:

    Your thoughts would be welcome.

    Hi Allan,

    You mentioned when we were up in Lexington that you have a Visio presentation 
    of the UEval.  We've been studying the detailed .doc file that you sent us, but 
    haven't seen the presentation.  Could you pass that along?

    Thanks,
    Larry
