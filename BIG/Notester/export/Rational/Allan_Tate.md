    >>> I'm interested in using his work to create a "show me" type experience for evaluations.

    In terms of IBM technology that could be leveraged in the future, I'm beginning to engage with a couple of folks:

    John Medicke:  Bob Noble connected me with John.  Ashok & I are meeting with him next Monday to exchange project information.  He's working on "SMB Building Block Consulting tool."  targeted at process simplification for system integrators.  John's project is much more ambitious and has a different target.  Nevertheless, he shares a desire to greatly simplify the experience and shorten "time to value".  When the unassisted evaluation project started (long ago), we had dreams of helping with first time deployments, but decided to narrow the project scope to stay focused.  Perhaps we'll be able to revisit the "first time deployment" problem soon next year.

    Dan Oblinger:  Dan is working on a research project called "personal wizards".  I saw the PW project at the weekly Rational <<>> IBM Research call.  The user facing experience is a tool that presents a procedure for a task and will walk you through it -- doing the mouse clicks & data entry for you step by step.  Based on prior discussions, this part is similar in concept to Eclipse "cheat sheets" or the OS 9.x help system from Apple.  The difference is that Dan's team has a way to generate procedures by observing human experts -- minimizing programming and easing maintenance of the procedures.  I'm interested in using his work to create a "show me" type experience for evaluations.  There are a number of other potential applications for PWs as well, but UEVal is a simply way to test the water.  We're meeting soon to discuss further.  

    John & Dan cc'd so they can add to this thread if they wish.
