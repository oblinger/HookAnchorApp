    - outline of my plans
      * Shopping my pitch ideas around:
        Community trips.  Boston. Bay area.  Maybe an invites only workshop.
      * Finding technical SETA
      * Seedling effort
      * Writing the first pitch
      * Writing proposal for U Maryland funding


    SETA STRUCTURING
    - Job posting.  can begin hiring process during first 90 days?  
      - Getting DARPA/TONY centric advising


    BAA/PIP preparing
    - get many examples of successful pitches
    - parts of a BAA



    SEEDLING EFFORT
    - Remind Barbara of ladders; multiple-modalities; facile representation
    - Ladders, Modality APIs, Exhaustive list of learning required for a realistic ladder
    - Scope complexity of: ladder building; background K building; and building learning system
    - Strawman Facile Representation proposal:  Researchers in required subareas need to see rough image of whole picture, so they see their work applies.
      (want support in retrieving background material)
    - Fund part-time senior researcher plus graduate student


    WHAT ELSE?
    - other training
    - other people to talk with
