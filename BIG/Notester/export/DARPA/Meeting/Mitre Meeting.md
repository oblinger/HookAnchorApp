    xxx,

    I believe you were going to check on the status of
    an outstanding request to obtain several pieces of
    software for my system.  Did you have a chance to check
    on this?

    Also I would be happy to be using individual pieces of
    that software as it becomes available.  Let me know if
    there are any peices that have been cleared.

    Thanks,
    Dan
