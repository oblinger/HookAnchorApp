# Ibm.8bCDP --

    >>> PERSONAL GOALS AND DEVELOPMENT NEEDS  (career; 8) 
    My primary goal for this past and the comming year is to quickly gain experience in those 
    aspects of the corporate world that differ from the academic world.  This includes: 
    * Working with customers and other developers to arrive at an effective project specification. 
    * The project development, delivery, and transfer cycle. 
    * Patent writing. 
    * The art of obtaining funding, initiating joint projects, etc. 
     
     
    >>> GROWTH PLANS  (special assignments & education; 8) 
    To gain experience in the activities described above by doing them. 
    (In one way or another, the tasks described in this CDP touch on each of these  
    areas, my goal is to broaden this exposure.) 
     
    To gain experience with commercial software languages, development environments, APIs, etc.  
    to complement experience aquired in the academic world. 
     
     
    >>> PERSONAL GROWTH PLAN REVIEW  (summarize last year; 7) 
    * Gained experience with many aspects of project management, through my work on a relatively 
      small (one-person) project.  Went through the design process with its customer, 
      and am in the process of finishing the initial deployment of this system. 
     
    * Gained a proficiency with the Java programming language, and a working understanding 
      of Java GUI development (the Java AWT). 
     
    * Gained experience with relevant tools and APIs: Install shield, the Voice Type Dictation 
      API, software development environments, etc. 
     
    >>> CAREER PLANNING SUMMARY (fut dir: outside resrch, in<<>>out field, in mgmt;9) 
    My short term goals (on the one to three year horizon) include: 
     
    * To capitalize on my Data Mining experience to integrate automatic modeling into  
      existing or new IBM applications whenever appropriate and useful to do so. 
     
    * To build ties with relevant groups and people throughout IBM research.  (The goal 
      is to build a few ties that are strong enough to support significant collaboration and 
      expertise sharing.) 
     
    * To serve as a technical project lead for prototypes deployed by IBM research. 
     
    >>> PROJECT<<>>BUISNESS OBJECTIVES (14) 
    My primary task for this review period was to develop a visualization tool for display and  
    analysis of student performance data while using Watch-Me-Read. 
     
    Other tasks include the resolution of specific problems within the current Watch-Me-Read  
    application, and the extension of the Watch-Me-Read base application for possible follow  
    on uses. 
     
    >>> RESULTS (19) 
    * Designed and implemented a sophisticated, highly-configurable, Java diagnostics application 
      for analysis of student-reading-performance data.  Related sub-tasks: 
      - Implemented a "classroom-centric" prototype of the diagnostics application. 
      - Presented this prototype to teachers and researchers from the Houston school district 
      - As a consequence of these meeting I redesigned the tool to be word and student centered. 
      - Implemented the diagnostics tool. 
      - Spent a week in Houston on initial testing an user feedback, a second testing is planned 
        for 11<<>>30, with a final roll out to eight schools within the district in Januaray. 
     
    * Identified a low-level driver incompatiblity between certain PC video drivers 
      and Watch-Me-Read.  Built a simple patch installation batch file to fix this problem. 
     
    * Resolved a conflict between Watch-Me-Read and Kid Desk, a popular application used to 
      launch Watch-Me-Read. 
     
    * Extended Watch-Me-Read's sprite-based animation module to allow multiple overlapping 
      foreground objects to be updated over top a scrolling background image. 
      (This extension is required for reading-pace tutors where reading proficiency translates 
      to progress in an on-screen race.) 
     
     
    >>> PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES (14) 
    * Build new relationships that either serve as a web of expertise, as a source of 
      projects or as collaborators (particularly within IBM). 
     
    * Maintain an active role withing the Data Mining <<>> Machine Learning community. 
     
    * Serve as a representative of the education group both in and out of research. 
     
     
    >>> RESULTS (18) 
    Though limited by current time constraints, I have maintained contact with the Learning  
    community through: 
    * Attendance at the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conference, and a series of 
      related statistics workshops. 
    * Maintained active contact with a small group of Data Mining researchers outside IBM Research, 
      through roughly bi-monthly discussion of current papers and work in the field. 
    * Discussed collaboration with the text Mining group Almaden research, and attended the  
      knowlege management seminars here at Watson. 
     
    Contributed to the education group through several supporting roles: 
    * Hosted Mary Mark, a potential candidate for hire. 
    * Presented for students through Watson's Local Education Outreach Program. 
    * Provided demonstrations at the Industry Solutions Lab. and other locations. 
     
     
    >>> TEAM OBJECTIVES (14) 
    * Work with others within the education group to develop and deliver prototypes. 
     
    * Collaborate with IBM global services, education researchers and teachers of the  
      Houston School District on the development of the WMR diagnostic tool. 
     
    * Explore new directions and possible collaborations for myself and our group. 
     
     
    >>> RESULTS (18) 
    * Developed an initial prototype of diagnostics tool, and used 
      this as initial starting points for multi-day discussions with teachers,  
      administrators, and researchers from the houston school district. 
     
    * Through these discussions, others discussion here in the lab, and a second week-long visit 
      to Houston we were able to arrive at a single overall architecture for the tool that  
      simultaneously meets specifications from a number of disperate and potentially  
      contradictory sources including: Don Nix, Diane Wiggins, a number of first grade 
      teachers, and an education researchers from the Houston School District. 
     
    * Currently investigating web-related document indexing (a potential direction for  
      future work within our group) through a number of avenues including: 
      - Possible patent generation. 
      - Exploratory meetings with Encylopedia (an organization with document indexing needs). 
      - On going discussions with the Bob Mack's information retrieval group here at Watson, 
        and the Text-Mining group at Almaden. 
      - Both the discussions with Encylopedia Britannica, and the text-mining group have both 
        yielded concrete proposals for collaborative work.
