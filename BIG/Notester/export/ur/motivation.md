    [MOTIVATION]

    * Computers already can learn better than us (consider DNF over 1000 vars)
    * We beat computers because we
      (1) map to existing knowledge, and
      (2) Learn complex things thru a long sequence of mini-learning problems (Knowlege acquisition)

    OUR GOAL -- Build a universal representation mapping engine
    * It can 'notice' when an input maps (rather directly) onto an understood structure
    * It can represent new input as an extension of a previously understood structure
    * It can perform simple generalization and inference operations in a very controlled fashion
      (Complex inference and generalization will only occur after it has learned thru many
       small lessions when and where such extended inference and generalization is fruitful.)
    * It can create arbitrary symbolic structure thru a potentially long sequence
      of incremental/generalization operations
    * Once it has found a more appropriate representation for a situation it will do future
      thinking using that new representation
