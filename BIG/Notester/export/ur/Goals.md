    Measurable Objective #1
    -----------------------

    System is presented with staged examples consistent with some arbitrary
    structure, and the system acquires that struture.

    (A) STAGED EXAMPLES are examples that are ordered in a way that assists
        the acquisition of the underlying structure.  (We are allowed to 
        "cheat" in the order and design of the examples.)

    (B) The ARBITRARY STRUCTURE is some special case ontology and associated
        inference methods.  System should work with any instance from some
        large class of possible structures.  An Example might be inference 
        over human family relationships.

    (C) Measuring whether the has system ACQUIRED A STRUCTURE might be done by
        (1) Lookoing at its datastructures
        (2) Letting is predict valid vs. invalid examples
        (3) Querying system about inferences that cannot be deduced from 
            observed examples, but can only be inferred from the fully
            general underlying structure.

    (D) We can cheat by giving system underlying structure, system must
        only recognize that the examples are an instance of that structure.
        So system might have a ontology for trees, along with interence mechanisms
        for trees.  Then the example above would be a matter of recognizing
        that family relationships was based on a tree representation.
