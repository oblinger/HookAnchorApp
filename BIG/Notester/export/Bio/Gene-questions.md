# Bio.Gene-questions --

    New Questions you 
    - would it help to find small predictive subset of genes 
      - Perhaps to build cheap gene arrays 
    - On cancer data are false-pos and false neg-equal 
     
     
     
     
     
    - clustering unknown genes 
    - predict gene categories 
    - finding gene coorelates 
     
    - identify when genes are sensitive to columns??
