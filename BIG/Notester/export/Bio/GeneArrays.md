    huntings? 
    do we have the graph 
    bio related metric for  
     
    1500 - 2000 <-- in paths 
    2500        <--  
    6000

    GOALS: 
    >>> Give labelled training data find best classifier for an unlabelled G-array. 
      - Max margin seperator  (SVM) 
      - feature selection methods 
      (Read their paper) 
     
    ? Get *labelled* training set        (**) 
      Why are values missing  
     
    >>> Data set normalization 
    ? How many dataset can we get 
    ? missing  values 
     
     
     
    >>> Which genes are related? 
      Tests:  Compare score of known relates against background  (z-scores) 
      Step1:  eye ball relationships between known relates 
     
    >>> What kind of relationships will we find in healthy cell?         (**) 
    ? are there papers that look at this 
    ? Do you have example of known cycle  (and datasets with those genes) 
    ? Do you have an exaple of broken cycle  
     
     
     
     
     
     
       
                                    
     
    - What is the distribution on features? 
     
    - Properties across sites? 
      a1 < b1  ==>  a2 < b2 
     
    - Conditions for constant sum? 
     
     
    <<>> 
    - Give me a concrete example of a single cycle. 
    - How many arrays from a single disease do I get? 
      (Do I have enough to find pairs of proteins involved in a disease?)
