    > - Sought domain w difficult K to test PI
      - Chose prediction of protein structure.
    > About proteins
      - All known life is constructed from proteins.
      - Remarkable building blocks are constructed from from a linear sequence
        of amino acids.  20 acids (represented by an alpha letter)
        Any protein can be described as a long string of alpha characters (pri seq)
        3-space coords is its structure.
      - Understanding fn is necessary for control
      - Fn completely determined by placement (structure)
      - Structure is completely determined by (sequence)
      - In principle, all info about a prot can be inferred from primary seq.
        (we will see that in practice this is far from true)
    > - Recently developed semi-automated techniques have been
        very successful in determining the composition (pri seq) of many
        proteins.  Result: Lg. Machine readable Online collections of K about prot.
      - In 1995 the first indep. organism was determined.
        When the influenza virus ... it introduced 17xx new proteins.
        Within days biologists were trying to determine the fn of these new prots
      - This is done is by looking at prots w. known fn for ones
        highly homologous to unknown prots.  Def Homology.
        This can be effective since proteins 
        with very similar primary have the same general shape and often same fn.
      - The converse does not necessarily hold.  Proteins with similar shape and
        function may have different sequence.  Similar fn is hidden in proteins
        w. very different homologies. 
    > - This situation is so important & common, biologist have named it.
        Def Hidden homology problem.
    >   Because of its importance much work done on prob. of hidden homology
