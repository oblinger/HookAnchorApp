    > INTRODUCTION  Prob; Impt; Approach; Benefits  *Note pi-kb-intro::
      - Increasing reliance on KB systems.  (ref of real complex stuff)    
      - Interestingly,  the difficulty is often not stating what is known,
        but stating it w/o over stating.
      -  The difficulty is not getting K, but correctly encoding it. (ref?)
        [in particular encoding the interaction between K]
      - Example: Meeting vs. Christmas
      - PROBLEM: Encoding what is known w/o overcommitment & making use of it.
      - Lots of approaches model uncertainty. But reasoning becomes difficult&weak.
      - SOLUTION: Don't make predictions from K alone.
        Treat ambiguity in K. as alternatives and use as the basis for
        strongly constrained induction.
      - This requires that our language for expressing uncertainty match
        type of uncertainty found in real world domain expertise.
      - We consider a range of both new and well-studied expertise
      - We construct a framework for using this uncertain K. as a bias for ind.
      - BENEFIT:
        + Permits reps w. that make weaker commitments and are still useful
          because ind fill in missing information.  Allow incorp of ambig. Exprt K.
        + Much of the complexity of the induced concept can be encoded in
          the experts space, leaving an small and managable space for induction.
