    changes to the same documents since I received my copy of them:

    This system is an adaptive retrieval system like ours, and it uses a 
    vector of document and query features to drive the retrieval process 
    also like we do.  Our approach, however, also utilizes context features 
    for both the current environment and the objects being retrieved in  
    addition to features about the docuemnts themselves.
