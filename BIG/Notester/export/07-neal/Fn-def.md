# 07-neal.Fn-def --

    For the purpose of this patent application we will use the terms rule and 
    function interchangeably.  Both refer to any data structure that can 
    be executed by an interpreter in a way as to compute a set of labeled output 
    values given a set of labeled input values.  An example of an arithmetic 
    rule is "Fahrenheit <- Centigrade * 5/9 + 32".  Rule languages include but are  
    not limited to: neural nets, decision trees, functional languages, polynomial 
    functions.
