    - GOALS:  (1) get more work<<>>fun done by being diligent and focused. 
              (2) get heart beat of work done in each important area by doing a min amt of work
                  on each.
    - APPROACH:
      - Most work days are 'STD' days.  others are a WASTE or, SPECIAL PROJ days.

    DEPRESSION MITIGATION PROTOCOL
    ==============================

    The idea here is to avoid the mental tail spin that occurs with no direction in case where emotionally
    I am in a weak spot.  Each day I should be (1) taking care of buisness, (2) getting work done, (3) making progress. 
    Each day should combine those three activities.
