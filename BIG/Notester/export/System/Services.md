# System.Services --



    Used to be 'started' & 'automatic'    I executed 'stop' and changed to 'manual'

    SVCHOST   
      'Computer Browser'            Maintains updated list of computers on network
      'Distributed Link Tracking'   Keeps track of short cuts across NTFS filesystems
      'Error Reporting Service'     Sends junk to microsoft

      'Net Location Awareness'      (This was already set to manual; but was started ??)
    ? 'Server'
    ? 'Smart Card'  
      'TCP/IP Net Bios Helper'      Allows Net bios booting and such.                


    SpySweeper                      Still eating up huge resources

    CcmExec                         Really only needed occasionally




    STEngine.exe    SenForce.       Huge resource drain given the very tiny service it provides.
