    Dan,
    There is only one next step required for you to activate your Golds
    membership.  When you first visit the gym on Wilson Blvd, have your
    personal credit card with you.  Golds will set up your account, charging
    your card $20 on the first of each month for membership.  I suggest you
    start with Dec 1, given the late date in November.

    Your membership allows for unlimited regional Golds usage.  To use a gym
    out of this area, you will need to request a Travel card from the local
    gym.  (I need to find out whether you can get a handful of these at
    once, or whether you can only get one at a time.)  Your membership
    provides you with up to 14 visits per gym location outside of our local
    area, per calendar year.  After
    14 visits to each out-of-area facility, you will be charged a guest fee,
    which is typically 50% of the regular visitor charge.

    Recommended next step:  Go to the local Golds with credit card in hand;
    get as many Travel cards as they'll give you.  You should be set locally
    and have as much out-of-area access as they'll give you at one time.

    Let me know if you have any other questions!
    Terrie
