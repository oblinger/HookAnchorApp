    Sara,  
     
    Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I just needed a spare 
    afternoon to put this description together.  Let me know if this is 
    what you were looking for, and feel free to provide my contact 
    information to the institute if they have further questions. 
     
    Thanks, Dan

    Below is a brief description of the Watch-Me!-Read reading practice 
    tutor.  It has been under development for over two years at IBM Research. 
    The application has been in continuous use in a number of beta-testing 
    sites now for over a year, and we are now interested in placing this 
    application into the consumer, education, and special needs markets. 
     
     
    DESCRIPTION OF WATCH-ME-READ 
     
    Watch-Me!-Read (WMR) is a reading practice tutor for beginning readers. 
    WMR uses a combination of recorded speech and speech recognition 
    assist a student in the reading of books in it repertoire. 
     
    Features: 
     
    * A speaker-independent voice model built using data 
      collected from over 1,800 children and adults taken with a diverse 
      set of dialects collect from over 16 cities throughout the United 
      States.  This speaker-independent model yields a 95% recognition 
      accuracy. 
     
    * Immediate feedback and assistance on reading performance. 
     
    * A natural and engaging interface based around collaborative reading 
      between the student and the panda companion. 
     
    * System accommodates a wide range of reading abilities: at one extreme 
      the companion only asks the student to repeat words of the story 
      after they have been spoken by the panda.  At the other extreme, the 
      student is reading the entire story. 
     
    * The degree of assistance offered by the panda is controlled by a 
      dynamically updated model of the student's competence on the current 
      reading material. 
     
    * Natural visual and auditory cue's are used to guide the interaction 
      with the student.  For example, the panda will walk over to a group 
      of words to be read, then say "Now you read this part."  He will cup 
      his ear as if to hear the student, and the words to be read will turn 
      red in color, and all other on the page will fade into the 
      background (become light gray). 
     
    * System can optionally accept input from a small camera, and the 
      student can display their reading of a book to parents and teacher. 
      This "show" will follow their reading of the book with synchronized 
      video and audio recorded as they originally read the book. 
     
    * Statistics taken during the use of WMR can be visually summarized 
      to provide a quick view of a students progress over time, and current  
      reading difficulties. 
     
     
    POSSIBLE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS 
     
    IBM's primary objective with respect to WMR is visibility in the 
    education and special needs markets.  We are also hope to promote the 
    sale and wide distribution of IBM's speech technology. 
     
    Thus we are seeking a partners for the sales, distribution, and support of 
    the WMR application.  WMR requires licensing of content (books) from 
    publishers.  The licensing of this content and conversion into WMR 
    would probably also be done by our partners, though other arrangements 
    may also be possible. 
     
    The cost of the IBM speech engine, and any licensing for the content 
    (books) provided with the system would have to be built into the cost 
    of the product.  Since visibility is our primary objective for WMR, 
    revenue (licenses, etc.) from the WMR application itself is of less 
    importance for us.  We believe that all of these costs can be borne by 
    a competitively priced product.  (Discounts on IBM's speech technology 
    may also apply for some special needs applications of the WMR system.) 
     
    Please do not hesitate to contact me regarding Watch-Me-Read.  And if 
    there is interest in pursuing an arrangement regarding Watch-Me-Read 
    we can send a version for demonstration.  Thanks for your time.
