    Live an aware life.

    - Meditate in the beginning of the day.
    - Align planned actions with deepest motivations.
    - Monitor motivation/thinking as I work.
    - Meditate again as second part of day begins.
    - Consider your day and the next day @ the end of your work day.

    - Align actions and thinking with spirituality.

    - Live with space in your life -- subtract, dont add.
