# Habits.Three\_Habits --


    - If minimum hit for all three habits on the day before I place an X in my food diary

    (1) Efficiency -- morning bounce
    (2) Health -- 


    === IDEA ===
    - Drive self with repeated successes, and with momentum.
    - Each day I have three (later four) goals that I try to accomplish, 
      when I do I put an X on my calendar.
    - Each goal should have an 'ideal' achievement, and a 'minimum' achievement
      if I make the minimum acheivement on all three goals, then I get to put an X on that day.
