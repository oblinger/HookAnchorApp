    === REVISED MOTIVATION & THINKING ===
    - Getting a positive start on the day, helps the rest of the day
    - Building a set of habits that hook together provide a set of automatic behaviors that are
      helpful, and over time require less effort since they are simply the automatic actions
      at each stage.
    - Less focus on the exact amount of time each activity takes, +/- 15 or even 30 min is less
      important than long term maintanance of good habits, and often there are good reasons if 
      timing is off
    - Goal is to have multiple interlocking habits, so it is possible to 'get back into the groove'
      by jumping into a sequence, even if in an altered way.  Still all the module habits kick in
    - Goal is to have a micro-sequencing that allows activities w. less thought since each activity 
      can be done as much as possible on auto pilot.
