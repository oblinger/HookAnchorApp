# Habits.Commit Capsule --


     <<>>

    MY COMMITMENT
    - On 8/20/2008 I commit to starting each "working day" with a COMMIT CAPSULE.
    - I commit to executing the tasks of the day with the degree of lattitude 
      and certainty committed to that morning.

    THE COMMIT CAPSULE
    (1) Immediately upon working, I execute a commit capsule.
    (2) At the beginning of this, I look at the clock.
    (3) By the end of this capsule I will have scanned for emergencies & made 
        my plan for the day.
        - Generally this will include rough estimation for the amount of time 
          given to each task or type of task.
        - It may also include the times I will begin/end admin and begin/end 
          quad2 block.    (as of 9/2008)

    ===TOPICS===
    DIVERSIONS     - Generally try not to get diverted during these first periods.  If diverted,
                     try to 'pause' clock; short diversions are just absorbed into admin period.
    OTHER STUFF    - If I start work with "other" stuff on my plate, generally try to push stuff to 
                     period immediately after quad2, but can decide to do other stuff first, can 
                     decide any other lengths of time for both blocks, 
    DEFFERED START - DANGEROUS!  Can defer capsule, should plan time for capsule
    OTHER FIRST    - DANGEROUS!  After capsule, other started first.  pick time limit!
    BLOCK SIZES    - Generally admin block is 30 or 120 min, and Q2 is 120 min.  But can decide anything in Capsule.
    PLANNING       - Generally try to have Quad2 'goals' lined up so I can work on them, but can 
                     also use Q2 time for planning.

    ==========
    MOTIVATION
    - My days are often burdened by a non-stop feeling of details to deal with.
    - I often do not get to the important tasks of the day.
