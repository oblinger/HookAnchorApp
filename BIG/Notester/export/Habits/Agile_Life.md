    MORNING-MISSION
    (!) MOVING   --  Fast right as you wake
    (2) MISSION  --  Write spec for the MISSION portion of the day.
                     Must have easily measured success criteria (time or task based)
    (3) MILESTONE -- measure accomplishments at SIX hour mileston after waking
                     Goal is to achieve mission by milestone point.  allowed to work past milestone.
                     Also allowed to reduce goals if (1) task was too hard, or (2) you blew it today.  
                     Just be explicit.

    MONDAY-MAINTANCE
    - Monday pick three.
    - Consider last week & your larger goals.
    - HotSpots -- Consider areas of pain <<>> no progress:
      Mind, Body, Spirit, Career, Fin, Relationships, Fun


    ORGANIZING IDEAS
    - WORST THINGS FIRST   -- Do most painful things first
    - POWER HOURS          -- Find periods where focus is high & use then in turbo mode
    - USE STRENGTHS        -- Consider strengths & try to maximize time&value I get from strengths
    - BE AWARE

    <<>>


    OTHER IDEAS
    - VISUALIZE PERFECT DAY-- not because will come true, instead understand what a simple day means to you. 
    - FOCUS
      - CARVE 'un-distracted' time
      - LIMIT TASKS 1-3 in start of day
      - SAY "NO" TO TASKS             -- 
      - SLOW DOWN 
      - CREATE SPACE                  -- Leave space between things.  don't cram.
      - MINDFULLY SINGLE-TASK
    - SMALL TASKS
      - Dont let them eat bigger <<>> important ones
      - Do them later in day
      - Batch them

    MONDAY-MAINTANCE (Motivation)
    - FIRE CHECK -- We strive to be working 'on fire' or at least 'motivated'
      most of the time.  When we are NOT feeling this way, something is wrong.
    - IF FIRE IS LOW -- Try to understand thoughts and emotions.  Plan solution:
      -- Understand problem
      -- Remove <<>> Change goal
      -- Grind thru it (at times of maximal strengh)
      -- ??
