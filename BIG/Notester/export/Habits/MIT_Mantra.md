    === Most Important Task ===

    (1) MIT list is maintained with a section at the top where ANY task listed would be
        an acceptable MIT for the day  (Monday thru Friday)
    (2) - Commit to the MIT for the day, first thing when opening the computer.
        - Commit to result, Commit to minimum time spent
        - Set 90 min timer (or whatever start time is)
    (3) === JUST STOP IN YOUR TRACKS AND DO TASK ===
    (4) There is NO backup if you fail your task, by the time you sleep that night.
        Your number of consecutive days simply goes back to ZERO (your fuck head.)
        (Exception is made if blocked by action out of your control)


    - DECIDE: Gonna do this on every weekday
    - 









    === THINKNG ===

    - Even when getting many things done, I can indefinitely avoid key activities.
      ==> Ensure I do at least some work on one MIT each weekday.
    - When committing to an activity I can really generate alot of stress guilt by 
      feeling like I should be working on it, but then not actually working on it.
      ==>  Have special time, procedures that make starting automatic
    - Needs to be a bit flexible since it is done each day.
