    From Steve: 
     
    Colleagues, I would like to schedule a 6 month review of your AR 
    project by the AR team during the last 2 weeks in November.  Your 
    prepared presentation should include (1) a fairly detailed technical 
    review of your progress to date, (2) a technical plan for the next 12 
    months including technical objectives and challenges and key 
    milestones, (3) a plan for external impact and interactions, 
    e.g. publications, presentations, joint work with universities, 
    standards activities and (4) issues impeding progress, e.g. staffing, 
    lack of management support. The duration of the review will be 90 
    minutes including time for questions. Bernadette will schedule 
    it. Please let me know if you have any questions. 
     
    Bernadette, the managers of the project members who are copied on the 
    note are invited to attend, but their attendance is optional.  Larry, 
    I did not include your management chain since you have not yet 
    formally begun working on the project.  Steve 
     
     
    FROM STEVE: The progress you have made is satisfactory as is the 
    choice of the Linux console as the initial platform to 
    implement. Installation/configuration of a Linux application is ok as 
    a general scenario, but we would like you to be specific about the 
    initial application or applications you will demonstrate. While you 
    mention the Lotus Sametime client, you don't say that you will 
    definitely do it. The following comments from Marc also pertain to the 
    choice of applications. 
     
    The Linux console seems by far the simplest of the choices they 
    explored - that's good. But - I'm concerned that real Linux 
    config. involves an interplay of console commands, editor manipulation 
    of configuration files, and, in many modern Linux systems, X-windows 
    based gui configuration interfaces.  But they may as well start 
    somewhere. 
     
    If you need to do further exploratory work before deciding on the 
    initial application(s) that is ok, but we would like you to have made 
    the choice by the 6 month review. Also, we expect to hear about any 
    progress you have made on exploring the instrumentation of the Windows 
    desktop at the 6 month review. 
     
    Steve
