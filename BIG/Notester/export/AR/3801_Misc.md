# AR.3801\_Misc --




    ---
    Colleagues, I would like to schedule the 12 month review of your AR project by the AR team in June, preferably in the first two weeks. Your presentation should include 

    A brief review of the status of your project at the last review
    A fairly detailed technical review of your progress since the last review including progress on the milestones you established at the last review   


    A summary of patent activity, publications, presentations, joint work with universities, standards activities since the last review 

    A technical plan for the next 12 months including technical objectives and key milestones

    A plan for external impact and interactions, e.g. publications, presentations, joint work with universities, standards activities

    Problems/issues impeding progress

    The duration of the review will be 2 hours including time for questions. Bernadette will schedule it. Please let me know if you have any questions.
    Steve
