    Abstract:
    We present an approach to learning procedural knowledge by demonstration
    called simultaneous alignment and generalization.  Key to our
    approach is the ability to induce complex procedure structure (loops and
    conditional branches) by aligning multiple unannotated demonstrations of
    the procedure's execution.  We present an implemented instance of a
    simultaneous alignment and generalization algorithm that relies on the
    known Input-Output Hidden Markov Models, and we describe an extension, the
    SimIOHMM,  that significantly improves the algorithm's performance.
    Our empirical evaluation demonstrates our system's scaling performance and
    quantifies the performance increase obtained through the use of the
    SimIOHMM extension.
