# AR.Rational\_Visit\_Blurb --

    Members from the IBM Research "Personal Wizards" project will be in Lexington sometime in the next couple of weeks.  They are working on  a technology for capturing and playing back complex procedures for Eclipse based applications.  The end user is presented with a "MP3 player" metaphor, where a procedure can be selected, played or paused.  While other technologies exist that can perform the playback, personal wizards adds three key benefits:

    The ability to create complex generalized procedures automatically from recorded expert demonstrations
    The ability to create and maintain these procedures without programming
    The wizard execution is robust to user interventions and to changes in the underlying application GUI

    These procedures are substantially more robust than simple macros, and they are inexpensive to maintain.  Potential applications include user training, product evaluations, scenario-based product help and others.  Attached is an illustration slide.

    There are two purposes for the visit:

    To establish a community of interest within Rational
    To identify a specific Rational tool <<>> user community that can serve as a first test case for this technology.

    Please let me know if you would like to see a demonstration and participate in a "roundtable discussion".  Also, let me know if you have a concrete usage scenario and would be willing to work with this team.   The bandwidth they would require from the identified group would be small, and the benefits to that group would be an exploration of Personal Wizards specialized to their particular application.
