    HERE IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PERSONAL WIZARDS TECHNOILOGY

    The "Personal Wizards" team at IBM Research is working on  a technology for capturing and playing back complex procedures for Eclipse based applications.  The end user is presented with a "MP3 player" metaphor, where a procedure can be selected, played or paused.  While other technologies exist that can perform the playback, personal wizards adds three key benefits:

    *  The ability to create complex generalized procedures automatically from recorded expert demonstrations
    *  The ability to create and maintain these procedures without programming
    *  The wizard execution is robust to user interventions and to changes in the underlying application GUI

    These procedures are substantially more robust than simple macros, and they are inexpensive to maintain.  Potential applications include user training, product evaluations, scenario-based product help and others.  Attached is an illustration slide.
