    We will be demonstrating our Doc Wizards prototype.  This system is used to author "follow me"
    documentation for eclipse-based applications.  We will demonstate the "follow me" technology
    where the DocWizard will interactively show and<<>>or follow a user as they execute a 
    complex procedure.  We will also show the recording of one of these executable
    scripts--recording a new script is accomplished by simply performing the task while 
    DocWizards is "watching"

    We believe this technology offers a low cost method for generating documentation, and we
    believe that "follow me" documentation has powerful advantages over traditional documentation as well.
    This technology will be of interest to groups requring:
      * Traditional documentation
      * Customer generated site-specific documentation
      * End-user automation <<>> customization
      * Authoring of training materials

    The primary aim of this trip is for us to identify a specific Rational tool <<>> user community that
    can serve as a first test case for our technology.  We are funded through 2005, so the goal
    here is to simply identify a potential product/user community for this technology.  During this coming year, we
    will then expand our technology in order to measure and demonstrate its utility for this specific
    user community.

    In this meeting we will be disclosing the Personal Wizards technology developed as part of a three year Adventurous research project.
    Personal Wizards employ machine learning techniques to induce the procedure that underlies a set of demonstrations of the procedure
    by a human interacting with a graphical user interface. Once this procedure is induced it can be used to automatically execute the 
    procedure directly on the GUI in the future.

    Abstract: Computer systems are commonly used to perform procedures.  For
    example, typical business process tasks include requesting travel
    reimbursement, procuring a new workstation, or managing the payroll.
    System-management administrators follow best practice procedures for tasks
    such as configuring and optimizing e-mail systems, and diagnosing and
    repairing network problems.  Finally, end users accumulate personal
    collections of procedures for accomplishing goals such as monitoring stock
    portfolios or collecting information for a presentation.

    The vision of the Personal Wizards project is to dynamically capture
    corporate and personal procedures in executable form through
    cross-application programming-by-demonstration.  The Personal Wizards
    system observes users performing procedures, captures keystrokes, mouse
    clicks, and
    system reactions, and abstracts semantically meaningful operations from
    these low-level observations.  The resulting traces are combined into an
    executable procedure representation that can guide a new user through a
    similar task, presenting the right information at the right time, and
    automatically executing steps in the procedure on behalf of the user.

    Current directions of investigation include: learning the structure of a
    procedure and generalizing individual steps from multiple traces created by
    different experts; creating human-understandable procedures; building
    executable procedures that are robust to noise and failures; providing a
    graphical representation of the learned procedure; allowing the user to
    collaborate with the system during the execution phase; and combining
    learning and execution.
