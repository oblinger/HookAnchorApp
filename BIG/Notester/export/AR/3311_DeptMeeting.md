    Title:     Personal Wizards:  Learning procedures by demonstration

    Speakers:  Dan Oblinger and Tessa Lau

    Abstract: 

    Procedural knowledge (collective knowledge on how to accomplish various tasks) represents a 
    significant asset for many organizations.  Our Adventurous research project called Personal 
    Wizards is focused on capturing and automatically synthesizing this knowledge into executable 
    procedures.  Our approach to this problem rests on a Windows "click stream" instrumentation 
    layer, alignment algorithms used in computational biology, as well as inductive learning 
    techniques.  We will discuss the approach as well as results to date.  We welcome discussion 
    of possible broader application of these techniques as well.




    - Motivation
      * Procedural K is impt,  Semi-auto capture & widespread disemination

    - LiveDocs

    - Basic approach

    - Reserach Challenges

      - Getting the data
      - Abstracting the data
      - Aligning the data
      - Generalizing data
      - Collaborative management of proc data

    The Vision
    - Discuss dissemination; 80%  case wizard
    - Auto "you are here" functions
