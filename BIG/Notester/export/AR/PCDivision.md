# AR.PCDivision --

    At the Tivoli presentation, Tushar identified a contact in PCD/ThinkVantage (Personal Computing Division? the people who make the Thinkpads) who might be interested in using our system to automate common PC tasks.  I wrote down the contact's name as Steve Welch at Almaden, with a note saying that when we contact Steve, we should say that Tushar referred us.

    Larry, you mentioned that you were willing to pick up an external contact job --- are you interested in this one?  Otherwise, I'm happy to pick this up after I get back from vacation.



     PCD - Think Vantage  Steve Welch  might fit for think vantage.
