    - weight vector (distribution over weight vector)


    - learn prior on coverage matix 
    - meta features on features (rows <<>> cols)


    ----------------------   (Empirical bayes)
    - k-tasks
    - NB- k times
    - k weight n-dim vectors
    = mean n-vector
    - covar nxn matrix 


    ----------------
    - k+1 task
    - new data
    - logistic regression
