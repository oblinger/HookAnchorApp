    Respond to NIST


    All at NIST:

    I wanted to update you on my progress.  I will be pitching a Machine Reading program the first week in April, and will
    let you know how it goes.  I continue to feel that NIST has much to contribute to the long term potential for this work.
    I did hit some snags in my briefing of this material at the IPTO level.


    All in the room felt that it was prudent for me to not link this proposal explictily to NIST in anyway.
    Evidently their were some issues having the bandwidth to support the retest on the Gail program.  I don't know the details
    on this, so please dont take that as any kind of issue from me.  But it was what started the discussion about why I
    would want to complicate a straightforward open bidding with a significantly sized non-bidded evaluation portion.


    I am following that advise, and not mentioning NIST at my new start briefing, but I have not changed my core belief that
    a government agency like NIST is the best partner for providing long-term continuity for an effort like this.  So once (if) 
    we have permission to release a BAA, we will revisit discussions about how to proceed.  

    Just wanted to keep you guys in the loop.  Thanks much for hospitality when I visited.

    Cheers, 
    Dan
