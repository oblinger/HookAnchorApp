    refund from register fly  

    On 2/42008   499 899 1039 1039 1039 1538

    <<>>


    SUMMARY:  I was charged multiple times for services I did not receive by register fly.
              They are not responsive.  What email/phone do I use to get a refund?


    I was charged the following amounts on 2/4/2008
       $4.99 $8.99 $10.39 $10.39 $10.39 $15.38

    I was never able to get customer support to respond to my requests, I never had the DNS entry active, 
    I waited the 60 days and then transferred to different service.  

    I did not want to ask for a full refund while you controlled my address, but now that I you no longer control that 
    address, I would like a full refund, as I was never able to use your service.
