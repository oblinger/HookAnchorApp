    Dan, Tessa, Yolanda and Mathias,

    Thank you for submitting a workshop proposal for AAAI05. We have 
    decided that
    your proposal looks excellent and we accept it for inclusion in the 
    workshop program.

    We will be providing the AAAI organization with the title of your 
    workshop and
    names of the organizers. They will be contacting you with details on
    procedures and schedules. In the meantime, we would like you to work on 
    your
    Call for Participation. AAAI would like to receive it by November 19 for
    inclusion in their advertising and web site.

    We are very excited about this year's workshop program, particularly in 
    that
    we think it has the potential to renew and/or strengthen ties between 
    AAAI and
    some of the related, more specialized conferences.  Specifically, 
    included in
    the program are several follow-up workshops to events that were 
    previously
    held at some of these other conferences.  We hope that by holding this 
    set of
    workshops at AAAI, some regular AAAI participants will take the 
    opportunity to
    join workshops that they otherwise might not have.  We also hope that 
    the
    workshops themselves will help attract a new set of people to AAAI to 
    discuss
    shared interests. We encourage you to set up your own website for your
    workshop where you can post further information and to advertise your 
    workshop
    within your specific community.

    Please let us know if there is any way in which we or AAAI can help 
    make your
    workshop a successful meeting.  We look forward to working with you.

    Adele & Peter
    AAAI-05 Workshop Co-Chairs
