    Almaden and Watson PIC chairs, most PICs have had funds approved for university visits this year. While preference is being given to a PIC's top 4 university departments (the current spreadsheet is attached below), others are OK if the PIC chair approves. As you know, the following are the requirements for these visits:

    Give a regularly scheduled department-wide or university-wide seminar, or regularly scheduled seminar at the research group level within a department
    Discuss with Research Campus Relationship Manager (CRM) prior to visit 
    Meet with students
    Prepare report on meetings with students and any meetings with faculty and send to CRM
     
    Please be proactive in making sure that these visits occur and that all the requirements are met. It is advisable to plan these visits far enough in advance so that the seminars can be included in regularly scheduled series. There is a renewed Research focus on university recruiting with the appointment of the CRMs and the PIC university visits are intended to help in recruiting. Attached below are the names of the current CRMs, whom I have copied on this note. Almost all the universities identified by at least one PIC as top 4 now have CRMs (Cal Tech and Princeton are among the few that do not). Please make sure that anyone who plans to make a university visit funded by your PIC discusses the visit as far ahead of time as possible with the CRM and sends a report on meetings with students and faculty to the CRM as soon as possible after they return. The CRM can help coordinate the multiple visits that may occur and may be able to help with getting seminars scheduled. The CRM should be able to provide useful information about the department(s) being visited, including the names of faculty and students with whom IBM Research has relationships and other visits by IBMers.
