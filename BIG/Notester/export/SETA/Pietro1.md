    ** BURST:   Not a burst mode guy.
    ** OWNERSHIP:
          "I will give it a try"
          Not an I own this and will get it come hell or high water
          Pass info thru, dont vet (slides)
          Not "On top of things" guy
         Tend to 'do your job' and 'do what you are told' rather than see that things are driven to ground, that the job gets done.
    ** DETAILS:  
         Somewhat of a details guy, but make fair number of mistakes
         fonts broken; pictures misaligned; info incorrect, etc.
    ** VISION:   
        - Not a forest for the trees guy.
        - Not cutting to the most important thing.
    ** NOT FAST:
        - 
    ** SLIDES:  Not a vision guy ; Not a layout guy ; Not a details guy

    Patty,

    I still think a sentence about analogical reasoning  belongs in the Summary, after all, it's in the title.  A put a variant back in, in a different place that may feel better.  I also tweaked some of your added words (I liked the added explanation, I just wanted to play with the words).

    It's OK as you had it and I won't be (permanently) offended if you ignore my proposed edits.

    -Focus 
     -Not good at vision.

    --------

    - Not able to operate in burst mode.
    - Not able to work fast:
      - Not able to identify and attack central issues.  Tend to work A-Z
      - Tend to attack all tasks straigh-on w/o looking for the shortcuts appropriate for time available.
        - forbus/cohen reviews, RFI materials, ...
      - Require thuroughness in order to work.
    - Do what I say, little productive creativity.
    - Not best at keeping track of details.  (But good at project mgt.)
    - What you are told.  Nothing above and beyond.
      - never explore to understand how DARPA works, never check something just to be sure
