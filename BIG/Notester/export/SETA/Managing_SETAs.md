    * LOOKING AT ME THRU YOUR EYES
      - Smart guy, heart in the right place BUT ....
      - Dont give credit where due, don't accurately understand amount of work accomplished
      - Assess your performance in reference to how I feel I would have done on same task.
        (which is both a high bar, and an unrealistic bar, since one is always generous is imagining how self 
         might perform in best of all circumstances.  then comparing that with one another did in actual circumstance)
      - Often negative, unrealistic expectations, 
      - High strung
      - Hit or miss. 
        Long periods where I am not looking at an issue, then hyper sensitivity to issue.

    ---------------------
    HOW HAPPENS<<>>WHY<<>>TO FIX

    * HIGH-FUNCTIONING ever improving 
      I aspire to be very high functioning & have a high functioning team.  
      (not what everybody aspires to it, but nothing wrong with this goal.)

    * VERY HIGH ENERGY <<>> VERY HIGH MOTIVATION:
      I HAVE IT:  also nothing wrong with it.  Indeed needed to achieve hi-functioning
      I EXPECT IT IN MY TEAM:  That is not appropriate.
      - May not have high energy, but can still be productive.
      - Not realistic to expect same motivation with different job positions.  Just not realistic.

    * CONSEQUENCE OF MY EXPECTATIONS.
      - Imagine delegating large chucks with little oversight, and since peer has same ability and motivation all works out.
      - Expect that minute to minute, and as the hours wear on, all around me will approximate my energy level, 
        motivation level, and desire for increased productivity.
      - Attempts to disengage
      - Frustration when others are not matching my energy level.
      - Frustration when others dont produce at the maximum level of their ability, rather produce something
        then see if it is "good enough" for to get by Dan
      - Frustration when others don't produce at maximum level of My perception of my ability.
      - Frustration when zero structure is provided, that others dont just take it upon themselves to invent
        that structure.  " after all, I have not structure around me, and I am inventing it.... why isn't everyone
        else doing that too?  "
      - Frustration when I percieve myself to be moving fast, and behind on tasks, only to find a team that seems
        to be cruising on some chatting conversation as if this stuff is not the most important thing to be working on.

      - I bite my tounge 20 times, each one getting more frustrated, and more convinced at failure of my expectations,
        more convince that things are not as they are ``supposed to be''
      - Finally I will snap at someone, or just be negative and high strung.

    * FIRST ANSWER:  Get over it DANNY.  
      - Expectations are misplaced, even you in a SETA role would not have the motivation you have in the PM role.
      - Moreover few people have your energy or motivation, and you can produce alot in an hour.
        GET OVER IT.  It is the wrong comparison to make.
      - Plus comparing your idealized performance against others actual performance is not accurate anyway.
      - AND trying to put such motivations on others from the outside will just result in feeling of being on a tread mill
            or grinded under the will of another.

    * INSTEAD:
      (1) Recognize the dramatic asymetry that is at play here:
          - This is not "THEIR BABY" like it is "YOUR BABY"
          - Different peoples, energy, extra life commitments, and basic abilities are just different.
            Don't pretend they are (or should by) wired like you.
      (2) Now within that context it is fine for aim at ever improving personal performance, and high performance within the group overall


    * CONCRETE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE GROUP
      - Don't expect others to have the   "I am gonna work whatever, whenever, and gonna push harder next time"  that's dan's job
      - Expect 40 hours per week, no more, no less:  If the job demands more hours one week, then less hours should be worked on a different week.
      - Collaborate to produce the structure that underlies highly effective work.  
        - Don't expect that it will happen by itself, then be frustrated when it does not.
        - Do institute habits that reinforce group structure
      - Connect back very frequently to understand progress 
        Don't be out of the loop for 30 hours of work, and then expect 30 hours of progress.
        it wont happen that way, you wont have accurate expectations, and you won't be sensitive to issues that limited progress
      - Don't expect high productivity all the time.  
        - Even with strong ability, very high energy, and very high motivation it doesn't always happen that way for me
          so why the hell should that be the baseline for others?!
     
      - Don't focus on productivity of the whole picture, rather focus on getting high productivity for some portion of every day.
        - Interact frequently but only on selected things, and understand progress based on product rather than process

      - Don't set artificial deadlines, or declare alotted require for tasks
        - Instead *ASK* on a frequent basis what the plan is, and understand how the plan is working.

      - Have lower expectations:  well within the range of reasonable, but hold team to those expectations week in and week out.
        - I will continue to do burst mode, well above the 40.... and I will be alone in that.
          (it is 2:20 am right now)


    * CHANGES TO THE WAY WE DO BUISNESS
      - Expectation:  40 hours week.
        Can be more or less as personal or work needs dictate.  In both cases we will compensate at a later time.
        - Getting in at similar times.
      - Working hard, but not on a tread mill.  
        - Solid structured progress every day, but significant chuck of unstructured time too.
        - THREE hours for email reading/responses, non-scheduled phone calls, 
                          bring lunch back, chatting in the hall, calling doctors, wife, tax consultant, web surfing, etc.
        - FIVE hours for major planned structured tasks.
          - ZERO unstructured activites during these focused hours.
          - tcons, group/planned meetings, producing slides/documents/performer schedules, etc.
        - Ratio should move toward 2/6 when little interaction with performers, but even with a crap load of interaction
          it generally should not go above 3 hours per day.  
          (NOTE:  Longer >45min unplanned tasks become part of the planned activities)
      - 5 minute meeting everyday
        - You tell me the plan; I listen.
        - ONLY discuss FIVE hour planned time, ZERO discussion of unstructured time.
        - List the key activities.
        - How yesterday's plan went.
        - ok if meeting devolves into larger planning prioritization meeting. (but often it will not if we are on a course)



    * DETAILS ABOUT THE MEETING
      - ZERO discussion of 

        - *ONLY* discuss 1-3 major tasks
        *** Important:  



    activities and guessed hours
      - Plan for 5 hours of structured activity 



     impeding progress accurate in assessing the progress anyway




      




    ast, and I come in only to find 




    Way I operate








    -------------------------------

    I am a type-A worker, that relishes any "anytime" schedule, I focus on max efficiency rather than schedule.  
    `(sometimes not an efficient strategy)
    It is not impt that those that work under me, match either my mode of work, or the level of work.
    But both as a custodian of taxpayer $$, and as a human I feel some fret, when I blow thru and feel that 
    my staff is operating in a hit or miss fashion.


    Best ways to manage:

      * Don't track either output produced, or time spent.  
        Rely on each person to keep a sense of focus and efficiency.
        -->  This approach must be part of a whole solution. 
          -->  But I don't feel great about it being the whole approach, I dont think it matches me, or results in urgency desired.
          -->  That said, 

    What can be added?

      * Don't pay attention to hours worked, just what is produced.
        -->  Difficult to assess how long something should take.

      * Break work up into smaller pieces, and set short deadlines for each.
        -->  somewhat time intensive
        -->  easier to assess how long it should take.  Keeps expectations reasonable.  Focuses work.

      * Focus on hours worked, and on efficiency while working.
        -->  Reliable, but time intensive, and feels invasive.

    ----
    - Set and Achieve deadlines.  Worked on plan for day/week each day/week.
    - TIME:
      - Be at work for longer than 8 hours to account for lapsed time
      - Dont count non-work time as part of day
      - Allocate certain time in day for chatting/surfing
    - Aim for
