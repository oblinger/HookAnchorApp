    Dan, A quick follow-up:  I spoke with a crypto expert and he believes
    that your GHOST ideas appear already in the crypto community.
    Specifically, in the context of voting, there is a substantial amount of
    work:

    <<>>
    See in particular work by Josh Benaloh (formerly J. Cohen), David Chaum,
    Sako/Killian.

    He also mentioned this paper:
       Tal Moran, Moni Naor: Receipt-Free Universally-Verifiable Voting
    with Everlasting Privacy. CRYPTO 2006: 373-392
    which has more recent references.

    He says that these ideas of antagonistic collaborators/time capsules/etc
    all appear.  He didn't know if they all appeared in one system, but that
    we should look at the extensive literature on the subject prior to
    pursuing more extensively.

    Is this similar to the feedback you received?

    Dan, I spoke with someone else about your ghost ideas -- he suggested
    talking to Ben Adida:
       <<>>
    who was Ron Rivest's PhD student.

    Ideally, he suggested talking to Ron, of course, but getting Ron's time
    is difficult and that Ben has been thinking about these issues..  There
    is a vast amount of literature in this subject..
