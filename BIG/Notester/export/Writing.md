    1. PAPER ORGANIZATION 
     
    1.1. GLOBAL STRUCTURE  (for paragraphs sections and papers) 
    Issue or the Introduction: 
    Use key words to announce principle actors. 
    Make a promise or significant claim. 
     
    <<>> 
    | Issue   : * |  Discussion                                 | 
    <<>> 
                ^ Can put key at end of issue, but it must be at 
                  emphasis point of sentence. 
     
     
    1.2 THE INTRODUCTION (Stating Problem) 
    1)  Setup Conflict 
          [the ideal<<>>belief<<>>expectation<<>>perception] BUT  
    2)  Cost<<>>Benefit<<>>Importance 
    3)  Focusing Question<<>>Task 
    4)  Purpose of paper <<>> Strategy taken by paper 
     
    FRIEND'S ADVICE: 
    Abstract should have one sentence for each of the following points. 
    Intro. should have a paragraph for each, plus paragraph with outline of paper. 
    1.  What the problem is. 
    2.  Why the problem is important 
    3.  How we will solve the problem 
    4.  In what way will this solution help the community 

    MY INTRODUCTION
    1)  Setup Conflict 
          [the ideal/belief/expectation/perception] BUT  
    2)  Our Approach
    3)  Benefits of approach
    4)  Outline -- Strategy taken by paper 

     
     
    2. WRITING SKILLS 
     
    2.1. PARAGRAPH LEVEL ORGANIZATION 
    Topic Sentence (first one or two sentences) must: 
        * Link to previous 
        * Summarize point of paragraph 
        * Should indicate organization of paragraph (standard types of organization) 
    End of Paragraph should link to topic sentences.  
            1) Chronological Description. Use: 
                First, Second, Third, Finally.   
                Verb tense, time adverbs and phrases. 
                Grammatical parallelism: e.g.  command-verb object.  command-verb object. 
            2) Cause and Effect Analysis.  Use: 
                Connectives:  therefore, thus, consequently, accordingly, as a result, so 
                Subordinate:  since, because (of), due to 
                Causal:          causes, results in, gives rise to , affects, requires, produces 
                Conditional:  when, where, given, if-then 
            3) Compare and Contrast.  List all benefits of one followed by benefits of the other. 
                Connectives:  however, on the other hand, conversely, similarly, likewise, in contrast to 
                Comparative: more than, -ER, than, less than, as ... as, rather than, is different from 
                Verb Tense:   Prog X will be easy to implement, where as Prog Y would entail complications 
                Subordinate:  while, whereas, but 
                Parallelism:   Model X is reliable and efficient, where as Model Y is unreliable ... 
            4) Lists.  Must cast in parallel grammatical form. 
            5) General to Particular 
     
     
    2.2. SENTENCE FLOW 
     
    Sentence Structure: 
    <<>> 
    | Old Info         ------>    New Info                         | 
    | Short/Simple                Long/Complex                     | 
    | Subject            Verb     Complement  (Stress point at end)| 
    <<>> 
    THREE REQUIREMENTS ON SENTENCE STRUCTURE (in order of importance). 
    1) Put given info. before new info. 
       Refer to previous using: full/short noun phrase, pronoun, related concept 
       Minimize use of synonyms, and related concepts refs unless obvious to reader 
    2) Put topical info. in Subject Position 
       Maintain topic thread through subjects 
    3) Put ``light'' before ``heavy'' noun phrases 
       Eg. Subject NP should be shorter than Object NP 
     
    Ways to satisfy these constraints: 
    a) Use passive to reorder sentence. 
    b) Break sentences. 
    c) Use short form refs. 
     
     
    2.3. EDITING 
    2.3.1. EDITING (paragraph level) 
     
    * Topic String Test -- do the subjects of the sentences of the paragraph 
      relate? 
     
    Emphasis 
    * Combine closely related sentences 
    * Use signal words: furthermore, etc. 
    * Be concise 
    * Use Physical Highlighting: font, size, bold, italics, underline, quotes, 
          bullets, paragraph breaks, commas, etc. 
          Must maintain globally consistent use of highlighting. 
     
    2.3.2. EDITING (sentence level) 
    *   Make crucial action or condition be the verb. 
    *   Remove nominializations. 
     
     
    3. GRAMMAR 
     
    To determine if ``*'' is an: 
    Adjective:    Say ``very * noun'' 
    Subject:      Who/What verb?    Answer: the subject. 
     
     
     
    4. SPEAKING TIPS 
     
    For academic talks. 
    - Don't assume background of area; but dont give formal background, give jist 
    - Define the core challenging problem addressed 
    - Spend time on your solution
