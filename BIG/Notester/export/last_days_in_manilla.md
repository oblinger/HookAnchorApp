# last\_days\_in\_manilla --




    I am in Manila for a few days at the end of my first trip thru the Philippines.
    It has been great (and exhausting). I had some dental work done, so I must
    come back beginning of next year... I am already looking forward.

    I saw your profile... educated, good job, and well cute too :-)
    I think it would be so nice to meet, but I have almost no time left! Maybe just
    a coffee or such during your lunch break or whatever works.

    Anyway, if you are interested in knowing more about me, write back, or better just
    text me at +639984374334 since I am only here for a bit more.

    really hoping to hear from you!
