# NH.embedded\_notes --

         Opened
      ends at first line with *less* indention
      ends at first link line with equal indention
      ends at blank line


    PROPOSAL
    - stuff upto first blank line is what is embedded from a note

    IMPL
    - parseEmbeddedEntries(text, fromIdx, indent, linkName) returns recursive list
      <<>>
    - saveEmbeddedEntries(parseTree)
    - expandEmbeddedEntries(noteNmae, indentLevel)  performs recursive expansion

    <<>>





    This is content at the same level
