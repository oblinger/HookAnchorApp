    ABSTRACT:
    Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS) is an intelligent reasoning
    system, where intelligence means working and adapting with
    insufficient knowledge and resources.
    NARS uses a new form of term logic, or an extended syllogism, in which
    several types of uncertainties can be represented and processed, and
    in which deduction, induction, abduction, and revision are carried out
    in a unified format. The system works in an asynchronously parallel
    way. The memory of the system is dynamically organized, and can also
    be interpreted as a network.
    After present the major components of the system, its implementation
    is briefly described. An example is used to show how the system works.
    The limitations of the system are also discussed.
