    - AAAI '92 Jimmy Crawford "Non-mon verses Qual reasoning"
    FOUNDATIONS
    * Show that influents transfer some randomly generated contexts.
    - Meaning of an influent in terms of illdefined predicates
    The idea is that the predicates get meaning from remainder of theory.
    NOTE: This def of meaning is non-compositional
    - Clausal rather than horn basis for influents.
    EMPIRICAL WORK
    * Implement a test generator for PIE and FOCL
    IN THE WINGS
    - Make commitments about commitments on plausible theorm confirmation
    - Choose a domain.
    - Think about statistics associted with plausible inference.
    - Proofs about imprecision == complexity of learning
    - Belief is related to the number of extentions admitted by the set of example
    - paper topic: knowledge transfer from one sub-domain to another (influents, Y
    - list properties associated with deductive concepts (like truth)
