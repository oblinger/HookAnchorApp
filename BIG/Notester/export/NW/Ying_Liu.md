    Currently, my research is focusing on the following topics, but I may
    keep exploring other interesting topics:

    Data Mining:
    propose novel mining models, design and implement high
    performance mining algorithm for large-scale databases

    Parallel Computing:
    design and implement parallel (on shared-memory or
    distributed memory environment) data mining algorithms

    Performance Evaluation:
    develop a data mining benchmarks including
    representive algorithms, evaluate their performance and characterize the
    kernels of computation

    Stream Mining:
    develop high performance frequent itemset mining
    algorithm(s) in realtime data streams
