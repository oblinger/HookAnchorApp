    ""
    "Dear Dr. Oblinger,
    During your visit to Northwestern this fall, I had expressed my interest for
    an internship for summer 2005. As a follow-up I am sending my resume with
    this email.
    Presently I am pursuing PhD in Computer Engineering at the ECE Department,
    Northwestern University, IL. I finished my MS from the same university in
    2003.
    My research interests are in the area VLSI CAD <<>> EDA in general and
    specifically in high level synthesis, CAD and architecture for low power
    FPGAs and reconfigurable computing. Presently I am involved in incorporating
    temperature awareness in high level synthesis with aim of reducing hotspots
    in future integrated circuits. I am also involved developing CAD  flow to
    create voltage scaling ready designs for FPGAs, and proposed new FPGA
    architectures with voltage islands.
    Last summer I did internship at Calypto Design Systems, Santa Clara, CA
    where I was involved in developing optimization passes for their Verilog to
    SystemC reverse synthesis tool CREST. I have excellent programming skills in
    C++/C and background in algorithms.
    I have attached my resume with this email and would appreciate any help in
    this regard. I look forward to hearing from you.
    Thanks
    Rajarshi
