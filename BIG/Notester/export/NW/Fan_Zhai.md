    Hi Dan,
      Thanks for your reply and future help. So far, the best match position
    in IBM I've found is in media delivery architecture department and the job
    id is K068316. If you also know somewhere else which also matches my
    background, that'll be great. Waiting for your email.

    Best,
    --Fan
