    Hi Dan,

    Sam Stupp us the only professor with whom I have a personal relationship. I've invited him to Watson to speak at a meeting that I will be hosting in October. I hope at that time to talk to him about helping me identifying top students at Northwestern.

    Looking at the links you sent, I would say that our Physical Sciences research interests do not overlap strongly with the interests of professors in Chemical and Biological Engineering. We do some polymer chemistry and so do they.  I noted that Prof. Hatzimanikatis does research in functional genomics, computational biology and bioinformatics -- perhaps of interest to researchers in our CBC under Ajay Royurru.

    We have better overlap with faculty interests in the Materials Science and Engineering Department. Although much of this work is aimed at biological materials or biomimetic systems, many of the faculty are interested in applying the knowledge outside of the realm of medicine and biology. Also many faculty are involved with materials research in inorganic systems of more immediate technical interest to IBM. 

    In any conversations with faculty, you should emphasize our interest in the very top students. Including both Almaden Research Center and Watson, we make only a few permanent or postdoctoral offers a year in materials science. 

    I hope this is of some help. I've asked a few of my managers to recommend specific faculty members at Northwestern. I'll send you any suggestions that I receive.
