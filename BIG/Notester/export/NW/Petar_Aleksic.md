    Hi Daniel,

    I interviewed (by telephone) Petar for a summer internship in 2003.    Petar Aleksic has substantial experience in lip tracking work in relation to his research in speech synthesis.

    However,  as I found another student who had substantial background in  video content analysis as required for my project,  I did not make an offer to Petar.
    Best wishes,
    Chitra
