    ** Not get hung
    ** Should embed in relevant languages (like Logic languages)
    - Less is more (very impt to clearly select a subset language)
      - want to identify a SMALLEST sufficient language so it is possible to generate it as OUTPUT of learning
        - need to learn instances of that language
      - want SIMPLE language so it can be efficient leveraged as INPUT to learning
        - carefully crafted to relation between stmts and hyp space searching exists.
    - Let everyone play together
      - some<<>>much of ai does not view Logic as the language of thought
      - want minimal assumptions <<>> min semantics base that embeds into each groups favorite rep of thought
      - Note:  if x embeds in y, it does not mean that the interesting meaning in X is well expressed in Y

    - Move fwd now, change to better language if we find it.  (typed logic of some sort?) 
    - Clean embedding into CYCL would be a good property
