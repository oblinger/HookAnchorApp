# SaaS Funnel --


    Plan

    - Figure out MVP for SaaS product

    - Build call prospects list by googling "SEO optomization" and BUISNESS_AREA
      (might try to uncover if they are using our requisite tech, or maybe not)

    - Make a few calls to reality check.

    - Build polished graphics to show during cold calls for what we deliver.

    - Make many calls trying to get a 'spec' contract for a single optomizers SaaS stack.
