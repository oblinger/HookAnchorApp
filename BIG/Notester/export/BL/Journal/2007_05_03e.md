    BL-FAQ

    Dan:

    I had some questions about your concern to involve algorithm specialists in BL.  the questions are:

    1.  What kind of algorithm specialist are you looking for?
    2.  How much effort are you imagining in this area?
    3.  Should they be members of the learner team?

    Here are my draft answers to these questions:

    I have been assuming that you want people with expertise in efficient theorem proving and constraint solving, with something of an emphasis on the former.  Is that view correct?  If so, people who have done a lot of work in applying TP methods to specific problems are:
    Kestrel Institute (various people)
    Brian Williams (MIT)
    People who have done more general work in the area include:
    Bart Selman
    Jon Doyle
    Are these the sort of guys you had in mind?

    I had assumed that you wanted a consulting effort, but am now thinking you want a more substantial contribution.

    In line with the shift in answer number two, I now think that you want the algorithm person(s) to be full fledged members of a learning team.

    Would you prefer to talk about this on the phone?

    If you would like to post answers to these questions on the BL web site, I wouldn't mind, but would prefer that you not use any of the names I listed above, since we have actually contacted most (but not all) for teaming possibilities.

    regards,
    Bob
