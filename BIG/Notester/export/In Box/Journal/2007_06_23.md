    Cheap Energy
    - Vital to Strategic, and National Security interests.
    - Vital to our way of life.
    - Has be a significant source of international conflict.
    - Its role in future conflicts like to worsen as world demand increases while supply decreases.


    Photo-voltaics today are like the transistor of the '70s
    - Well understood physics
    - Many orders of magnitude away from known fundamental limits


    Path to Solution
    - Like the transistor, the commercial interests will drive voltaic performance toward fundamental limits
      once thier performance competes with alternatives.  When invented transistors were close to parity with competing technologies.
    - Voltaics are further and thus require directed investment to overcome key barriers before commercial interests will take
      over the funding of their push toward fundamental limits of the technolgy


    The Key
    (1) Identify most promising paths to cheap voltaic energy
    (2) Identify technical challenges that are barriers to robust commercial investment
    (3) Build program around resolving those key unknown challenges


    and quantify most technologically challenging
