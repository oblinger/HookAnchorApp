    "Dan,

    I enjoyed meeting with you at AAAI.

    I have attached a paper on many-layered learning.  I have
    also attached a tech report and a recent slide that are
    related to my work on learning from reading textbooks.
    I will be working on a longer paper during August.

    I would like to find out more about your ideas for ladders
    of learning in different levels of representation.

    Paul
