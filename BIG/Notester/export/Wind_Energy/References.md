    Abstract
    Various aerodynamic platforms are considered for suitability for deriving electricity through wind turbines placed in the jet stream. Wind tunnel, economic, and performance analyses were performed for the integrated diffuser augmented wind turbine (IDAWT), the separated DAWT (SDAWT), a separated unshrouded wind turbine (SUWT), and a rotary wing concept (RWC). The wind tunnel trials were run with models and half models of the concepts to test the lift, static stability, and power extraction capability in a 25 m/sec flow. Variations in lift at varying angles of attack were also studied. The results indicated that the SDAWT and the IDAWT could be built at $650/kW and produce power at an operating cost of $.05/kWh. Improvements are projected to reduce the costs to $550/kW installed with operating costs less than $.04/kWh. The rotary wing concept was ruled out as a candidate.
