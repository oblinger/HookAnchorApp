    TITLE

      The last generation,  for real?!
      Free energy?  Free food?  Free clothing?

      Really?




    INTRO

    In every generation there are prophets of doom, profits of cataclysmic change, its the same old thing today.
    But today some of the prophets are coming from an odd source.... technologists.

    This book boils away the more speculative aspects of the crazy predictions and focuses
    on three trends that have the greatest justification.  

    In that sense this book attempts to take a more conservative stance on .....



    Two Core Arguments


    The natural and rather direct consequences of the following three technologies would result
    in profound upsets in core assumptions we have about the human condition.
      * That people must work to build the things we eat, wear, and use.
      * We all are born grow up, perhaps have children, and then die.
        (That we all age and die in more or less similar time frames.)
      * More stuff requires more work


    The improbably and apocalyptic nature of these predictions should make us skeptical.
    Every generation has its prophets of doom (and of ehuberantly positive stories of wealth),
    why is this any different?


    This book puts forward to core arguments.  Each argument looks at the evidence
    regarding a core enabling technology.

    Because the conclusions being drawn are so "out there" this book attempts to 
    take a careful, but conservative look at the evidence we have today.
    We are happy if others may argue events may unfold in quicker and more 
    radical ways than envisioned in this book.
    We are trying to provide a "lower-bound" or skeptics view of these issues.


    ****************************************************************************
    The First Argument  --  Self replicating, universally programmable, machines

    * Such technology is radical in that it could support:
      - production of many times the current totally world energy usage.
      - knowlege-limited manufacturing processes
      - human-less manufacturing


    * Dependencies


    **************************************************
    The Second Argument  --  Machine Intelligence

    * Such technology is radical in that it could support:
      - 


    * Dependancies
      - The continuation of moore's law.
      - Machine learning technologies
      - Reverse engineering of the brain

      - Estimates of the computational power of the brain
      - Estimates of information theoretic complexity of the human brain

    * Contradicting evidence.

      -  too hot
      -  too much energy
      -  too complicted
    ---  missing the secret sauce
    It is possible that we know so little about core processes required for intelligence,
    that we don't even know about a
