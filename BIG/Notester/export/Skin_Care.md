    CLEANSING
    - Syndets (short for 'synthetic detergents') are mixtures of synthetic surfactants, mainly anionic surfactants with some added amphoteric surfactants to improve their tolerability. Their potential lies in the fact that their pH may be adjusted to that of skin, and they can be enriched with oily compounds.
    - To best maintain the skin surface's physiological balance, it may be better to use syndets rather than soaps for all personal cleansin
