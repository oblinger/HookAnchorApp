    Rob' Ideas: 
    - Get glow by attaching to successful big project. 
    - Get smaller demonstrable projects under belt (Complete smaller projects) 
    - Do not involve my time on Dick project's in parts beyond my expertise area. 
    - Try hard to find "golden fit" ML component to dick/rob projects 
     
    Things that matter 
    - Paper pub in recognized Journal/Conference (ACM) 
    - Instrumental to successful project in some way (that others point to) 
    - Consistent story about what kind of guy you are 
    - Orginazational visibility

    - Check out WXSL 
     
     
     
    * RDF 
    - Steve Petschulat (wants to leave standards org) 
    - Bob schloss (guy to talk to about standards) 
     
    * FORMS 
    - Is there still a forms layer to the Dick/Rob projects?
