    Hi,

    Thank you for your interest in the Academy Conference on "Programming Models: Improving Software Productivity".

    The conference committee have reviewed your submission and have accepted it for the conference. Please complete your presentation (and paper if appropriate) by May 24th and attach to your submission in the conference database (see attached doclink). We are planning for 30 minute presentations grouped into sessions. Each session will also have a combined Q&A for all of the speakers in that session. There is also an opportunity for an evening poster session where you can explain more details. You can decide to include a demo in your presentation or leave the demo to the poster session.

    Please update your speaker status from "Invited Speaker and Poster Presenter" to one of the following as soon as possible:
    "Confirmed Speaker" - speaker only
    "Confirmed Speaker and Poster Presenter" - speaker and poster
    "Confirmed Conference Attendee" - no longer want to speak but still want to attend
    "Declined Speaker" - no longer attending or speaking

    If you have co-presenters that have not yet registered in the conference database, please ask them to register as attendees by May 14th so we have a better idea of numbers.

    IMPORTANT NOTE: The conference has moved one day and will now start on June 2nd and finish early afternoon on June 4th.

    Please contact the conference chairs Michael Perks/Austin/IBM or Mark N Wegman/Watson/IBM if you have any questions.
