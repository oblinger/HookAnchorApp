# Proposal\_Points --

    Before starting off on your next project, or when reviewing a proposal, it might pay to recite the following catechism...
    1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. 
    2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
    3. What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
    4. Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?
    5. What are the risks and the payoffs?
    6. How much will it cost? How long will it take?
    7. What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?
