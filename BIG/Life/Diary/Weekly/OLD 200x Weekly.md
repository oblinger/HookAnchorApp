This morning
1.5h	bed	0
1h	ready	.5
.5	walk	.5
1.5h	food	.5
2h	web	0
6.5		1.5

Lesson learned.  In all cases I need to get to my focused hour *immediately*
That focused hour must be fun too so I want to do it
### 2009.12.19 - not great - low motivation
Things are not great.  I am at a place of very low motivation.  
My current situation is reinforcing some habits that are not great:
No movement with elaine… by having big ideas, but no progress (just putting stuff onto lists), 
Expending the energy to *do* into doing small things (clean house)
Cant break free of existing commitments long enough to hit bottom and take new course, whole weeks are going by, where I am just exhausted in the evening, and only put off anything … everything till the next day…. When it all happens again.

Will attempt new habit:  Morning Default

### 2009.11.09 – Progress

TIME & PROGRESS
•	Life is structured so I often don’t get time for the most important personal things
•	Worse yet, I am biased away from such thinking/activites
•	More still, I don’t really have a plan when I do get time, so it is frittered easily.

I have the sense that even when I do get time, it gets spent w. little consequence.



RESOLUTION – When personal time is available:
•	I need to organize what I most want to get from the time.
•	Around that I need to build a plan.
•	I need to spiritually ground and connect my reasons for action.
