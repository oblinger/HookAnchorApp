    Nancy:

    Religion ... not an issue, but what about all of the short relationships?
    Are you the high-maintaince/hard-to-please/super-picky type?
    (a bit of that is actually a good thing, we boys like to work for things you know...  *grin*)

    I really couldn't see why you wrote, when I looked at your profile.... then I saw the 
    'what you are looking for part'....  I fit!


    >  you're positive and optimistic, you wake up with a smile on your face, and lack road rage.   
    110%

    > Preferably, you're too shy to come up to me in person. I like sort of nerdy, bookish boys who aren't the type to stroll over with a cocky attitude. 
    That is mostly me.  I have a <<>> nerd side (hello.... Ph.D.), but also alot of non-nerdy interests.
    I am actually an extrovert that loves people, so I could <<>> walk over and talk to you in the right context.
    *Unless* I was trying to flirt w. you.....  then my whole brain sort of short curcuits.  yeah, NOT a player!
    (thus my life's dating strategy is to just be friends w. people, then something happens)


    > It would be great to meet someone who cracks me up, has a big heart, teaches me new things, 
    > is a good communicator even of the tough things, and is excited about sharing a life together. 
    100%  and my soul mate will be the same for me.

    > If he likes to camp and hike just as much as he enjoys a classy night out, an awesome live show or a night out dancin', I'd be in heaven.
    My last trip was a week camping in the Amazon followed by a week at a resort spa.
    I love playing dress up, but here in california (I just moved here) that seems to simply mean tucking your shirt 
    in...


    I love what you are looking for!  I want to hear how much of it describes you as well.
    Maybe, by phone, or a coffee sometime...

    'till then,
    -dan
