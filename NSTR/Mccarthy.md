    I share you general optomism that technology extends the range of the 
    possible, and (albeit ineficiently and at time irrationally) we will  
    take advantage of these new abilities to better the human condition. 
     
    Indeed it is my optomism regarding the possibilities advanced by technology 
    that gives me greatest pause when considering our fate as a race. 
     
    There are two scenerios that I feel merit inclusion into you analysis, I  
    will list them below.   
     
     
    1) Unintended consequences.   
     
     
    Reasons to be optomistic 
    - It hasn't happened yet. 
     
    - The world is heterogenous rather than homogenous. 
      Whatever killer mechanism is turned loose will have assumptions 
      of applicabilities, these assumptions are likely to be true for 
      some groups but because of diversity of location, physical makeup,  
      and living conditions it is unlikely to hold for all groups. 
     
     
    Why I remain unconvinced (but willing and hoping to be persuaded): 
     
    - The fact that an asteroid hasn't hit us in a long time is a great 
      reason to be optomistic that it won't in the near future--since nothing 
      relevant has changed. 
     
      The chances of unintended consequences cannot be effectively measured 
      in this way.  Until recently the actions of a few could not have global  
      consequences.
