    PROJECT<<>>BUISNESS OBJECTIVES 
    - Adapt modules from WMR for reading pace tutor 
    * Investigate deploying WMR through WFL 
    * Develop prototype of WMR diagnostic tool 
    * Investigate automatic assessment of reading difficulities based on 
      data automatically currently gathered during use of WMR 
      - determine what level of specificity the inherently noisy data will support 
      - look at non-automated tests currently being done in field 
    * Deploy initial version of the diagnostic tool to schools in Houston. 
    X Investigate w. speech grp  
    X Familiarize w. K-12 proj. 
    RESULTS 
    - Pace tutor

    PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES 
    - ML <<>> KDD conference 
    - K mgt seminars (Alan Marwick) 
    * Actively maintain contacts with Learning researchers at the U. of Ill, HP 
      and SGI 
     
    RESULTS 
     
    ===== 
    TEAM OBJECTIVES 
    - Work w. K12 group to deliver prototypes 
    * Collaborate with IBM global services, and the teacher of the  
      houston school district on the development of the WMR diagnostic tool. 
    RESULTS 
    * Developed an initial prototype of diag tool, and used 
      this along with a prototype developed by Don Nix as initial starting 
      points for multi-day discussions with teachers, administrators, and  
      researchers from the houston school district. 
    * Through these discussions and others here in the lab, we were able 
      to arrive at a single overall architecture for the tool, that satisfied 
      everones initial requirements. 
     
    ===== 
     
     
    BUISNESS: high expectations; demonstrate curiosity, creativity, knowledge;  
              develop clear vision and goals; learn and apply knowledge;  
              innovate in driving new opportunities for IBM 
    TEAM: effective on team; operate across traditional boundaries;  
          demonstrate cooperation & collaborate effectively;  
          demonstrate flexibility; respect diversity 
     
     
     
     
    Develop tutoring prototypes within the K-12 education group.   
    Understand the objectives of  relevant portions of IBM reserach in order to see how my abilities best fit within IBM. 
    Learn the many applications and procedures used within IBM  (Lotus Notes, VM, how projects are created/managed, etc.)   
     
     
    Familiarize myself with all of the current and up coming K-12 projects in order to determine if and how I might productively collaborate on these projects. 
     
    Investigate with the speech group to see if useful detailed data about the speech input exists and can be passed on to the tutor.  Such additional data might be used in a number of ways including: more precise timing of the tutors responses, better recognition of mistakes, and a rudimentary, automated diagnosis of reading problems, and reading ability.
