    A bunch of news and a good handful of people to tell it.  So I was tempted

    I am taking a swing class.  It's really just a mini-course with on four meetings. 
    Still it is alot of fun, and I am not too bad.  (Of course I am sure I will

    My skiing weekend have been moved to next weekend.  I'm looking forward 
    to it, but there hasn't been much snow.... 
     
    Yesterday, I went in door rock climbing with some IBMers.  fun time, 
    but boy am I sore.  I actaully learned alot this time.  I was belaying 
    a really good climber who pointed out several mistakes I was making 
    consistently.  Of course my biggest mistake is not being skinnier,  
    stronger, and longer; but what are U gonna do?
