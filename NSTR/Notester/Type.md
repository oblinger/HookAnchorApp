# Notester.Type --





    WARNING:  Use care here!!  Don't change/delete notes, since they define basic note types for Notester.
              You may extend the hierarchy by adding new note types as children anywhere in this hierarchy.

    This is the tree of Notester Note types.  Many of these note types are built in types (like todo item, 
    or frame layout, etc.)  You may create new types, or subtypes of existing types.  The new types are 
    useful since they posess properties of the base types, but will can be serached for explicitly, 
    and can be specialized.
