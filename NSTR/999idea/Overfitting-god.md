    PREAMBLE:   
     
    For this disussion, we define "Science," as the empirical process 
    of observing the world, and attempting to build generative (predictive) 
    theories of the world that are parsimonious, and consistent w. observation. 
     
    For this discussion we define "God," and as the regular old generic God,  
    "I am who am," etc.

    TWO PERSPECTIVES: 
    Alice believes in God, she interprets the world using this perspective. 
    Bob believes in Science, he interprets the world using this perspective. 
     
    Bob believes that his position is empirically justified, and that Alice's  
    position is not. 
     
     
    WHEN given the slightest provocation Bob will proclaim  
    the empric basis of his belief in science as follows: 
     
    BOB'S MANIFESTO 
    In the beginning man knew facts F1, and built a theory T1 to  
    explain those facts.  Man gazed upon T1 and saw it was good-- 
    it was parsamonious and predictive facts F1 plus new facts F1'. 
     
    In a second age new Facts F2 came to light, and T1 did not imply F2, 
    man with infinite wisdom created T2 such that T1 implied F2 (F2 contains F1). 
    Again man was pleased. 
     
    Down thru the ages man's ingenuity was alway always superior to 
    his ability to perceive.  Each Fi was soon followed by a Ti that implied Fi. 
     
    At each step man started with the ASSUMPTION that Science would suffice. 
    In each previous step a parsimonious theory that did not involve any reference 
    to God was found which predicted know fact.   
    Why should this iteration be different? 
     
    And indeed is was found not to be different.  His intellect was, time after 
    time, up to the task.  He no longer believed in the exact theory Ti that 
    was the theory of his time.  He would say that is was only an  
    approximation, but that it was the best that we knew today, and that we 
    were homing in by successive approximation on ULTIMATE TRUTH. 
     
    Modern man gazed back in time at the sequence of theories Ti, and saw that  
    it was good.  With growing huberious, he declared that not all could be 
    know, but that more and more assertions about the universe could be 
    known with greater and greater certainty. 
     
    When confronted with question about the very nature of the universe, he 
    would look back at the sequence of theories and see if a single consistent 
    prediction could be made by all theories after a certain past theory Ti. 
    If so he would say, "one can never know with absolute certainty but the  
    overwhelming empirical evidence demonstates ..." 
     
    One the subject of "God," man had a clear answer.   
    We have incredible empirical evidence behind a series of Ti, all of 
    which are consistent with the world, and none of which require (or even  
    leave room for) God.  "God does not exist." 
     
    He doesn't know it for a fact, but he has overwhelming emprical evidence. 
     
    <<>> 
    ALICE'S STATEMENT OF FAITH 
     
    Alice by contrast is much less assertive about the objective justifability 
    of her position.  She admits that her beliefs are derived from her 
    feeling that there is a God--her belif is based on faith. 
     
    Her interpretation of the universe starts by assuming that this feeling  
    about God is correct, and she trys to understand 
    the world from this perspective.  She accepts that her position is one 
    based on Faith, but she argues that one must understand the world based 
    on the information availiable, and she unlike Bob she does not preclude 
    subjective facts (feelings) as a possible basis for her understanding. 
     
     
    <<>> 
    THE PLANK IN BOB'S EYE 
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
    From the argument above we see that Bob also has faith, experience cannot 
    be used to justify his belief in science, yet he still believes--he has 
    *faith* in Science. 
     
    Ironically it seems that Alice's acceptance of God based on her subjective 
    sense that God exists is a more internally consistent (rational) position, 
    than Bob's internally inconsistent (irrational) position that his 
    belief in Science is an empirically justified belief.
