    ? What was said in lofty halls?  about me? what worked what didn't 
     
    This year... 
    - should collect data and see if we can answer questions 
    - In addition to that I have 4 other areas I am putting a bit of effort  
      into.  (Bio, Probe placement, Meta Learning, Bayes group) 
    ? I hate to add a new direction just to add one, but do I  
      need a place to hang my hat?
