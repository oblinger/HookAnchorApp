# Inactivity\_Screen\_Flicker --


    BUG:
     After about 1 minute of inactivity my screen will blank momentarily
     As soon as I press any key or move mouse, screen will blank one 
     more time

    SOLN:
     Start -> Programs -> Powertoys For Windows XP -> TweakUI -> 
       Logon -> Screen Saver
         GracePeriod = 0
         Set GRACE PERIOD to 0 (not 30 seconds)
