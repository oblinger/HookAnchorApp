    Hey Mathias. 
     
    How is the professor life?  (In case you are trying to figure out whom 
    this Dan from IBM is, I'll give a hint, you know me through Yoshiko.) 
     
    I talked to Ani a couple of weeks ago about sending along some 
    thoughts I put to paper.  I hope you don't mind, and please spend only 
    what time you schedule allows on this.  Several months ago, I was 
    trying to related an idea about the limits of scientific inquiry to a 
    friend of mine.  He was taken by the idea, and tried to write it up. 
    This in turn got me interested in doing the same.  So that is what I 
    have done. 
     
    There is a notion in statistics and machine learning call  
    "overfitting your data."  This occurs when you use your data to choose 
    an appropriate framework for the problem you are attacking, and then 
    use that same data to validate this framework.  It is an insidious  
    problem that occurs in many subtle ways, one consequence it that you 
    draw conclusions that are not truly statistically justified. 
    It has occurred to me that the basic approach we take in understanding 
    the world (we will call it "the scientific method") is also flawed 
    in exactly this same way.   
     
    In a (vain?) attempt to make this clear, I wrapped up the issue in  
    an imagined debate between Alice and Bob over the existence of God. 
    Truly this argument could be used to attack many/any conclusions 
    one might draw about the nature of the world we live in.  The  
    existence of God, is just a particularly catchy one. 
     
     
    My real hope in sending this to you is to find out how this argument  
    fits in with existing thought.  Is this just a badly mangled variant 
    of a previously explored position?  Has the consequence of overfit 
    (or it moral equivalent) been considered by others?  Does the argument 
    fit together in your mind? 
     
    I tried to defend against a couple of attacks or possible misinterpretations 
    toward the end, but I still feel like there is still much unsaid. 
     
    Anyway, any advice, comments, attacks, references, etc. are very welcome. 
     
    Cheers, 
    Dan
