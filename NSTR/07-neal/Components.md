# 07-neal.Components -- Components

    Neal,  
    Here is what I have right now.  I have included a short summary 
    for each of the patents, a set of figures for each patent, and a 
    numbered list of component objects.  
     
    You suggested that I give you raw text that you then incorporate into 
    the final documents.  I actually prefer this method anyway. 
    I have spent a few hours on these, and I know the details will 
    take further time still. 
     
    I must still make a pass thru the 7 questions for each of the three 
    patents, and find prior art for each, and annotate each component on 
    the patent figures.  I don't really have a clue about the prior art on 
    the education and learning systems side, so I will focus on prior art 
    in the Clustering <<>> Machine Learning areas. 
     
    Talk with you at 6:30! 
     
    Cheers, 
    Dan

    PATENT 3 -- Clustering User Contexts 
    This invention applies unsupervised clustering to a set of user 
    interaction records.  The resulting clustering is used as an 
    additional feature added in with the raw context features.  Both the 
    raw and derived features can then be used to specialize subsequent 
    interaction with the learning system. 
     
     
    PATENT 4 -- Adaptive indexing 
    Both the query issued by the learner and the learner context vector 
    are used in retrieving a set of appropriate library resources.  This 
    indexing is adapted using a supervised learning algorithm.  Feedback 
    from previous user interaction provides data on the success or failure 
    of any particular retrieval.  (A particular retrieval is viewed as 
    successful, if the user selects that particular resource from the list 
    of displayed resources.)  The adaptive indexing algorithm attempts to 
    optimize the indexing function to maximize the number of successful retrievals. 
     
     
    PATENT 5 -- Search Result Ranking Criterion 
    This invention supplies annotations for a set of response resources. 
    These annotations affect among other things, the order that these 
    resources are presented to the user of the learning system. 
     
    The ordering is based on features of the resource itself (e.g. cost,  
    time for response; time to use resource, level of detail of answer in 
    resource, etc.), it is also based on the user's context as well. 
     
    The annotation function itself is derived using a supervised learning 
    algorithm.  Training data for this algorithm is derived from prior user 
    interactions.  Aspects of the user interaction (e.g. which resource is 
    selected for viewing) are used to determine if the most useful 
    resources are being appropriately annotated (e.g. placed high in the 
    list, or being highlighted, etc.)  The learning algorithm optimizes 
    the annotation function based on this Annotation Scoring Metric.
