    Dan here are some thoughts.  I don't beleive that we need a long message about accessibility.  
    * Self introduction as to where you are located in Research (Inductive Learning Research and Applications) and interest in machine learning (1 minute)
    * A brief overview of origin of Personal Wizard (1 minute)
    * Technical presentation (9 minutes) 
    * Your challenge as a person with dyslexia, how does Personal Wizard show potential for you, persons with motor disabilites and blind.(3 minutes)
    * IBM Commitment to a expanded definition of accessibilty (1 minute)  Will send you some slides for you to select...or Net Meeting

    It is my guess that the schedule will be a tight one.

    Bruce.
