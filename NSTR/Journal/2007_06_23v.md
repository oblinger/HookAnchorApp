    She is in room 538 at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902
    Magnolia Drive, Tampa, Florida  33612.  The phone number in her room is
    813-745-2538.  The phone rings loud so if you call I would wait a few
    days.  The doctor said he thought everything looked fine and we will
    just wait for the pathology report to come back in about 10 days.  She
    was in surgery for over three hours and it should be interesting to see
    how she feels this evening.


    She will be on her work email in a couple of days so try this if you
    want to send her a note.  monca@vipworldtravel.travel
