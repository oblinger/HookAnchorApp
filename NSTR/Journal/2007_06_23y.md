    formulation

       What I love about this particular formulation of machine reading problem:


        Forcing teams to build machine reader
        with zero knoweldge of target forces 
        us into very deep uncharted waters
        of a univeral reading system.

                                                   At same time, specifying formal targets
                                                   allows DARPA to construct problem instances
                                                   that take on controlled pieces of the full problem.

                                                   Greatly lowering risk for these special cases, some
                                                   of which yeild transitions that can be had no other way.





    Finally this framing of the problem provides a natural interface allowing results from the program to directly 
    leverage any relevant AI reasoning/processing techniques since we provide control over target representation when needed.


    it can be matched to a appropriate representation.


    into relevant AI reasoning and processing techniques since we

     all AI advancements in reasoning with 

    naturally connect all reading advancements with existing and future AI advancements 

                 

                                      





       Further the combination of the universality of the reading system and the 


       and even these earier controlled pieces have 








    constrain earlier phase
                                                   tasks to be reasonable extensions
    ler
    control complexity of
                                                   problems in each phase.


    constrain problems to
