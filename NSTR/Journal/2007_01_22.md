    --------------
    By the way, thinking about the many people I have met in this last year in DC, I feel
    that this issue is less about race than I often portray it.

    It seems to me that it is about culture.  That there are entire sub-cultures that are disenfranchised, and tend to produce children within the same group.  But these subcultures really cut across racial lines.  I think it is the case that the fraction of the Af Am in the US that are part of that subculture is larger than it is for other races.  But that does not make it an Af Am culture exactly.  You can slice it either way, as that sub-culture  grows to 100% Af Am then it by degrees becomes "Af Am" culture, but today it is far from that 100% point.


    in this way I think our views on the world are not so far apart.
    I am guessing the primary difference is that you believe that "most" of the woes of this subculture would go away if somehow magically the rest of us saw them differently.

    In my case agree this would help alot, but that the biggest differences would be seen if we magically replaced the subculture itself with a different set of habits/values even when the larger communities perception of the subculture didn't change.

    We both agree that both factors are indeed important factors, but 





    Now the claim I am making (which I cannot prove) is that I am an empiricist
