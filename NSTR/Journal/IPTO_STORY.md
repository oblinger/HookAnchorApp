    PLANS:
    * Develop integrated cognitive architecture with unified logic and probability-based representations for transfer learning in several domains
    * Develop transfer learning in strategy games, vision and object perception, and robotic manipulation using hierarchical Bayes networks 
    * Demonstrate domain independence by testing each system against multiple applications <<>> problems
      * Curricula (training ladders) to simulate classroom-like learning
      * Strategy games, mechanics
    * Demonstrate that learning techniques can improve (reasoning and information organization) performance in complex multi-agent environments
    * Demonstrate the ability to combine and restructure knowledge from multiple domains to solve novel problems
    * Develop generalizations and hierarchies of concepts from information gathered and learned to operate successfully in similar, but not identical situations

    IPTO STORY
    * Today, a primary US military advantage over all other militarties in the world is our comprehensive
      application of computation both on and off the battlefield.

    * As this advantage is pushed forward we see the management of complexity in both systems and data
      a critical bottleneck in this vision.

    * Today we use human congnition to manage this complexity, but tomorrow we must offload and automate
      some aspects this congnitive task.

      (As computers grow in compliexity, there will come a point when only computers are equipped to deal
       with that complexity.)

    WE THEN TELL A STORY ABOUT MILITARY APPLICATIONS THAT DRIVE OUR PROGRAMS

    FOLLOWED BY APPLICATION AREAS LIKE PAL, BOSS, ASSIST, ETC.

    When we get to the foundations of ML section we say that:
    * across these many military applications we have identified several fundamental
      limitations of current learning technology that repeatedly come up as constraints 
      on what is possible.

    (1) The first is the capability to learn from very small amounts of data (even a single example).  
        Current tech requires large dataset for generalization, but there are many impt military domains 
        where only obtaining small amounts of data is feasible.

    (2) The second is the cabability to accumulate knowledge learned over time in order to improve learning performance
        on related (but new tasks.)  Current learning technology requires significant amounts of data and oversight
        since each new learning task cannot build from previous gains, new datasets and new configuations must be
        developed for each new application, regardless how related the militaery learning tasks are.

    (3) The third capability is broadly that learning be more human like.  For example, should be more XXX, XXX, XXx etc.
        We approach these qualities by studying how humans achieve these capabilities and apply these insights
       to developmnet of computational equivelents, with the corresponding properties.




    does not gain experience, they are as slow
        solving a task whether it is the first time such a task type is seen or the thousanth time
        a similar learning task is attempted.

    accumulate knowledge learned over time, Thus they are
        as slow at learning 

    (3) Accumulate Knowledge from experience on different problems
        to be effective new problems.
