    GIVEN 
    - Set of labelled strings 
    - Produce a classifier for unlabelled strings that maximizes some 
      specified linear tradeoff between false positives and false negatives 
      in the training data. 
    - The space of hypotheses is the set of regular expressions 
      composed of elements from the set:  SetOfFixedChars union <<>> 
      Informally this is expressions that allow match all '.*' and disjunction '|' 
     
    POSSIBLE ALG 
     
     
    Greedy 
    - Input N and P 
    - Compute MAX the set of maximal patterns that cover at least one p in P 
    - Let Nc, Pc = null 
    - For i from 1 to |N| 
      - Add n to Nc where n is chosen from N\Nc inorder to maximizes |Pc| where 
        DISJUNCTi = <<>> 
        Pc = UNION Cover(DISJUNCTi, P) 
    - Choose, r, such that DISJUNCTr has the best tradeoff of Cover(N) and Cover(p) 
    - return DISJUNCTr
