    You'll want to arrive Sunday Mar 4th and we'll arrange a hotel room at
    the Holiday Inn Miami. And Royal Caribbean we get into port at around
    10:00am on Friday Mar 9th and it takes a couple hours to disembark and
    go thru customs. So don't book a departing flight any earlier than
    2:00pm.

    As far as dressing up for the wedding and stuff...
    The wedding is semi formal. I'm going to wear a suit (no tie) and Amy is
    wearing a black cocktail dress. Amy is fine if the other ladies wear
    black too.

    Dinner is business casual each night. No shorts, Tees or flip-flops.

    There's more details on the itinerary our site at www.klanac.com

    Hi Dan,
    We have a site with details, registry etc.

    Go into the Royal Caribbean site via links on our site to see info
    about activities.  You'll need to create an id and password and
    reference your reservation number - 9786602.

    ---------------------
