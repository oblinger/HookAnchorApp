    The Recipe (Serves 3 to 4)

    3 cups water 
    1 cup whole milk 
    1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
    1 cup steelcut oats 
    1/4 teaspoon salt 

    1. Bring water and milk to simmer in large saucepan over medium heat, meanwhile, heat butter 
    in medium skillet over medium heat until just beginning to foam; add oats and toast, stirring 
    constantly with wooden spoon, until golden and fragrant with butterscotch like aroma, 1 1/2 
    to 2 minutes.

    2. Stir toasted oats into the simmering liquid, reduce heat to medium low; Simmer gently, 
    until mixture thickens and resembles gravy, about 20 minutes. Add salt and stir lightly with 
    spoon handle. Continue simmering, stirring occasionally with wooden spoon handle, until oats 
    absorb almost all liquid and oatmeal is thick and creamy, with a pudding-like consistency, 
    about 7 to 10 minutes. Off heat, let oatmeal stand uncovered 5 minutes. Serve immediately. 

    We like to use steel cut oats from the bulk section of a natural food store--they are fresher 
    and less expensive.

    Message:     
     I've been making McCann's steel cut oats just about every morning for about a year now. 
     After quite a bit of experimentation, my recipe is as follows:
     
    Then night before, cook 1/2 cup of McCann's steel cut oats in about 1 tablespoon of fat (I use 
    olive oil, but butter or vegetable oil work too) over medium heat, stirring constantly. 
    Attention is required here -- oats burn very easily. If they burn, throw them out and start 
    over. After about three minutes, when the frying oats start to give off a nice nutty aroma, 
    carefully pour two cups of hot water into the pot. You need to wear a mitt when you do this 
    or the steam will burn you. Cut about an inch off of a Madagascar or Tahitian vanilla bean, 
    split it in half, and add it to the pot. Bring the mixture to a rolling boil, cover, turn off 
    the stove, and go to sleep.
     
    The next morning, add about 1 cup of milk (I use 2%, but whole milk will produce a richer 
    porridge), 2 tablespoons of vanilla sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt, and sometimes, 
    1/4 teaspoon of good cinnamon powder (like Penzy's Vietnamese) and/or a little bit of 
    vanilla extract. Find the piece of vanilla bean, scrape the seeds into the oatmeal, discard 
    the husk. Cook, uncovered, over low heat until porridge is creamy, like hot oatmeal pudding. 
    Serve sprinkled with a touch of cinnamon sugar or brown sugar and/or a bit of butter or cream. 
     
    Hope you like it.

    Steel Cut Oatmeal for the Crockpot #101101 
    I love the texture of steel cut oats. You can make this the night before and breakfast is 
    ready in the morning. I like fruit additions, but my kids do not, so I've listed them as 
    optional. Also, it may sound like a lot of water, but trust me, I've experimented. 
    1  cup steel cut oats (DO NOT substitute old-fashioned or quick-cooking oats)  
    4 1/2  cups water  
    1/2  teaspoon salt  
    2-3  tablespoons butter  
    1/2  cup dried fruit (raisins, prunes, apricots, dates) (optional)  
    Serve with 
     milk, to taste  
     sugar, to taste  
     cinnamon, to taste  
     maple syrup, to taste  

    -Place all ingredients in a 2 quart slow cooker. 
    -Cover and cook on LOW 6-8 hours. 
    -It might form a "crust" around the outside. Just scrape it down with a spoon and stir it in.

    Best Grains for Porridge

    Cracked wheat 
    Steel-cut oats 
    Coarse-ground corn (polenta or grits) 
    Whole or cracked brown rice 
    Spelt 
    Kamut 
    Millet 
    Barley 
    Amaranth 
    Quinoa 
    ...or really any grain you like! 
     


    Just about any grain makes a good porridge. The key is to cook them longer than you would 
    were you to serve the same grain for dinner, and in more water. What makes the porridge my 
    family eats taste better than what you probably remember from childhood is that we don't 
    buy it in boxes and keep it on the shelf for years. We buy fresh grain, usually from the 
    bulk bins or in big sacks direct from the mill, and stay away from rolled cereals, like 
    what you probably think of as oatmeal. 

    And what about oats?
    Rolled oats are great for cookies and granola, but when it comes to a proper porridge what you want are steel-cut oats. These also go by the names pinhead, Scottish, Irish, coarse-cut or porridge oats. Unlike rolled oats, which have been steamed and then rolled flat into a flake, steel-cut oats are the raw grain (a groat when you're talking oats), very coarsely ground--chopped or cracked, really. This makes for a much chewier, firmer textured porridge with a nutty, full-bodied flavor. One bowl of steel-cut oat porridge and you'll be a believer. 

    In the US probably the most famous brand of steel-cut oats is McCann's Irish Oatmeal, which 
    makes an extremely tasty porridge; it's also wildly expensive for what it is (over $6 for 28 
    ounces at Trader Joe's last time I bought it). Bob's Red Mill makes a good version, though I 
    find it too finely ground for my own taste. The Bob's version cooks much faster than the 
    McCann's, which takes a full half-hour. 

    Grinding your grain yourself
    Best by far, and often cheaper in the long run if you factor in waste and nutrition since 
    whole grain lasts much longer than milled grain, is to buy whole grains and grind them 
    yourself. I have a small hand grinder. It was inexpensive--under $50. You can get attachments 
    for your mixer or invest in a fancy electric grinder, but I find that there's something 
    satisfying about using a hand-powered grinder. Lehmans.com has a wide variety of them in 
    many price ranges.  

    Once a week or so I toast some grain in a dry frying pan on the stove just until they start 
    to emit a nutty smell. Then, once they cool, I grind them on the coarsest setting on my grain
    mill. Children like to help with this sometimes, especially if you have a hand grinder. What 
    you are going for is barely ground--cracked, really; if you end up with flour, you've gotten 
    it too fine. Make some bread. Then I store the ground grain in an airtight tin (a McCann's 
    tin as it happens) until I need it. I try not to grind more than I can use in a week. 

    Having said all this, I need to emphasize that you do NOT have to go to all that trouble to 
    make a good porridge. Just buy small batches of cracked grains from a reputable source--make 
    sure it hasn't been sitting on a shelf since the Truman Administration, or even the Clinton 
    Administration. 

    Cooking it up
    It's variable, but a safe rule of thumb for porridge is one part grain to four parts water. You want it wetter than you would make the same grain for dinner. 

    My favorite way to prepare it used to be in a very small crockpot I've had since I left home, a little one-person pot that makes exactly enough porridge for the family's breakfast as long as we're not all incredibly starving. I put the grain and the water in the pot the night before, put the cover on, plugged it in and forgot about it. Another method: Try a widemouth thermos: Put the grain and water in the thermos, cover with a tea cozy or thick kitchen towel and you should have nicely cooked porridge in the morning. 

    Since I discovered Nourishing Traditions, however, the way I cook my porridge has changed. It's also made it faster. The night before, I put my cracked grain in my rice cooker (without a rice cooker you could use just a plain pot) with water to cover and a pinch of salt. In the morning, I add more water, start my rice cooker (or use the stovetop method below) and in about 10-15 minutes I have rich, creamy porridge. Soaking the grain makes the nutrients in it more bio-available, as well as speeding up the cooking times. The rice cooker makes it almost as easy as toast.

    Failing any of these, you can use the old reliable stovetop method. Put your water and a pinch of salt on the stove to boil in a pot with a lid. When you've got a good rolling boil, pour your grain into the water in a thin stream, stirring as you go. This will prevent lumps. Turn the water down to simmer and cook for 20 minutes, stirring frequently. If you have a flame tamer or heat diffuser to put under the pot, so much the better; it will keep the porridge from scorching. Pop the lid on, take it off the heat and let it sit for another 5-10 minutes. 

    Serve it forth

    Serve your porridge with--pick one--maple syrup, honey, brown sugar, molasses, jam, raisins, minced dried fruit, sliced fresh fruit--and milk, rice milk, cream or even buttermilk as they do in Scotland (not as odd as it sounds on oats, though not my favorite). Add a pat of butter, or not. Add a sprinkling of cinnamon, or not. 

    My favorite toppings depends on what's in the porridge. If it's all or mostly corn, I put molasses or honey, butter and just enough milk to thin it. If it's brown rice (delicious for breakfast!) all I put on it are raisins and cinnamon. With oats, it's milk, brown sugar or real maple syrup, cinnamon and a little butter. 

    You will find that a breakfast of porridge will fuel you for your day like no other. We eat it year round; it's cheap, it's incredibly nutritious, and beautifully delicious.

    In the book, "An Edgar Cayce HOME MEDICINE GUIDE" it states on page 24: "One of the methods of doing this (cooking steel cut oats a long time) is to bring the cereal to a boil and then pour the cereal and (with) the boiling water into a widemouth thermos, which is closed and left overnight, cooking the cereal completely." 

    If I myself did not use this method, I would never have the patience to make it for myself at all! IT WORKS and IS EASY to get started just before going to bed. 

    Fill your wide mouth thermos with very hot tap water, cover and let sit while you: 
    Measure out your steel cut oats and cold water into a small saucepan. 
    For one serving I use 1/4 cup steel cut oats. 
    1 cup water 
    A small pinch of salt 
    Bring the water with the cereal in it to a boil, turn down the heat while you: 
    Empty your thermos of it's hot tap water and pour the contents of the small saucepan into it instead. 
    Cover tightly and let sit overnight. In the morning it will be ready to eat! 
    The cereal generally just 'slides' right out of the thermos. If not, I take my rubber scraper or a long handled serving spoon that I have and empty out the rest. 
    Then I fill the thermos with hot sudsy water and wash it out with the help of my kitchen sponge and a fork or something, or a bottle brush. Most of the time the whole thing is quite effortless. 

    Note: On rare occasion, when the cereal is not as hot as I'd like in the morning, I reheat it in the small saucepan
