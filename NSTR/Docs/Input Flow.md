    There are many ways to enter info into Notester.  The process listed above takes 2 seconds of 
    thinking, ensures info can be found later, and that todo items do not fall through the cracks:
    Before continuing please follow this link to print out the Notester <<>> cards.

    <<>>
    "NO TIME TO THINK?"   
    This is used to capture info anytime you dont want to break your flow on some other activity.  
    Creates a new entry in your InBox where you can just type or paste text.  The top line will of
    the entry be the title line displayed in your inbox for this entry.

    <<>>
    "WHERE TO PUT IT?"
    P?  First Question:  Should the info have a permanent name?
                         Only if you will continue to access it by that name for months or years to come.
    F?  Second Question: Does it have associated files?
                         If so, PROJECTS and ACTIVITIES provide permanent file folder locations for storage.
    T?  Third Question:  Does info belong in a new toplevel category?
                         Try to organize info into sub categories so they become children of something else.  
                         Grouping related topics helps find it, if you forget its name among hundreds<<>>thousands.

    TOPLEVEL  verses  SUB-PROJECT <<>> CHILD-NOTE
    Your largest projects and subprojects should have a concise abbreviations as names.  They are quick
    and you will remember them since you access them all the time.
    Topics are created for distinct pieces of info, primarily accessed by their name.
    For example, phone+account numbers for health benefits, might be in 'Health Benefits' topic 
    which is child of 'HR' child of 'Work Info' child of 'The abbreviation of your employer'

    ASSOCIATED FILES?
    Use PROJECT and ACTIVITIES to hold such info since they have associated folders.
    'TAB-E' will open the explore on the folder.  (See <<>> for frequent access.)

    NAMED?
    Avoid giving permanent names to transient activities, since those names will clog your system over
    the years.  Activities, Meetings, and Journal entries all have names that begin with dates.
    This means that you search for them by recency (which is almost instant for the last 15-30 entries.
    It also means that their names do not clog your Notester, so with zero effort on your part this items
    will naturally receede into the past as time marches on.

    <<>>
    "HOW TO REMEMBER IT?"     (See <<>> for details on this section)
    * CALENDAR.  If item requires action at specfic time, add to your calendar (outside of notester)
    * WATERFALL. If it is important that an item occurs within some general timeframe then add it to the
      appropriate waterfall of todo lists.  (See <<>> for details)
    * CONTEXT.   If action is not urgent and requires a specific context, then add it to the appropriate 
      context menu: Agendas, Net, Joy
    * NOTHING.   Otherwise no reminder is needed.  Much info is simply reference material, you will know 
      when you need it, then you find it by the name of the note or by searching (TAB-S) for recently entered items
