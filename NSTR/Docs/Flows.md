    WHAT IS A FLOW?
    - A flow is habit developed for some simple repeated process.
    - A successful flow should be memorable and should only
      only require fractions of a second for the decisions making
      required for each step.
    - The idea with notester is to develop flows for entering info
      flows for deciding what you should be working on next, etc.

    ACTION FLOW
    The Start View is structured to quickly answer the question:
       "What should I be doing now?"

    * The middle panel (from FIRST/IN-BOX over to OPPORTUNE/B-LIST)
      contain lists that should be repeatedly viewed.  The first
      three columns should be visually scanned in the following
      way each time you come back to notester for a new task:

    * If 'first' has any entries, then they should be done first.

    * In-box entries should generally be performed, filed or move to another list.

    * The very top portions of 'Todo' 'Week' and 'Monitor' have the most
      important actions to be taken.  Choose one and do it.

    That is the basic Action Flow, with practice it can be executed
    effortlessly in fractions of a second.
