# Docs.Type --


    The Noteser Types page defines the Notester types hierarchy.

    This these notes define the space of notester types, and defines the inheritance hierarchy for
    properties of noterster notes.  Notester comes with a set of builtin types like Menu Type, and Meeting Type.


    Usefully changing the Notester type hierarchy would require deep understanding of notester.
    You should be motester max-zum-dweebie to attempt this.  
    Someday when I get around to it, I will write some docs for this....
