    TITLE:  Dynamic Model Selection in IOHMMs

    LOCATION:  Watson
    ABSTRACT:  In this paper we describe adaptive model selection methods for an 
    extension of the IOHMM called SimIOHMM. We show how to select the initial 
    number of states of the HMM, how to decide when to add new states during the 
    Baum-Welch iterations, and how to modify the Baum-Welch algorithm to 
    efficiently add new nodes. We show that the SimIOHMM with dynamic model 
    selection yields substantial computational gains over the IOHMM with no or 
    little impact on predicting abilities.
