# Prelim.Proposed-work -- Proposed work section

    XXXX intro: two ideas.  (1) Pieces of K.
      (2)  hyp space of alternatives that match 
    XXXX ways to split bias into pieces
     1) Intermediate observation
     2) Quasi-independance
     3) ???
    > This section summarizes the work done in this dissertation, with
    special attention paid to those parts that are proposed work to be
    done.
    Framework is done.  Testing its ability to encode bio. expertise as
    bias.  And testing the relative strength of its bias to other
    ind. systems is done. 
    REFINEMENT SPACE SPECIFICATION
    PICK FUNCTION
    - Define a generic pick function 
    - Discuss when one would want to provide a specialized function instead.
    - Analyze cases where we have utilized a specialized pick function
    INTERMEDIATE OBSERVATION
    - What is it?
    - Incorporate into PI framework.
    - Demonstrate its use in the bio domain.
    1D-MAP EXPERIMENTS
    - 1) Use intermediate observations to optomize recognizers for local structures
      2) Combine these w. weighted average or aggregation refinement space
         to obtain fold class recognizer.
    ANALYSIS (answer questions)
    1) Under what conditions do optimal refinement algorithms result in
       optimal induction.
    2) Conditions for convergence.
