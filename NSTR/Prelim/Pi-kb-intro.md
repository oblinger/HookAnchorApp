# Prelim.Pi-kb-intro -- Intro w. reference to kb approaches

    TITLES:
      Applying the PI framework to the problem of HHM.
    - Powerful tools exist that succinctly express
      completely determined certain relationships.
    - Difficult to express expertise w/o overcommitment.
    - Many mechanisms for dealing w. uncertainty
      Each make general assumptions about type of uncertainty
      and deal w. that type of uncertainty.
    - Example of two stmts w. very different types of uncertainty
      Note <<>> set of specializations are approapriate for each.
    - The means we know more about the domain than the statments, we
      know something about the uncertainty in these rules
    - It also means there is no single ``right'' meaning for uncertainty.
    - The correct uncertainty model for each case is dependant on
      what is understood by the expert, and what can be effectively handled by
      a computational mechanism.
    > None the less, we believe (and demonstrate in this thesis), that
      a few models of uncertainty can be used to effectively capture a
      wide range of expertise w/o overcommitment.
    - We present several types of uncertainty and computational mechanisms 
      for reasoning w. these types of K.
    - and a framework that integrates these mechanisms so they may be used
      in conjunction.
    > Many types of uncertainty that we present have been studied extensively.
      One major type of uncertainty that we call K. interaction has not
      been adequtely addressed, and is impt. because it is associated w.
      a very common type of over commitment.
    - Thus we describe it first.
    Idea:
    - Information theoretic contribution of learning must be small.
    - Thus complex learning can only result from complex bias.
    - General KB problem: Difficult to encode K w/o overcommitment.
    - Goal: encode expertise w/o overcommitment.
    Idea:
    - existing models of uncertainty assume that peice of K
      represents some set of alternatives (the uncertainty)
    - We focus on uncertainty based on interactions
      (may have trouble differentiating from non-mon w. this argument)
