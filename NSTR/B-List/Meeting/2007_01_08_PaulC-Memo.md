    Memo about Cohen

    ----------------
    In particular, it
    [The curriculum team] must ensure that sub-performers will not be in a position to control 
    important aspects of the tests that they, or those with whom they are affiliated, 
    will subsequently be receiving in a learning team role.  

    * Any inputs that are provided by sources with possible 
    conflicts must be cleansed in some way that ensures the integrity of the evaluations.

    Paul Cohen asked me the following question:

    I called Paul to clarify exactly what kind of evaluation support he might be providing.
    I got his answering machine, and began to ask my question, and to think aloud about the
    question, and whether or not these assurances would suffice.  At the time I thought these
    assurances seemed pretty good to me.  Ultimately, however, I asserted that 
    it would not be possible to provide an answer to this question, rather it would 
    need to be assessed by the source selection committee, once the proposal was in.

    I composed an answer to the question to add to the FAQ.  Both Charlie Holland and Nancy Kremers
    felt I could not offer any opinion (not even a personal opinion that was publically shared).
    Charlie also argued that one of the central guarantees suggested by Paul
    (the guarantee to resign) was essentially meaningless.  

    Thus produced the FAQ entry listed below as a response to this question.  I also explicitly 
    called Paul and reinforced the following two points:

    (1) The it was not possible to assess the particulars of this consulting arrangement.  They would
        simply have to submit a propals and have it be evaluated.

    (2) I also told Paul that I since my initial phone call I had had subsequent discussions at DARPA
        specifically about his question, which afforded me other perspectives on his question.
        My 60 seconds of talking aloud did not refect my opinion about this, and that I could not
        give him any information about my subsequent discussions.  He simply needed to carefully 
        read the BAA, and base their choices on the text supplied there.

    My goal was to ensure that Paul did not incorrectly believe he had gained some sense of 
    how the committe might react to his proposal.




    ---------------------------------------------
    A primary concern with respect to teaming is to avoid a conflict of interest (as explained in FAR 9.5) that could result in contamination of the go/no-go evaluations.  Thus, it is not permissible to be a prime for both the curriculum team and a learning team.  Additionally it is the responsibility of the curriculum team to guarantee the integrity of the testing provided by its curriculum ladders and by its evaluation process.  In particular, it must ensure that sub-performers will not be in a position to control important aspects of the tests that they, or those with whom they are affiliated, will subsequently be receiving in a learning team role.  Any inputs that are provided by sources with possible conflicts must be cleansed in some way that ensures the integrity of the evaluations.   The curriculum team must articulate in its proposal how it will ensure that the integrity of its evaluations is maintained.
