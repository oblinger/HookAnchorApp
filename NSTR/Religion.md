    Dan,
          The books that immediately came to mind were Josh MacDowell's
    Evidence That Demands a Verdict (a bit of a chore to get through) and Lee
    Strobel's The Case for Christ (a lighter reading, more popular book which
    mentions John Crossans' Jesus Seminar).  There are many others that have a
    scientific "bend" to them (those by Polkinghorne, Dembski, for instance).

    Sorry, but I didn't see a familiar face in the room.  I don't know if a
    list were generated...I requested (& received) an e-mail reminder of the
    seminar -- if others did, perhaps someone has the list.  The diversity host
    may know some of the attendees.

    Lately, I've been reading Jesus Among Other Gods, but have heard that
    anything by William Lane Craig would be excellent from an intellectual,
    philosophical, academic perspective -- for Christians and nonChristians
    alike.  An amazon search on his name should bring up a list of titles for
    you to browse through.  Perhaps we could begin with Philosophical
    Foundations for a Christian Worldview and work our way through the others.
