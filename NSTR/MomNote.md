    Milosovitch  (the former president of Yugoslavia and also a Christian) killed more Muslims than all of those bombings listed below combined.

    Does this give the Muslims the right to boycott me because I am a Christian?
    I say no, because I don't agree with what Milosovitch did, and I didn't help him
    do it, so it's not fair for them to blame me (or to do anything to me) because of
    what he did.

    True many Muslims believe that America has too much power, and uses that power
    too often in the world.  But the vast majority of Muslims do not support the bombings
    listed below.  Most (but not all) Muslim governments and most (but not all) Muslim 
    people condemned all of those bombings as evil, and they helped track down the Muslims
    who committed those crimes.


    If all Christians are not responsible for Milosovitch, how can we make all Muslims responsible
    for Bin Ladin.


    I am truly amazed over and over again at the human brain's ability 
    to earnestly believe it is being "fair" exactly when it is applying
    two completely different standards to itself and to others.

    I only realized this obvious inconsistency a hour after reading the email.

    I have the feeling that we humans are applying significantly imbalanced double standards all the time
    but go on believing we are "fair" because there are rarely these exactly parallel examples 
    available to mathematically demonstrate our own inconsistency.


    I just can't resist giving two more examples seen recently in the news that seem to be 
    accepted without question.

    (1) Saddam's who attacks his own people and his enemies with poison gas is an evil menace and should be removed from power.

    Who can argue with this, it seems clear, right?  Except that we supported Iraq *during* and *after* it was doing that gassing.  
    If it deserves to be attack 20 years after it did it why did we support them *while* they
    were doing it?  Right now there are thousands dead and over 800,000 internally displaced refugees (mostly Kurdish) in Turkey.  
    What they are doing to the Kurds right now (in terms of numbers) is far worse than what Saddam did in his day.

    Why was is Turkey good and Saddam bad?  Why was Saddam a good guy while he committed this crime, and
    a bad guy for the crime today.


    (2) Iraq is a threat to its neighbors we will be doing them a favor be getting rid of him.

    Makes sense, except that all of its neighbor don't want us to get rid of him.
    It amazes me that we go on believing that we are doing them a favor exactly when they are telling
    us not to do it!


    I don't mean to say that that Saddam is not an evil man, he is.  I am just amazed at our ability 
    to be razor sharp at detecting inconsistencies that are not in our favor, but 
    to actauly believe obvious inconsistencies when they are what we want to hear.

    We are "helping" countries that are begging us not to.  We are defending against crimes 
    commited by a country that was an ally during/after it committed those crimes.



    (3) Iraq might give weapons to terrorists, so we better get him before he does.

    This one is not exactly a logical inconsistency, but it has problems.

    * Most of the terrorists belive in an Islamic state they hate Saddam because he does not.
      He does not allow these religious groups to have strong hold in his country, 
      that is why terrorists come from Saudi Arabia (our ally) and don't come from Iraq (our enemy.)

    * Saddam's aggression does not come from any kind of idealism, but it comes from a 
      desire to increase his own power.  Attempting to take over Iran and later Kuwait are
      both examples of him attempting to increase his power.
      Giving a weapon to a terrorist has a 0% chance of increasing his power, and if that 
       terrorist uses that weapon against the united states it has a 100% chance of
       eliminating his power (and probably his life).

    * Yemen, Sudan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Iran.  Are countries that allow religious 
       fanaticism to live within their borders.  In some cases they even support the 
       terrorists within their borders.


    Yes Iraq could give whatever weapons of mass destruction it has left to terrorists, but
    it doesn't seems near the top of the list of Countries that might do so.

    Dear Fellow Patriotic Americans:



    REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of Pan Am Flight 103,



    REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993,



    REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the Marine Barracks in Lebanon,



    REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the military Barracks in Saudi Arabia,



    REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the American Embassies in Africa,



    REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the USS COLE.



    REMEMBER the MUSLIM attack on the World Trade Center on 9/11/01.



    REMEMBER all the AMERICAN lives that were lost in those vicious MUSLIM
    attacks.



    Now the United States Postal Service REMEMBERS and HONORS the EID MUSLIM
    holiday season with a commemorative first class holiday postage stamp.



    I strongly urge you to REMEMBER to adamantly and vocally BOYCOTT this stamp
    when purchasing your stamps at the post office. To use this stamp would be a
    slap in the face to all those AMERICANS who died at the hands of those whom
    this stamp honors.



    I also strongly urge you to pass this along to every Patriotic AMERICAN you
    know, whether by email or otherwise.
