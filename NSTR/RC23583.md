    ABSTRACT:  We explore the topics of user-interface instrumentation functionality and design in support of advanced features such as automation, adaptive documentation, intelligent tutoring, automated testing, and programming-by-demonstration. We propose a description of the interaction between user and computer applications in terms of a state-action model, we show how it is sufficient to support advanced UI functionalities, and we analyze the main points and trade-offs in the design of an instrumentation layer based on the state-action model. We discuss how the design principles could be practically applied using as supporting examples two systems, Sheepdog and DocWizard, developed on different platforms.  We finally suggest a set of guidelines, intented for designers of application platforms such as operating systems, that facilitate the task of layering advanced UI functionalities on top of existing applications.
