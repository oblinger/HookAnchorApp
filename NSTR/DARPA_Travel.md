# DARPA\_Travel --


    === PROCESS ===
    Since I have been inundated with travel requests, updated estimates, date changes, etc. I decided we need a better system.  Please send the following data elements to Natalie Cubbal.  
                Dates of Travel
                Destination
                Estimated Amount
                Justification, including the program it is related to
    Natalie will compile the list for Dan and Norm to review once a week.  You, or your travel coordinator, will then be notified whether your trip has been approved or not.  Hopefully this will make the process smoother for everyone!



    ======= TEMPLATE ======  (Out of date)

    Tomica,

    Here is the travel template that I use.  
    * Each item goes on its own line.
    * Use blue label  "Travel Required.
    * Be sure the reminder is set to "0 minutes" and is turned off (otherwise it wakes me at 6am by default!)
    * Add a seperate entry just titled "Flight" at the time of each flight with a 3 hour reminder.
    * Be sure I have a phone number for the hotel, and you can use airport codes for DC area airports
