    As part of our overall Adventerous Research project's goal this year I am attacking the simultaneous align-generalization problem.
    - Demonstrating efficacy on live data from the windows desktop is my primary win for 2003.
    - We will use this demonstrated efficacy to establish linkages that will eventually yield impact of this technology for IBM.
    - We will also establish a publication plan for demonstrating IBM's strength in alignment based programming by demonstration.


    I will improve IBMs connection to the upcomming candidate pool for new hires.  At both Northwestern and Columbia University
    I will be representing IBM to potential new hires, and I will provide feedback to IBM regarding stronger candidates at these
    Universities.


    [[EXECUTE]]

    - We will meet the 12 month milestones (presented in June) for the Adventerous Research project.
      The primary milestone is a working "live documentation" system which presents the user with
      annotations dynamically as a function of the state of the Windows Desktop.

    - This year we will build an alignment-generalization engine, and 
      empirically evaluate alternative instantiations.

    - As a first step toward establishing IBM's position within Programming By Demonstration we will publish in key workshop(s) 
      paper(s) describing our Personal Wizard effort.

    - We will protect Personal Wizards intellectual property through a series of patents


    - Professional Activities
      - I will serve as an Adjunct Professor at Columbia University teaching E6880 "Statistical Pattern Recognition"
        This will facilitate IBM presence and knowledge of the candidate work for at Columbia
      - I will serve as an Area Chair at ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning).  
        This conference is a key conference for at two PICs (KDD, and AI)
      - I will serve as reviewer for other conferences, and will provide external presentation, stand as a member of
        professional organizations, etc.


    [[TEAM]]

    - I will serve as the Campus Relationship Manager at Northwestern University
      - I will be a visible represntative of IBM on campus.
      - I will track strong students across multiple relevant departments at the
        university.

    - I will mentor a Student here at IBM this summer.


    - I will release a new version of "At A Glance" a system I developed four years ago
      as a service for the Adult Education research program within IBM's Education 
      reserach.
