    Nate note


    Now that we have secured many locations where goods are being transfered we
    see the bad guys transferring goods directly between vehicles.

    - recognize a possible transfer, and a truck stopping where it rear is
      near another truck.
    - when this happens we "loiter invisibly" for 10 minutes waiting to see if
      a truck-to-truck loading occurs

    if "truck-to-truck" loading occurs
    - disregard the "loiter invisibly" and survey transfer location   
    - if this location is an "unusual transfer location" then 
        immediate alert cenrtal command
        perform continuous "scrutinizing survey"
    - wait for 1/2 hour for the target truck to leave
    - if the target truck leaves follow it for 1/2 hour or until it "parks"

    The Reporting Stuff  (goes in the 'then part' of 'truck-to-truck loading'
    - Add a movement cartoon to the nightly report summary:
      Show path of both vehicles in cartoon

    (Maybe that is all there is to specifying the report?)
