# Theo\_Book.Introduction --


    A reductive view of the universe has proven to be a very powerful 
    approach in understanding the world in which we live.  It is one of the key 
    tennants of the current scientific world view, and that world
    view has afforded humanity unprecidented practical power and
    control over the universe.  

    The practical benefits of this approach over the last two centuries
    have been staggering, which has led many to accept this world view as
    a "correct" world view.  I accept the scientific world view (including
    reductionism) as a correct world view--correct in that it is a useful 
    way to understand the universe.

    But this world view seems at odds with most all theologies of the world.
    Indeed these theologies were developed at a time when reductionism was not 
    really widely known, and certainly was not and accepted world view.
    In that respect is is not surprising that those theologies are not
    based on reductionaism and a scientific world view.

    But does this mean that the essential points inherent in these world theology
    must be *inconsistent* with a scientific world view?  On the surface
    they seem to be quite opposed to one another.  Indeed most of humanity 
    explicitly or in their heart views theology as "unscientific." Further many strong believers
    in science reject theology on the grounds that is it not consistent with a scientific world view.

    This text calls that assumption into question.  Here we accept that science
    and many related consensus dogma like evolution, reductionism are correct, in that they 
    have been empirically shown to be an effective way of understanding, predicting,
    and manipulating the universe.  We accept that they can uncover "truth" 
    about our universe.  We then look at some of the core theological
    beliefs in this context and try to understand what those beliefs might mean
    in this new context.  We do not try to prove these beliefs, but we try to understand
    if and how they might be formulated in this new world view, and once formulated
    do they make sense from that new world views perspective.





    WHO SHOULD READ THIS, AND HOW SHOULD IT BE READ
    The religious reader will find this text to be a contrived and hoplessly conservative approach that misses
    most of important theological ideas.  The open-minded, but skeptical, athiest, scientist on the other hand
    will probably find themselves grudging conceeding to one point after another in the text.  Each point will
    often feel like it has been won on a technicality--that is how we felt when coming to each of these conclusions.
    We believe that all the points if viewed as a whole, however, result in a significanly shifted world view.




    -----------------------

    * there is an inconsistency, the inconsistency is between our still held pre-scientific notions of common words like 'exist' 
      'purpose' etc, and what those words must mean according to a modern scientific world view.  we believe that this inconsistency
      fuels the belief that god is not consistent with science, since we employ pre-scientific notion of exist to god and then
      show that he cannot exist by that standard, but this is inappropriate, we will show that nothing can exist in the scientific
      world view according to some defintions of exist, so this tells us nothing about God, rather it tells us something about 
      humanities state of mixed models of the universe.  To rectify this we start with our commonsense notion for many words
      and then work out a definition for those words in our new scientific world view.  It is these new definitions that we
      then apply in our discussions of faith.  In some cases these definitions will fly in the face of our expectations, but
      like quantum physics, according to the scientific world view we must adjust our expectations, not our emprically derived 
      laws of the universe.
