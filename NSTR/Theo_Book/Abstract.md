# Theo\_Book.Abstract --


    Are you interested in the largest questions about life and its meaning, but
    have the sneaking suspicion that Science has it all right and religion has it all wrong?

    If so this text is designed for you.  It embraces modern scientific methods as well as currently accepted
    scientifically-based world models and goes on to build and edifice that is not quite what most religions teach as
    truth, but supports ideas surprisingly far into what is traditionally thought of as the spiritual realm.


    ----


    The scientific work view is now the dominant world view held by many in the world today.

    The wild successes of the Science has lead many to adopt this a their primary world view.
    Many of these same people further believe that this world view at a very minimum does
    not support the ideas contained in most world theologies.  Indeed, as I did, they suspect 
    that religion is nothing more than wishful thinking based on ruminations of
    a pre-scientific world.  God probably doesn't exist, science says so.

    In this text we adopt a throughly modern scientific world view as our starting point.
    This includes methods that scientists use to understand the world, as well as those 
    theories that that the consensus of todays scientists accept as useful.

    In particular we assume a reductive model of the universe where complex behaviors can 
    be derived from simpler laws, we also accept evolution as the formative process that 
    created all life.  We assume that adpotion of the simplest explantation, empirical validation, 
    refutability, and predictiveness of findings about the world, are the gold standards used in judging their worthiness.

    Our first surprise is that many incompatibilies are actually an incompatibility between the traditional language of religious thought
    and our modern world view.  Once theological assertions are translated into this modern perspective the inconsistency is gone.

    Our second surprise is that most of the religious beliefs common to all religions are either plausible, or strongly supported by an application
    of the scientific method to what is commonly accepted about the world we inhabit.

    Often the reader may feel that this text wins its points on technicalities, becuase it defines terms in just the right way.
    We believe taken as a whole these new vocabulary and supported assertions consititute a significant shift in one world view.
    This view is neither simply the current scientific world view, nor a traditional religious perspective, but rather a new
    world view that supports many beliefs of the latter in a framework developed on the former.


    Those religious beliefs that differente world religions will in some cases also find some support or anti-support according to this
    perspective.
