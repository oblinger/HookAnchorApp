    ------------
    * Angular momentum exists at one level but not at lower level

    * Does there exist an entity that is beyond human understanding?
      - progressions have limit points beyond the progression itself, yet one can 
        best understand the progression as being controlled by that limit point.
        
    * did that entity create the universe?  create humanity?

    * is there an afterlife?

    * can there be eternal life? heaven, etc.  

    * should we believe that eternal life can be?

    * should we believe that humanity has divinely inspiried knowledge about the universe?
      - clearly it is consistent to believe this.  We have shown that evolution and humanity can be 
        programmed to result in such beliefs.  (DNA programming, gate programming of pac man)
      - The question is *Should* we belive it

    * If god does exist why doesnt he just "show up" and prove it?
      - first how would he do that?  what whould it look like if he did that?

    * what is the purpose of life?
      - what would an answer to that question look like?
        - different and different levels, and life would have no meaning at some levels, it would just be random.
      - indeed at the level of atoms there is no meaning to life.   But we know is exactly what we expect.  
        This in no way diminishes expectation for meaning at other levels!
      - The spirtual level seems to be a useful level to address that question.
        - At spiritual level what does our life on earth provide?  time and space for a persons inhrent nature to "unfold"


    * does God love us?

    * Do we go to heaven when we die?

    * What about reincarnation?
