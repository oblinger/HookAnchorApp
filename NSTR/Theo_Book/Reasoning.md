    Arguing for what exists:

    - Persons exist.  (by direct observation)

    SENTIENT AGENTS  --- Our observations support a "sentient agents" model with:
      - sentience
      - consciouness
      - existing over time as cohesive entity
      - will, thinking, internal representation of world, etc.

    MULTIPLE-MEs
      - no one really doubted the the sentient agent "me" exists, indeed the problem is the opposite:
      - it is not the only 'me' that I care about.
