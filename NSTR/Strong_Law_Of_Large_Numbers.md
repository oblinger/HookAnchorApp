# Strong\_Law\_Of\_Large\_Numbers --

    The law of averages


    Set S  where P(S)=1 where
    All x in S
       P[ All e>0  Exists N_e  such that   All n>n_e | 1/n Sum xi - E(x) | < e ] =1



    Strong hold for iid & finite varience

    Weak holds for 



    stationary:


    ergodic:  

       E(f(x))
