    "Sorry to have jumped the gun on this.  I should have checked with the group 
    first before scheduling the meeting.  But I know Martin online, so I jumped at 
    the chance to actually get to talk to him in person.  

    Anyway, I asked him to send stuff related to the project --- see below.

    Kontiki is still very new. We are at least two months away from being able to 
    write papers and stuff. However, I can certainly send you some of the 
    powerpoint presentations I used to get funding. I don't know if they make any 
    sense without me in the room talking and waving my hands, but they're the best 
    I have. I'm happy to answer any questions, either tomorrow or beforehand.

     (has a bunch of screenshots of the real prototype, this is the presentation 
    John Turek saw.)

    (mockups, plan given to Lotus 3 months ago)

    (original funding pitch)

    best,

    Hi.

    Do you have a paper, website, or anything on this that I could look
    at prior to our call on Wednesday?  I don't think you mean kontiki.com.
