    Set major mode for editing outlines with selective display. 
    Headings are lines which start with asterisks: one for major headings, 
    two for subheadings, etc.  Lines not starting with asterisks are body lines.  
     
    Body text or subheadings under a heading can be made temporarily 
    invisible, or visible again.  Invisible lines are attached to the end  
    of the heading, so they move with it, if the line is killed and yanked 
    back.  A heading with text hidden under it is marked with an ellipsis (...). 
     
    Commands: 
    C-c C-n   outline-next-visible-heading      move by visible headings 
    C-c C-p   outline-previous-visible-heading 
    C-c C-f   outline-forward-same-level        similar but skip subheadings 
    C-c C-b   outline-backward-same-level 
    C-c C-u   outline-up-heading            move from subheading to heading 
     
    C-c C-t make all text invisible (not headings). 
    C-c C-a make everything in buffer visible. 
     
    The remaining commands are used when point is on a heading line. 
    They apply to some of the body or subheadings of that heading. 
    C-c C-d   hide-subtree  make body and subheadings invisible. 
    C-c C-s   show-subtree  make body and subheadings visible. 
    C-c tab   show-children make direct subheadings visible. 
             No effect on body, or subheadings 2 or more levels down. 
             With arg N, affects subheadings N levels down. 
    C-c C-c    make immediately following body invisible. 
    C-c C-e    make it visible. 
    C-c C-l    make body under heading and under its subheadings invisible. 
                 The subheadings remain visible. 
    C-c C-k  make all subheadings at all levels visible. 
     
    The variable `outline-regexp' can be changed to control what is a heading. 
    A line is a heading if `outline-regexp' matches something at the 
    beginning of the line.  The longer the match, the deeper the level. 
     
    Turning on outline mode calls the value of `text-mode-hook' and then of 
    `outline-mode-hook', if they are non-nil.
