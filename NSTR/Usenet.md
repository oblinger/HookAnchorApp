# Usenet -- How to integrate approach with existing USENET groups

    GOALS
    - make larger community aware of the CONSENSUS net
    - don't bother plain usenet community
    - convenient to do both usenet and consensus at the same time


    SIMPLIFIED CONNECTION

    - Parent is defined by the 'reply' threading.  If a note has an explicit type then it
      serves as the parent of any direct reply to that message, otherwise direct replies 
      inherit the parent of this messsage.
    - Message type is explicitly expressed using the following format at the beginning of a line:
       preamble usenet post text that does not go in tree
       Support





    FORMAT FOR MESSAGE ORIGINATING ON USENET
    - Subject: <<>> 
    - Subject: Summary:    Title string
    - Subject: <<>>

    preamble text

    <<>>

    Design Points
    * Nodes can be associated with newsgroup.  Node contributors are
      prompted to ask if they should also be posted.

    * Posts can also serve as a consensus entry.
