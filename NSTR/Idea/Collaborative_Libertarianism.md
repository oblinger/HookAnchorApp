    PRINCIPLES
      * FEWEST RESTRICTIONS -- limitation on some freedom should only be considered when
        it limits actions that result in greater lost of other freedoms.
      * COLLABORATION INSPIRING MECHANISMS -- The societal interpretation of this 
        first principle is chosen so as to maximize tendencies toward voluntarally 
        joined organization that address societal issues important to the citezenry.


    SOCIETAL ISSUE TYPES
     * Direct liberty conflicts (e.g. murder) are governed by laws as today.
     * Minimum set of 'collective services' (e.g. military) covered by taxes as today.
     * Extended services are handled by voluntary organizations.  Laws provide support
       for the creation of these organizations.


    A PRIMARY CHALLENGE -- 
    * Some important societal problems require generosity since those affected do 
      not have the financial or other means available.
    * The citzens with the means (financial or otherwise) to resolve the problem
      are the only ones who should decide to use those means.
    * But this sets up a prisoner's dilemma:  


    Prisoner's Dilemma:
     
    Imagine 80 folks out of 100 people who would pay $1 to contribute the need $50 
    to solve some important issue.  But none could/would spend $50 to address it alone.

    Each of the 80 would be happy to pay a $1 to resolve the issue, but they do not
    do so, because they would be happyies it the other 50 pay a buck to resolve the problem.

    Rough translation: the 80, like most of us, want to voluntarily "do their part" but as
    they see it, but they don't want to be the first chump who reaches for their wallet.




    Each citizen has the option to choose to join (or create) a 'social good' collective.
    * Joining zero or more collectives is voluntary.
    * Rules governing a collective are determined by its constitution and updated by the group itself.
    * The group decides what which, how, and how much each social problem is to be attacked by the group.
    * Within a *very* controlled space the group also decides how it will financially interact with other groups.
      This INTERACTION mechanism is intended to foster collaboration that avoids the dilemma above, yet must
      be significantly constrained so it provides few opportunities for abuse.


    CONSTRAINTS ON LEGAL INTERACTION MECHANISMS:
     * A group can only dictate interaction policies on its members.  So group A can decide to provide a preferred trading status to group B
       and not to group C, but it has no ability to affect how other groups trade.
    *  A group may only have a trading policy that is a computable function of the difference between the 'giving' rate for itself and
       the other group in question.  I
