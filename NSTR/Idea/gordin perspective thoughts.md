# Idea.gordin perspective thoughts --



    Perspectives:
    #P1  All people understand the world from their own perspective
         (e.g. what they believe is important, relevant/irrelevant, and what are correct actions for themselves and others)

    #P2  *Some* people can recognize when their perspective differs from another's, but even when they
         can see this, in their heart they still "know" their perspective is the "correct" one.

    #P3  People seek a cohesive view of the world, and this tendency will drive them to prefer perspectives
         that support actions they have taken or are inclined to take.  (They generally don't believe
         they have this preference, rather they are adopting the perspective that is simply more "correct")


    Goals:
    #G1  Most people most of the time are primarily influenced by their own self centered goals 
         as they see those goals from their own world perspective 

    #G2  Additionally most people are influenced to a varying degree by their *OWN* assessment of
         benefits to others according to their *OWN* world perspective.

    #G3  Most Americans believe an individual's self-determination is supreme.  In this context
         it means that the individual is free to choose the perspective they adopt in evaluating the world.
         The individual is free to choose how much of #G1 verses #G2 goal reasoning they do.  The individual's
         only hard responsibility is to the laws of society.  All else is up for grabs.

    Refinements:
    #R1  Especially altruistic people will more frequently give #G2 greater weight then the rest
         us.  But all people engage in a mixture of #G1 and #G2.

    #R2  Especially broad minded people with be able to occasionally build crude models of others 
         peoples world perspectives, and use them as inputs to their own world perspective about
         that person.  (E.g.   I know that Dan frets much about getting credit for things, since
         I think such things are silly, I will make sure he is credited with the joint work we are
         doing.")


    I personally believe we should accept that this is the way others will always be, because we ourselves are that way too.
    I go further and say this state of affairs is "good" in that it is the way humans are "supposed" to be.
    It is the natural order of things.

    --- ask your self:  do you believe this is the way things are, and they way things should be?  ---


    Notice, that according to this characterization allmost everyone is *GOOD* to a large degree.
    Almost everyone believes they are "doing the right thing" almost all of the time.  
    If they engage in #G1 reasoning most of the time, they believe because of #G3 that they are 
    within their rights to do so, and further believe that they are not doing this more than the next guy.  
    They are just "being practical".  Some people even rise above this level of Goodness, as in #R1 and #R2 above.


    In apparent contrast to this "all are good" perspective, we see that some people *regularly* find really creative ways
    to *deliberately* screw others over.  I believe if you look at this behavior, most of the time you will find
    it is motivated by a combination of the first two of the following three effects:

    EFFECT #1
    The first is the "I am within my rights" reasoning.  They think that both they and the other person are free
    to strive for their own personal goals even if this negatively impacts the other's goals.  This is selfish reasoning.
    We often see this as the primary motivator when others are being "evil" according to our perspective.

    EFFECT #2
    A second effect is often in play, but is much harder for us to see, because we are inherently situated
    within our own perspective.  One person's assessment of what is desirable/appropriate may be radically 
    different from another's assessment.  So I may be royally screwing you over, but from my perspective
    these actions may be fully correct and good for you, or at least not really that bad for you, and fully within
    range of correct behavior for me.

    EFFECT #3
    Sometimes people are just bastards.  They believe an action is bad for another, and they just don't care.
    In my experience, it is very rare for a person to take an action that they believe is strongly detrimental
    for another.  Occasionally they do it because such action is strongly beneficial to themselves, but mostly
    they do it because they don't see it as strongly detrimental.


    MY ASSESSMENT OF ALL OF THIS
    ------------------------------
    Amazingly, everything from fights on the playground to thermonuclear wars are fought with only "good guys"
    on both sides.  Intrigue between lovers and the loved, or employees and others so employed are all 
    played out against a relativistic backdrop where everyone knows their own grey hat is one of the more 
    white hats in the room.  Just amazing!  Should we be heartened by the good nature inherent all, or depressed by
    the inevitability of the endless conflict that it implies?  Both I guess.

    Ok so let me bring this all back to *MY* perspective, how do I see things on a day to day basis?
    After all, like everyone else, this is the perspective I really believe the most.

    For me the realizations above give me a deep well of compassion for evil in others.  Evil action is almost never
    *meant* as evil by the doer.  If I see it as a very bad action, it often stems from a deficiency in that person (according to my perspective.)
    Perhaps their view of what is important is narrow it completely ignores what is really important (according to me).  
    Perhaps their own insecurities or other psychological problems make it hard for them to be honest with themselves
    about some subject.  Evil action is rarely meant as evil.  Really think about this, don't you agree?

    So I am not *happy* with a lot of things that a lot of people do.  They are not good actions.
    But from my smug, superior, "more enlightened than thou," point of view, neither are they 
    the actions of a bad person.


    So I invite you to join in ... together we can both share a smug, superior, "more enlightened than thou" perspective.
