    [COFFEE]

    You are in the right spot for good joe.

    My routine was to stop each morning at Cafe Borone'
    (<<>>) which is a stones throw from SRI (1010 El
    Camino Real between Santa Cruz Avenue and Ravenswood Avenue).  But I'm not
    sure if they have wireless -- they didn't when I was there.

    In Palo Alto, there was a great cafe' on California Avenue, next to a great
    bookstore.

    You probably know Tessa has moved into Palo Alto -- I'm sure she has mapped
    out the wireless scene.
