    Barbara
    * Right now:  cyc working on competative bid for seed.  generating API at my direction.  generating examples.
                  BAA being done at DARPA.
    * RFI + AAAI slides now out.    API+examples soon.
    * My general approach is to get details to *all* performers as I go.
      - Fair
      - allows me to keep working on these details as I near BAA.

    * I Plan to be quite explicit about factors affecting acceptance & constraints

    * I am using detailed example scenerios to guide performers.

    * Can I get examples from yolanda, & david.
      - I have defined set of examples.

    * Once BAA is out, I want to continue developing examples and APIs.
      - I plan to regularly post these to my solicitations page.
      - I plan to transition this activity to curriculum prime after source selection.

    * Once source-selection occurs, these activities will transition to curricula team
      (probably with Cyc being a sub to them)
      - will add API monitoring & infrastructure roles to curricula team

    * IP issues.

    * COTR
