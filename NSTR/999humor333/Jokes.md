    One day, there was a catastrophic event which caused all humans on Earth 
    to die. To sort things out, everyone went to Heaven. God came in and said, "I 
    want the men to make two lines. One line for the men who ruled their women 
    on earth and the other line for the men who were ruled by their women. 
    Also, I want all the women to go with St. Peter." With that, the next time 
    God looked, the women were gone and there were two lines. 
     
    The line of men who were ruled by their women was 1000 miles long, and in 
    the line of men who ruled their women, there was only one man. God became 
    angry and said, "You men should be ashamed of yourselves. I created you in 
    my image and you were all whipped by your mates. Look at the only one of 
    my sons who stood up and made me proud. Learn from him! Tell them, my son, 
    how did you manage to be the only one in this line?" 
     
    The man replied, "I don't know, my wife told me to stand here."

    Here's another on "wits playing on human nature": 
     
    It is said that King Henry IV of England 
    decided to ban the wearing of gold or jewelry 
    in the kingdom.  
     
    His advisors laughed behind his back concerning  
    the edict because they thought its enforcement impossible. 
     
    Then Henry had an idea. 
     
    He passed a second edict which exempted 
    all thieves and prostitutes from the first 
    ruling.
