    Developed applications based on novel Machine Learning algorithms across several areas including: - Mining human skill profiles from email traffic - Inducing executable system management scripts learned directly from microsoft windows event stream. - Learning to recognize speech <<>> reading disabilities from voice data. - Inducing predictive models of protein tertiary structure based on its underlying primary (DNA) structure. 

    PhD, Computer Science 1998
    Developed 'plausible inference' a method for inductive learning that is based on incorrect (but "Plausible") background knowledge expressed as a logical theory.
