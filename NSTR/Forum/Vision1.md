# Forum.Vision1 --

    VISION STATEMENT

    The vision of the forum is a medium that leverages the basic human desire to be heard and understood in order to
    produce an evolving exposition of interelated opinions and positions which comprise the space of human thought on topics of active interest.

    The Forum is a self-working mechanism that binds the "being heard" human motivator to the challenging task of carefully articulating consensus sub-positions, and
    clarifying their relation with other contrary positions.  On The Forum one can only be heard by first demonstrating that you have listened.



    ***********************************************
    ***  THE HUMAN TRAGEDY OF MISUNDERSTANDING  ***
    ***********************************************

    Great human, financial, and emotional costs result from misunderstandings.

    A number of factors collude to exacerbate this tragic human condition of perpetual misunderstanding:
    *  We each believe and build from a core set of assumptions.  We rarely question them, yet
       they are often the very things that untimately underly irreconsilable postions between people.
    *  Concerted open-minded discussion is required to uncover these points of departure.
    *  This needed discussion is at a minimum distasteful, since it requires on to reason beyond and about those
       assumptions that underly ones world view.
    *  The social/discussion outlets we have today either are a form of preaching to the choir, or are sound bite sized 
       salvos from one side of an argument, where neither side is motivated to probe the grey area that truly separates their position.
    *  Indeed many of the forums we have today merely reinforce the feeling among all sides that "we are right and the other side(s) are crazy"



    **************************
    ***  FORUM OBJECTIVES  ***
    **************************

    The vision of "the forum" is a new way of interacting which leverages many drivers employed by today's successful interaction mediums, but
    additionally drives participants to explore and clarify the space of opinions surrounding these topics of human interest.  
    By boiling away parts of our beliefs that are not supported, we come closer to those that do not hold those beiefs.  
    Alternatively, when a different in opinion boils down to a difference in assumptions which cannot be proven by either side, both
    sides gain a repect for the rationality of the alternative position--they aren't crazy, they simply don't hold this belief, a belief which I
    ultimately cannot prove beyond doubt.


    *  The forum seeks to capture and clarify the evolving space of human opinion on issues of interest.

    *  It is an electronic discussion that encourages fair and open debate to leading to the articulation of the web human opinion varients their support and their inter relations. 

    *  Draw on the basic human desire to illuminate others with ones own understanding to drive the work of clear articulation of positions, and of connecting them within the web of human thought.

    *  Provide a multi-layer summarization of thought on subjects of discussed by humanity.  This summarization should
       - Enable a casual observer to quickly retrieve a clear and unbiased articulation of the major positions on any topic of human interest
       - Immediately linked to each position are the most articulate and balanced supporting and opposing arguments for each, allowing the
         observer to quickly drill down into sub-areas and support/opposition of most relevant to their personal perspective on the issue.
       - The forum would be the place to go when one thinks.   "that is stupid, how could anybody ever think XXXX"
         with a few clicks you would have the best articulations of exactly why someone might think XXX.
         In its fullest form, the forum would be the appropriate place for mainstream media to go, when it wanted to report on
         what "the people think" about a given topic.

    * The output should be: 
      - Representative 
      - Concise 
      - Reliable 
      - Spin-Neutral 

    * Why should people want to do it? 
      - Want to be heard.
      - Want to contribute. 
      - Want to defent their position againt presented attacks.
      - They want to speak directly to those who dont see their perspective, because know they are "right." 



    ***************************************************************
    ***  PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE APPROACHES BEING CONSIDERED  ***
    ***************************************************************

    * MECHANIZED BRIDGE BETWEEN 'BY-TIME' (threaded) and 'BY TOPIC' (articulated) ORGANIZATIONS

    * LEVERAGE THE DESIRE TO BE HEARD

    * LEVERAGE THE SIMPLICITY OF A DISCUSSION


    * VIRAL

    * SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM AUTOMATIC SCAFFOLDIONG TO HUMAN EDITING



    * MECANISTIC.
      Mechanistic (and thus position neutral) processing. 
        Universal objective procedures applied uniformly to all positions on all issues. 
      ELIMINATE SOME FORMS OF BIAS BY BUILDING THE FORUM ON MATHEMATICALLY DEFINED OPERATIONS

    * GRAFTABLE

    * HETROGENEOUS -- Should 

    * NOT OWNED, NOT CONTROLLED

    * INCLUSIVE.
      Support (or opposition) on a submission only affects its promanence not its publication, all submissions are published. 

    * ONLINE INCREMENTAL ALGORHTM



    At its core the forum is a mathematically precise transformation algorithm which accepts a universe of message streams and produces
    an evolving articulation of human opinion.  Because it is a function that can be computed by anyone, the forum is owned by no one.  Multiple organizations
    can compute this function from the conversations occuring on the internet each producting the same articulation tree.



    **********************************
    ***  KEY TECHNICAL CHALLENGES  ***
    **********************************

    * AUTOMATIC METHODS OF STUCTURED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION
      - identification of the type of a message (e.g. supporting, opposing, declaring a position on an issue, etc.)
      - identification of the topic of a message (using keywords, shallow parsing, containing thread, and originating newsgroup/blog topic, etc.)
      - linking message into topic tree
      - segmenting message into chunks with a single pragmatic purpose (e.g. portion which is the statement of a position)

    * HCI ISSUES
      - The way information is presented will affect the semantics of the forum, thus precise choices must be articulated in the forum's contract.

    * DEFEAT GAMING OF THE SYSTEM -- All aspects of the forum must be designed to eliminate or minimize human gaming of
      the system to achieve personal ends at the expense of the objective of the forum.  These methods include:
      - Metrics designed to thwart gaming.  (for example, explicitly measuring bias as a function of the distribution of support and opposition for a message)
      - Algorithmic choices
      - Human vetting processses and mechanisms
      - Presentation choices

    * ANALYSES OF CONSEQUENCES

    * SPACE OF POLICY CHOICES

    * AUTHENTICATION
      - Figuring out
