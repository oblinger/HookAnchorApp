# MR.MR\_NOTES --

    MR is the only program (at DARPA or anywhere) that transforms text into a form that is 
    MACHINE processable.  

      Promise of machines navigating the human world centrally depends on this capability.

    MR is not easy, but is in range, and is the central to feeding dozens of revolutions in how computing
    is used.  

         Recommend funding program at level that both the science and the need require.


    The three leading subitted cover the waterfront of approaches being explored today

    Natural Text and Formal Knowlege are fundamentally and radically incompatible.
    Three radically different approaches to bridging this gap:

    BBN: Reasonging is best done at text level.  mapping to *any* always introduces uncertainty, and mismatch, so delay 'till end
    SRI: Constraints (K) come from many levels and can help constrain many other levels
    IBM: No unified K model is possible/desirable instead operate simultaneously over set of islands of local consistency
