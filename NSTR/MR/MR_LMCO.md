    PEOPLE:  Lyle Unger? (text mining leader??)   Tomek Strzalkowski (open NLP expert??)
    Clear Claims
    - Unsupervised convergence  (SPECTRAL,LSA,CCA)   (light on NLP?)
    - DISCOURSE/EVENT pattern mining?
    - CBS: context based similarity   (context base word categorizaton)
    - CCA:  multi-view learning  (many var HMM state)   focus on entity matching
    - Thread separation   (nice but only central for discourse texts)

    - Use of discourse analysis for phase I   (cool idea)


     !!! ith exception of some depth in discourse analysis, not sufficient strength in core NLP.
