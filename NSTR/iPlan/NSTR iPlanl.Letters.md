    Mr. and Mrs. Barsalote and Ma.aliramae:

    Thank you for your letter!  I look forward to hearing more about your family.
    You asked me about my family, so let me tell you about them.  I am not married yet, but I do
    have a friend in New York City.  I live in Washington DC, about 4 hours away by train.  
    I get to go to New York very often.  In DC, I live with my cat, Marty.  
    My parents live in Kentucky, about 2000 kilometers away.  And my brother lives in 
    Florida also about 2000 kilometers away.

    I work for the government in DC, and I work at the University of Maryland where I teach
    students about computers.  I will print out many pictures in my next letter so you can 
    see some of the poeple in my life.

    Thank you for writing me, and thank you for letting me write to you daughter too.

    Your Friend,

    Dan

    Hello XXXXX, 

    Very nice to meet you!  

    Thank you for the pictures that you have sent.  They are very nice.
    I am sending some pictures back to you too.  
    One picture is of my Mom's whole family.  I have put an arrow pointing to my Mom, 
    my Father, and me and my brother.  The other picture is just me, on a trip, and the last
    picture is me with my brother's daughter SAMI.  (Isn't Sami cute?)

    I grew up on a farm in Kentucky, but after school I went to work in Washington DC.
    That is where I live now.  I must get used to all of the people.  So many people live in 
    this city.
