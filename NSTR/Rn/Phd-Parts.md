    PHD-PARTS: Possible components of my thesis
    Motivation
    Formal model of plausible reasoning as inference
    -  Regularity compression hypothesis
    Model of plausible reasoning as induction
    Comparisons
    -   To other inductive techniques
    -   To non-monotonic reasoning techniques
        -  Generalization problem
    -   To contextual reasoning
    -   To expert systems
    Proof of concept
    -   Blocks world
    Applications
    -   Reasoning with simultaneous action
    -   2d non-rigid object design
    -   Finite element mesh construction
    -   Chaotic systems modeling
    Specializations
    -   Preference orderings on explanations
    -   Statistics of rule adoption.
    -   Parameter filling in analytic functions
    -   Bootstraping specialized knowledge from generalized knowledge
    -   Meta knowledge about accuracy of entire explanations
    -   How K. interacts (not just overrides)
    Results
    -   Soundness: only generates ``plausible'' hypotheses
    -   Completeness: Can learn any world given its plausible knowledge.
