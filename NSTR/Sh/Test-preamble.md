    DESCRIPTION 
           This  documentation  is no longer being maintained and may 
           be inaccurate or incomplete.  The Texinfo documentation is 
           now the authoritative source. 
     
           This  manual page documents the GNU version of test.  Note 
           that most shells have a built-in command by the same  name 
           and with similar functionality. 
     
           test  returns  a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending 
           on the evaluation  of  the  conditional  expression  expr. 
           Expressions may be unary or binary.  Unary expressions are 
           often used to examine the status of  a  file.   There  are 
           string operators and numeric comparison operators as well.
