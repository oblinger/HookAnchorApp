    [GOAL] 
    - Support distributed software development in a way that rewards sharing. 
     

     
    [PRIMARY DETERMINATIONS] 
     
    Agrigate pricing model.  Three primary decisions: 
    #1 What is the approapriate total revenue? 
    #2 What percent should be paid to a given package author? 
    #3 What percent should a given user pay? 
     
     
    #1 Voted on in a weighted users poll. 
     
    #2 Voted on in a weighted poll of users. 
     
    #3 This metric should not discourage or limit use of the software. 
    -  This can be accomplished by keeping the cost per user below the benefits 
       obtained by that user. 
    -  This implies that collaborative work will necessarily be under funded 
       relative to the optimal allocation strategy. 
    -  Estimation of user utility is based on a per seat usage model and on 
       a company revenue model. 
       -  
     
     
     
    - Categories should maximize info gain. 
      (Seperate users from non-users) 
    - Cost structure should mirror differences across categories. 
     
    [ESTIMATION METHODS] 
    - After a product announcement.  Offer software to non-buyers at various 
      discounts (even free).  Use this to measure the demand curve. 
      STEEP   ==> Price should be lower. 
      SHALLOW ==> Category is not pure.
