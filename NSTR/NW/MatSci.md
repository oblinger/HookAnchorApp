    FROM TOM TEIS
    My summary of our primary overlap is:
    - Polymer Chemistry
    - Functional Genomics, comp bio, and bioinformatics.    Prof. Hatzimanikatis == CBC under Ajay Royurru  (I know other comp bio as well)
    - Better overlap with MatSci and Eng Dept.
       Inorganic systems work is more directly applicable here.
