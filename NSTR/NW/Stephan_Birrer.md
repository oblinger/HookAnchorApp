    "Hi Dan

    To follow up our conversation, I send you my CV electronically.

    Is this the kind of paragraph you are looking for (research interest):

    My research interest spans the intersection between distributed systems
    and networking. My research model is mainly experimental - designing,
    building, testing and redesigning as a way of gaining further insights
    into complex systems.

    Recent projects address efficient overlay mechanism for group
    communication specifically focusing on highly dynamic environments.
    Example applications, which benefit from this research, are online
    gaming, video conferencing and content distribution.
