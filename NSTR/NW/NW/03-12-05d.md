    "Hi, Daniel,

    Thank you for meeting with me today. It is a great pleasure to talk to you
    and John and to know more about IBM research lab.
    I am impressed by the research you've been doing and the research
    atmosphere of your research team. As we discussed, my experience in
    algorithm and protocol design will be valuable to some of your research
    projects.

    Looking forward to hearing from you again.  Please contact me if I can
    provide more information.
    Attached is an electronic version of my resume.
    Thank you very much!
