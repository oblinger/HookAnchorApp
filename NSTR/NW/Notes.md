# NW.Notes --



    Peijuan, 

    I just met with John Turec and he mentioned about you and your interest in our lab.  Can you send me your resume?  I can help to forward it to our managers and we can try to have a faster interview process.  

    Thanks.

    Peijuan,
    I took the liberty reviewing your resume that you sent out earlier. Your
    research interests and working experiences appear to have a good match with
    some of our projects here in CRL. I am forwarding your resume to some of
    the hiring managers, I trust that you will hear from some of them pretty
    soon.

    John,
    Thanks for your support. Really appreciate that.

    Dong, Hong, Jing-min, Ying, Wei,
    Please take a look of Peijuan's resume and take appropriate follow-up.
    Thanks.
