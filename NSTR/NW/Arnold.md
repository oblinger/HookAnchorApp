    #1.  Band gap photobleaching in isolated single-walled carbon nanotubes
         - study light emission in nano-tubes
         - optical amplifier; optical properties
         (early work on seperation based on size and chirality using light)

         - optical gain is within one order of magnitude of the loss  (needs to be greater for lazing)

    #2. (Strippable) Insolated nanotubes.
        New ways to non-covalently electrical isolate
