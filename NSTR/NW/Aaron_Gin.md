    Dr. Oblinger,

        I just wanted to drop you a quick note and thank you for meeting with 
    me today at Northwestern University.  It was nice to meet you and briefly 
    discuss my research topic, which roughly entails the fabrication and
    characterization of nanometer-scale optoelectronic devices.  I also
    appreciate your offer to pass along my resume to those who might be
    interested in my skills, and I would be happy to explain to you or others 
    at IBM the details of this research.  In particular, I performed a quick
    search on individuals doing nanoscale science at IBM and came up with a
    few names:

    Robert D. Miller, IBM Almaden Research Center
    Kenneth R. Carter, IBM Almaden Research Center
    K. H. Yang, T.J. Watson Research Center
    Bruno Michel, Zurich Research Laboratory

        Of course, I would be happy if you could pass my resume on to others
    at IBM who may have a need for someone with my experience.  Additionally, 
    if you would like to take a look at some of my journal publications, I
    have posted them at:

        Thanks again for meeting with me, and I appreciate your interest in
    my future job placement.  Have a nice day.

    Best regards,

    Aaron Gin
