    "Dear Dr. Oblinger,

    This is Sotirios Tsaftaris from Northwestern.  Thank you for meeting me on
    a very short notice, on Tuesday, the 5th of October.

    I promised to send you a copy of my CV and resume accompanied by a cover
    letter.
    Please accept my apology for my late submission, but I was away for a few
    days at a workshop that I found out about last minute

    I am attaching the above documents.  Per our discussion, I assume you will
    review them and forward them to colleagues that will be interested in my
    research and experience.
    I also wanted to remind you that I am highly interested in a Summer
    Internship as well.

    Please acknowledge the receipt of this email and keep me updated on future
    developments.

    If you need any more information, please either call me at 847.219.6562 or
    email me at s-tsaftaris@northwestern.edu.
    Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

    Sincerely,


    Sotirios A. Tsaftaris
