    IRL  - hi perf comp.


    an,

        Thank you for your help. Priyanka is our new staffing person. She would be a good general contact for students interested in IRL. In case students have specific queries, please feel free to refer them to me. 

        I would say that the difficulty in getting hired here is comparable to that in IBM Watson. So, if you come across such students who are interested in coming back to India, please refer them to us. 

        I forgot to mention that I also met Prof. Jorge Nocedal at NWU. He was remembering you.

    thanks,
    best regards,
    Rahul..
