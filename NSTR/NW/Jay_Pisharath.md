    This is Jay, I met with you on October 6. I hope you remember the project
    that I mentioned -- characterization of data mining applications (also their
    parallel and distributed versions). I work on computer architectures,
    parallel computing and data mining algorithms.

    As per your suggestion, I'm attaching a cover letter and my CV to this
    email. To help you with ciruculating my CV within IBM, these are the few IBM
    people whose papers/work I have definitely used for our study:

    Rakesh Agrawal
    Philip Yu
    Ramakrishnan Srikant
    Manish Mehta
    Sholom Weiss
    Charu Aggarwal
