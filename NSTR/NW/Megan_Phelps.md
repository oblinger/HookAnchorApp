    I apologize for not getting back to yesterday. The below explains our relationship with Northwestern as an 'Other' level school.

    We have 83 schools that are classified as Level 1 and 2 schools, all of which are our IBM investment schools. These colleges and universities have proven hiring success with IBM which is why we focus our time and resources on them. The University Recruiting and Relations (URR) team has 10 representatives that manage the recruiting and relationships at approximately 8-10 of these investment schools. The URR Managers initiate and attend campus recruiting activities and maintain the relationship between IBM and the schools. 

    We also have approximately 40 schools that are classified as Level 3 schools, in which University Recruiting and Relations provides relationship support for the school on a very limited basis.  I am the representative for these schools.  We tend limit our activity to scheduling events for these schools based on the manager's business need. The managers initiate any additional campus activity outside the services I provide (mainly setting up dates on campus and equipping you with the resources you need prior to campus). We prefer managers to go to a Level 1 or 2 IBM investment school if building relationships unless there is a specific business need to attend one of out Level 3 schools (i.e. proximity to a site, a special educational program offered at that school, etc.). 

    This spring, BCS hosted one Interview Day at Northwestern at the beginning on March.
