    Thanks for giving me the chance to speak about my research work and the 
    possible opportunities at IBM research. I had a quick look at the IBM research 
    web site and found a couple of areas that are fairly close to what I have in 
    mind as my future job (in the Nanotechnology division). I will try to take a 
    more in-depth look to see if I can come up with the names of individuals who do 
    these works.
