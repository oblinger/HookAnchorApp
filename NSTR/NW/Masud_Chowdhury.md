    - component-level Interconnect circuit issues
      capactive coupling, signal integritey, inductive effects, scalability of noise

    - realizable reduction of extracted circuit netlist

    - signal intergity and noise in digital circuits
      as interconnects shrink causes coupling: capacitance, inductive effects
      may destroy:  timing or logic

    Thesis:
    Built delay model for interconnect delay as function of parasitic elements  (induction, capacitance, resistance) which are obtained 
    by modeling VLSI layout on substrait 

    - Analytically derived, physically verified.
