    Catalua an NorthWestern  (tutorial  joint A/V)



    indeed, we have put an NSF proposal together with Nortwestern U. and
    University of Colorado, currentlt under consideration by NSF ("ITR
    Collaborative research: Audio-visual interaction in non-ideal
    environments"). We expect to know about its state in Sept.  I mainly have
    been interacting  with Profs. Katsaggelos and Pappas  from the ECE dept. on
    that one. They are both interested in audio-visual speech, mainly ASR and
    synthesis, and thus we have quite a few common interests. Involved in the
    proposal is also Prof. Garstecki with the Hearing and Audiology dept. of
    Northwestern Univ.

    In addition, we are at the very early stages of preparing a tutorial/course
    to be presented (subject to achieving sufficient registered attendees) at
    the upcoming ICIP03 in Barcelona, Spain, on "Audio-visual signal
    processing".

    To answer to your question, I am indeed interested in sharing with you the
    responsibilities of the relationship with NWU. No problem with traveling
    every
    now and then there.  Concerning a phone conversation, I am currently in
    Greece, trying to finish my belated Greek army draft assignment. I will be
    back
    to the US (at IBM) on July 21st. In the meantime, I am available most
    evenings at IBM Athens (that corresponds to your 10am-2 pm time), as during
    the day I spend time in the navy base. We can set a time for such a
    conversation, depending on your schedule, and I can send you a number that
    you can reach me.
    You can also try me at my cell-phone 1-914-309-6156, but pls have in mind
    that Greece is ahead + 7hrs.
