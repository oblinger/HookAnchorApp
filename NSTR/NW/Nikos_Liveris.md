    Area:  
     - CAD, VLSI design, bus protocall design
     - platform design  (like CoreConnect)
     - AdvHiPerf cpu bus protocall, lower power design


    @# Find CoreConnect 
    - Used AMBA bus protocall (applied optimizations for low power)     (Robert Dick)
    - Wondering if this will apply to core connect.




    Similar to IBM protocal:  CoreConnect 
    Platform integration
