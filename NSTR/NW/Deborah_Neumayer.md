    I have connections with the Chemistry Department, and Materials Science Department at Northwestern.  Primarily with my old thesis advisors, Tobin Marks and Bruce Wessels.  I have not traveled to Northwestern in recent history, but was an inivited speaker at an ACS meeting honoring Tobin a couple years ago.

    Northwestern is planning a big shindig for Tobin's 60th birthday in November of 2004 and I have been approached to help organize this event.
