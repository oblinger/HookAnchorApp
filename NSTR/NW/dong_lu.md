    AREA: 
    - Empirical Queing models.  Server side of p2p system.   scheduling algs added to gnutella;e-donkey
      SRTP (shortest remaining transfer time)
      - Look at queueing performance as function of estimation performance.
    - Overlay Networks
      - GRID <<>> ?autonomic computing?
        - build distributed info service -- replicate info using overlay multicasts
          (50-60K lines; he wrote 30%)
        - wrote GridG random distributed network generator
    - Automonic Computing
      - Fat Nemo:  bandwith optomized overlay multicast protocall   (dong's contribution; auto-configure fat tree based approach)
        Emulates a fat tree as an overlay  (auto build fat tree; rebuild as nodes leave)
      - How many parallel tcp stream can you set up without affecting cross traffic
      - Multi-torrent (like bit-torrent, but better net structure (hierarchy based on capacity; incentives to handle non-collaborative agents)

    - Virtualized Audio.  (10-20K lines) -- Extract sound sources from mixture & then insert into simulated space
    - Web server scheduling
    - Connection servicing in multi-cast 
      Build multi-cast system using end nodes

    <<>> Strong w. respect to those FabianBustementa knows at IBM

    Dina:  Diverse pubs.  Real talent for diving into literature coming up w. novel soln.
           not afraid of theory, but with a real experimental strain.
           makes progress on his own.
           most analytic of the group   (dinda is not theoretical)
           easily my most productive student.  Very independent, very focused, 


    ------ SUMMARY
     
    Autonomic computing related
    (1)     MultiTorrents: A P2P file sharing system that is self-organized, self-configured, self-healing and very scalable and efficient. The peers are organized into a hierarchical hybrid tree structure with strong peers closer to the source. Strong incentives mechanisms are built into the systems such that a selfish peer has incentives to contribute more and follow the system protocol. (Paper in submission; available upon request)
    (2)     FatNemo: An overlay multicast system based on the idea of fat-trees. It is also self-organized, self-configured, self-healing and efficient. (WCW 2004; long version in submission)
    (3)     Modeling and Taming parallel TCP: automatically determine the proper number of parallel TCP flows to use, to achieve good performance without disturbing (much) cross traffics. (IPDPS 2005)
    (4)     Monitoring and Predicting TCP throughput: In addition to a novel TCP throughput benchmarking technique, we developed a dynamic sampling rate algorithm to automatically determine the optimal sampling rate depending on the path dynamics.  (ICDCS 2005)
    (5)     Power-aware reputation system in wireless ad-hoc networks: We build a reputation system to effectively support power-aware routing algorithms in an un-trusted, selfish ad-hoc network. The systems is fully distributed and self-configured. (ICC 2005)
     
     
    Empirical queuing <<>> empirical networking systems analysis
    (1)     SRPT scheduling with inaccurate job size information: we study the performance of SRPT scheduling as a function of correlation between estimated job sizes and actual job sizes. (MASCOTS 2004)
    (2)     P2P systems server side scheduling: we applied the SRPT scheduling on several popular P2P systems with the support of effective job size estimator. (LCR 2004; long version in submission)
    (3)     Domain based web server scheduling: we developed a domain based estimator to effectively utilize size-based scheduling (such as SRPT). (In submission)
     
    Grid computing
    (1)     Decentralized relational Grid Information service: we built a distributed and replicated information service on Oracle9i. Weak consistency is kept among the servers with overlay multicast. Several automatic query rewriting technique were developed to trade off the query time with the size of results set. (One paper in Supercomputing 2003; one paper in Grid 2003; One journal paper in submission. The parallel TCP and single TCP work, and the FatNemo work mentioned in Autonomic computing section also can be listed here)
    (2)     GridG: An extensible graph generator and annotator. Several research groups are using the tool. GridG can generate graphs that follow that power laws of internet topology and has a clear hierarchical structure. GridG also can annotate the routers, links, host machines with sensible, correlated attributes. (One paper in Supercomputing 2003; toolkit released online)
     
    Parallel Computing
    Virtualized audio: We use a parallel Linux cluster to solve a 3D wave function using finite difference methods. (LCR 2002)
     
    Wireless Networking
          Power-aware reputation system: We build a reputation system to effectively support power-aware routing algorithms in an un-trusted, selfish ad-hoc network. The systems is fully distributed and self-configured. (ICC 2005)

    "Dear Daniel,

    Merry Christmas and happy holidays!

    I have some update on my CV (two more papers accepted this month;
    complete reference list). I attached my current CV in the email for your
    review. Thank you.
