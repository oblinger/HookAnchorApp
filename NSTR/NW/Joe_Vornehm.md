    "Hi Dan,

    We met last month when you visited Northwestern University.  I'm a Ph.D.
    student in the ECE Department here.  My research is in the general area of
    experimental quantum computing, although I have a background in computer
    engineering and wireless communications.  I will be looking for a full-time
    job in the 2008 time frame, and we discussed potential career paths.  I
    appreciated the time you spent with me -- the future is a big place, as they
    say, and you've helped give some definition to it.  I've attached my updated
    resume, as well as a picture of myself to help jog your memory.

    My current intention is to continue to pursue quantum computing through
    experimental and theoretical work, particularly involving photonics and
    atomic optics.  I am currently working on the experimental side of things,
    but I feel I bring a fairly strong aptitude for theory to the table as well.
    Although it comes off sounding cliched, my main assets are that I'm a
    quick learner and I work well with other people.  If I had to choose one
    thing that sets me apart from the people I work with, it would probably be
    that when I am presented with a new situation or a new concept, I can fairly
    quickly gain insight and make a contribution.  I also have extremely
    well-honed C and MATLAB programming skills from a former life, but that
    tends to be less of an asset in my current field.

    I've found a project at Almaden that is fairly closely matched to the work I
    do here in the lab.  I can't seem to find anything other than the
    one-paragraph blurb on the Web, particularly whether the project is actively
    being pursued and who is working on it.  Here is the URL, in any event:
    <<>>  We are doing
    similar things in our lab.  We use neutral rubidium atoms in a purely
    magneto-optical trap instead of barium ions in an electro-magneto-optical
    trap, and we are aiming for inter-gate communication via teleportation
    rather than computational gates, but the principles are very much the same.
    I work with a vapor cell instead of a trap, but I am familiar with our
    trap experiment, and the experiments are virtually identical otherwise.
    When you visited, we also talked about the possibility of working with the
    Bennett group, but we both agreed that isn't as close a match to my current
    research.

    I am definitely interested in some sort of summer exchange or internship
    outside of the university.  Unfortunately, for this upcoming summer, I don't
    believe I could convince my advisor to let me go; unless someone at IBM
    feels that I would be an exceptional match for a particular group, I think
    it would be best to pursue an internship a couple of years from now.  That
    would also allow some time for my technical expertise to mature, as I've
    only been working in this area for a year now.

    I look forward to staying in touch as my studies progress.  Thanks again for
    your time.

    Joe Vornehm
