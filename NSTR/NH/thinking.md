    ---------------------
    MULTIPLE HIERARCHIES

    - Info can be situated in several hierarchies.
    - Should be able to create note, and later add it to such 
      hierarchies.
    - Each hierarchy is a tree (non-overlapping children)

    * Add "Gorby paper" filed in cabinet to relevant topic category list


    ---------------------
    CASES
    - many version of same document.

    Attach into the tree

    - How to archive notes in order to reuse the note name
    - line oriented list processing



    --------------------
    The X idea:
     - Info is organized by 'name'
     - Info is organized by 'category'  (each notester sub-branch can count as a category)
     - Info is organized by 'time'
     Views:  
       by name (the traditional view; plus a partial tree veiw)
       by time
         selected sub-category
         selected time range
       by tree
