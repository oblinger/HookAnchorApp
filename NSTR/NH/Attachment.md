    - isInDefaultDir()  just checks equality.   ????  
    - if in default then move file
    - allow user to move attachment.
    - use file browser to set dir

    - Create attachment always generates error msg when creating attachment.
    - when moving tree attachemnt dir should move
    - when changing directory attachemnts should move
    - attachment should overwrite is old attach is there?

    ? allow external attachments when directory is set?
