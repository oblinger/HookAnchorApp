    GOT STUFF
    (0)   No time to think right now                           -->  TAB-Q-Q type text
          No project, no action, not referenced                -->  TAB-Q-N type text
    (1)   Does it requires ACTION in the future?               -->  add it to a   TODO LIST
    (2)   Should it be retained for REFERENCED indefinitely?   -->  add it to the REFERENCE MATERIAL
    (3)   Otherwise                                            -->  add it to an  INFO LOG
    CREATION  -  I have some information I want to file away and ....
       EXISTING PROJECT  -  The information is associated with an existing project and ...
          CREATE CHILD  -  The added information is woven into the current project structure
             TAB-Q-C, just <<>> link manually
          SUB PROJECT  -  The information forms a new sub-group, with associated directory and todo items etc.
             TAB-Q-S creates a sub project with its directory under the super project's directory.
                     creates a note whose parent is super project.
          LOGS  -  The information does not form a new sub-group, nor does it fit the existing strucutures.
             TAB-Q-L
             TAB-Q-M
       NEW PROJECTS
          TAB-Q-P



    TODO LIST
    - If time is critical, just add enough text to the scratch list to remember item later today.
    - Decide what priority and/or due date is appropriate, add prefix as appropriate
    - Decide what the first action on this item will be, and add that list's one char identifier
    - If item is relevant to a existing or new project, then add that project's trigger word
      followed by a ":" character.
    - Finally write descriptive phrase for task.
    - If more info is needed it can be cut-pasted or written into item's note body.

    REFERENCE MATERIAL
    - 'Goto' trigger word associated with the info.
    - Add information relative to that reference word

    LOGGED INFO  TAB-Q-L
    - Select relevant log.
    - If trigger word is relevant, add it.
    - Title info if appropriate.
    - Enter information.



    REFERENCE MATERIAL
    The goal here is to add information in one context, in a way that it can be
    easily found in all other relevant contexts, but is not "in the way" when it is not
    needed.  The solution to this problem is a two-level retrieval based on trigger words.

    * In all context, there are is one or possibly two trigger words that associate with
      the relevant information.  So the user 'Goes to' that trigger word.
    * All information relvant to that trigger word is associated with that note
      in a way that is navigable locally from that trigger note.

    This two-level retrieval method ensures that tens of thousands of ad-hoc topics can be
    quickly created, and reliably and quickly retrieved.  

    TRIGGER WORDS -- Trigger words are central to this approach.  These words must separate
    the user's knowledge into thousands of distint categories, so that the knowledge organized
    around a each trigger yields a manageable local web of information.  Secondly and these
    words must be the first word the user thinks of in *all* contexts where a piece of information
    is needed.

    The first goal is easily attained by the words and phrases of natural human language.
    The number of proper nouns we all know, provide a very large vocabulary for organizing
    the user's world into many thousands of distinct categories.

    The second goal of being the *first* word the user thinks of is more challenging.
    The problem is that if we choose a trigger sufficiently distinct to index a single
    piece of information, that word or phrase may not come to mind when the info is needed.
    There will be too many varients that could have been used.

    So we must nominate a smaller set of trigger words for indexing.
    These words just get us "in-the-ballpark," and these words are so general that they
    will connect with the info regardless of the mental context we are in when we need the info.
    - PROPER NAMES.  If the info is strongly connected to a single proper name, then that
      name can serve as a great trigger word.  So, info relating to a person or a corporation
      is well served in this way.  Notice this trigger word index very different info about that
      person/corporation.  Don't worry, once you get to the node 'verizon' you will easily know
      which links to follow to get to your passwords for verizon online, and those for your
      financial records and account number, your recent discussions with tech support, etc.
    - PROJECT NAMES.  For any collection of stuff that I think of as a group 
    - I divide my world up into a set of projects (and subprojects)
      the number of these projects is small enough that I can remember the trigger
      word for each.  I cannot enumerate these words, but I don't need to
      I just need to be able to remember the word, whenever I need information about that 
      project.  If there is part of a project that become.

    * Trigger words are ideal for this purpose.  A trigger word is a memorable word (or
      phrase) that will come to mind when this information is needed.
    * Effective trigger words must be oversimplified, they cannot contain enough information

      to uniquely name the material.  Rather it is the single most
