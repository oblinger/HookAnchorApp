    ALGORITHM DETAIL:  
      INPUT/OUTPUT DATA:  Often the slide itself shows an idealization of in&out data.  if so, 
          on a backup slide, or in slide notes, we need examples of *ACTUAL* data.
      STEPS:  Algs are often best understood by showing an example application of the alg with visual 
          representation of the input, intermediate, and output data.  When possible some aspect of the
          alg itself is suggested visually as well.

    GO-NO/GO DETAIL:
      METRIC:  The exact metric used should be on a slide or backup slide.
      PROTOCOL:  The exact protocol used should be on a slide or backup slide.
      RAW DATA:  As much as feasible we should have backups showing raw data, or at least 
          a sampling of that raw data use in the go/no-go test.


      be available.  

    SLIDE NOTES:  Use these heading (in bold) to tell the story for the slide if presenter is not there:
      SUMMARY:  Sequence of phrases that capture intent of slide (if not expressed on the slide)
      XXXXX:    Notes for some aspect of the slide 'xxxx' is just given that title in the notes section
                followed by few short sentence of detail.
