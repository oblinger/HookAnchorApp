    POSSIBLE PROJECTS 
    ================= 
      DOCUMENTATION     -- Documemtation retrieval 
      - Patent server 
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
    Document Retrieval Problem -- help user find relevant docs 
    - help desk assistant 
    = Using query context (from query sequence) 
    = Global-local tree navigation 
    = Thesaurus-based query refinement 
     
    Taxonomy Population -- given a taxonomy associate docs to nodes 
    - Ency Britannica data merging 
     
     
     
     
    ---------- STREAM OF CONSIOUSNESS ------- 
     
    Use adaptive.   
    ! Generalize using thesarus. 
    ! Learn term translation probabilities 
      - learn term tuple translations 
      -  
     
    Clever tell most referencial pages 
     
    ! Can I glean other info from web structure/page structure 
      - eg. taxonomy of clever nodes from page link structure 
     
    !Use clever to find nodes, then build hierarchy from scratch. 
     
    !Think of web as having treelets that are broken pieces of 
     a single tree of knowledge.  
     - Graph Of Knowledge (GOK) is a possibly cyclic specialization tree of  
       concept nodes. 
     - A treelet is a set of pages that coorespond to a contiguous sub-graph 
       of the GOK where the structure of the pages mimic the structure of  
       the GOK, and the topics of each page corresponds to their corresponding 
       GOK topics. 
     - Induce the GOK that maximizes the number of highly match treelets on the 
       web.
