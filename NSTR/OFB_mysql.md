# OFB\_mysql --






    You're up and running, I think.  Database 'do', password 'Kad3eijo',
    wordpress/mysql username 'oblinger'.  I can change any of those that are a
    problem.

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE do;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)

    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON do.* TO oblinger@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'Kad3eijo';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.29 sec)
