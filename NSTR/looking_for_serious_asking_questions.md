# looking\_for\_serious\_asking\_questions --


    ok, so Kumusta is really the only Tagalog word I know, so I guess it is kind of false advertising to use it, but is seems nice to say hello that way.

    Well all of my friends would tell you that I am a guy that can be trusted -- I will just have to prove that to you.

    I am looking for my life partner -- someone I am well matches with physically, emotionally, and intellectually.

    your profile doesn't tell me much  (anything!) about yourself or your life.  so I guess I will need to do some asking here.  If you are interested in me then I will love to hear your answers.
