# Howto.SmallSupplies --

    I was curious myself and asked Juerg about your Staples order. He said to go into EA2000 , go to non travel expenses, and the category tab labeled office supplies. There is a limit you can spend, which should be listed there. He thinks it is prob $50-75. hope that answers your question
