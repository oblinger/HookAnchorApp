    END THE WEB CONFERENCE

      After the Web Conference has completed, all moderators should be sure to end their
      Web Conference.  Ending a Web Conference disconnects all users, and stops all
      associated usage charges at that time.  A meeting can even be ended earlier than
      its scheduled duration to save on conference related costs.
