    ADVANTAGES
    We just do *something*
         (only way to have product?)
    Someone w. experience is getting funding etc.

    DISADVANTAGES
    Less ownership <<>> Less credit
    Less individual freedom of direction

    THOUGHTS
    Simply not attempt to convince the others
    Is anyone going to fund before proven &and will a manager help us prove it?
