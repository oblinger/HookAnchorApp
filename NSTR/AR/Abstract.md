    Learning Computer Administration By Demonstration

    Personal computers and personalized computing environments have become an indispensable tool.  They are also nightmare to administer and maintain for individuals and organizations.  Expertise regarding how to perform various configuration or diagnostics procedures is scarce, costly, and valuable lore.  I will present a programming by demonstration approach for automatically capturing procedures executed on the Windows desktop.  Our approach recognizes common subsequences between multiple traces of the same procedure, and grafts these alternate paths onto a growing representation of the whole procedure.  Sophisticated sequence alignment algorithms have been developed for aligning biological sequence data, among others.  We have extended an HMM (hidden markov model) learning algorithm from this field for use in this task.  Our extension is greatly increases the complexity of the model since we must also learn action and branch rules for each of our steps.  The goal is to output a procedure represented as a graph of steps along with induced rules for action at each step.  I will show preliminary results in this direction.  This project was awarded three years of "adventurous research" funded at IBM.  I will briefly discuss the nature, advantage, and constraints of research in an industry lab.

    Learning Computer Administration By Demonstration

    - Personal computers and personalized computing environments have become an indespensible tool.
    - They are also nightmare to administer and maintain for individuals and organizations.

    - Expertise regarding how to perform various configuration or diagnostics procedures is scarse, costly, and valuable.

    - We present a programming by demonstration approach for automatically capturing procedures executed 
      on the Windows desktop.  

    - Our approach recognizes common subsequences between multiple traces of the same procedure and graft these
      alteranate paths onto a growing representation of the whole procedure.

    - Sophisticated sequence aligment algorithms have been developed for aligning biological sequence data, among others.

    - We have extended an HMM (hidden markov model) learning algorithm from this field for use in this task.
      Our extension is greatly increases the complexity of the model since we must also learn action and branch
      rules in each of our steps.

    - The goal is to output a procedure represented as a graph of steps along with induced rules for action
      at each step.

    - I will show preliminary results in this direction.

    - This project was awarded three years of "adventerous research" funded at IBM.  I will briefly discuss
      the nature, advantage, and constraints of research in an industry lab.
