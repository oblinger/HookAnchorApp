    Guided Eploration System (GES)  Bob Easton    <<>> - a way to standardize and capture proc 
    Neil Keller (works for BE) - person to talk to.  GES are pre-authored "cards".  Our work might feed 
    these. 
     
    Colin Malone - leads Linux client effort.  Common offering for whole company, C40B. 
     
    Potential customers:  IGS "administration" - setup, test, apply patches - anything done repetitively.   
     
    John Wallachy - going to make "us" an on-demand business.  Wireless, client, storage.  PW could help to 
    standardize/automate. 
     
    Seventeen deskside support people that support Hawthorne and Yorktowne.  Can dictate to them. 
     
    Relationship manager for BTCIO and Global Services internal account (18,000 people) 
     
    Would like to move beyond deskside support onto end-user support.   
     
    Want more automation, and reduce the number of configurations that are stored. 
     
    Interest waning on AIX, growing on Linux, huge on Windows.  Over 9,000 people using Linus. 25-30% in  
    Haifa, 10-15% here.  Windows is the sweetspot. 90%+ of clients.  Servers mostly AIX, moving to Linux,  
    some Windows. 
     
    ISSI - one button install.  Looks for pre-reqs.  Attempt to automate install.  Recently updated printers. 
    Gotten a fair number of calls.  10 people working fulltime for 2 weeks to upgrade printers.  Next 
    virus.   
     
    Kevin Jessup - IGS.  Dave Koeller - here.  Contact people.
