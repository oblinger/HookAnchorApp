    Julie,
    There is a very interesting project in Research called "personal wizards".   It allows a user to perform a series of actions in Eclipse, and records these actions, creating a script that can be replayed.   But upon replay, it can notice that the current environment is different than the original recording, and take appropriate action.  So, for example,  if several steps in the original recording of the script was to open cvs to copy a file into the user's workspace, and the second time the script is run, it is detected that the file already exists on the users workplace, it will automatically skip the steps relating to copying the file.  The script will automatically proceed to the right place in the script after the copying is complete, and continue on in the procedure.  This is really cool, but even more than that, the system will now understand that this script may be run sometimes when the file already exists in the workplace, and sometimes it needs to be copied from cvs.  So it will automatically generate a new generalized script to check which option exists.  You can continue to run this script in multiple environments/situations, and it will continue to generalize the script appropriately.  In addition to all this, they have a unique feature that shows you, in graphical detail, as you run the script what actions need to be taken next as it relates to your environment (e.g., think of documentation that says "now push the X button" and shows you where the button is in a picture-- but you don't have a button in that position on your desktop.   They can rather show where that button is on your desktop.)  There are other features but hopefully this gives some insight into the sort of technology they are creating.  

    I thought that this technology might be useful to System House.   For instance, it could help create robust scripts for deploying our systems.   Second, it could help customers customize scripts we provide to their environment.   So, for example, we might want to ship them not just the script, but this new engine, and allow them to customize steps based upon their unique environment.   Another option would be to use this tool to record where scripts we deliver fail, and automatically provide this feedback to System House.     

    If you think this is of interest, then we can set up an emeeting with you, and/or whoever you think from system house, and walk you through a demo.  

    Thanks,
    Danny
