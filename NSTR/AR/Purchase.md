      Pc wares

    - keyboard switch

    I would go for the professional edition, 
    not for the "enterprise developer" or the "enterprise architect" that have some 
    more features.
    The "standard" (i.e., slightly more than toy - no optimizer) edition is 
    probably not worth it.

    I qualify for an upgrade from the Version 6.
