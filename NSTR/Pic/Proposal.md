    Proposal:  A series of infrequent (monthly) mini-tutorials focused on  
               emerging sub-areas of Artificial Intelligence that have the 
               potential for impact at IBM. 
     
    Scope: 
    - Should be a topic appropriate for publication in the Journal for 
      Artificial Intelligence or the Machine Learning Journal. 
    - Should be applicable to the construction or evaluation of 
      practical applications. 
     
    Format: 
    - We will maintain a short list of open topics of interest in a notes database. 
    - Participants can post new suggestions, vote for existing suggestions, or 
      volunteer to give the presentation for an area using this database. 
    - The presenter will choose 2 to 6 seminal papers on the specific method,  
      approach, or school of thought. 
    - They will give a 60 to 90 minute presentation that summarizes key 
      approaches and results from the area, and will highlight ways the  
      technology might impact IBM. 
    - The presentation schedule will be augmented with outside speakers, also 
      within the area of Artificial Intelligence. 
     
     
     
    Typical presentation topics might include: 
    - Learning Hidden Markov Models 
    - Reinforcement Learning 
    - Learning baysian networks (baysian learning) 
    - Statistical Methods 
    - Time series learning methods 
    - Feature construction 
     
     
     
     
     
    QUESTIONS 
     
    - Are their appropriate channels for this? 
      How do we best advertise this? 
     
    - Invited Speakers?  Do the invited speakers also give summaries of area? 
      or the more conventional talks on their work?
