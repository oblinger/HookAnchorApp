# Habits.Balance --

     <<>>

    * The BALANCE habit is to explicitly enumerate a set of activities over some/all of work/personal life, 
      and then regularly assess and adjust actual time spent.













    <<>>
    - Attempt to attain the work balance below on each day

    * Most days I should feel "on top" of each of my primary <<>> areas:
      ADMIN     <~1.5hr  --  Reviewed each day.   Updated each day.
      PROJ      >=3.0hr  --  Reviewed each day.   Updated each week.  --> week.info
                             (some days use 1 hr for proactive proj)
      PROF       ~1.0hr  --  Reviewed each month.                     --> week.info
      SLACK/PER <=2.0hr  --  Including lunch

      HOME               -- Reviewed each month.                      --> week.info
      HACK               -- Reviewed when I don't want to work.


    * PRIORITIZATION
      AT HOME:  My personal goals are not effectively managed.
      - Takes too many hours to get personal goals done.
      - Never get to impt goals
      AT WORK:
      - Not working many hours (maybe ok)
      - not getting to proactive goals. 


      - currently working effectively at work.  (Though at a low-level)
