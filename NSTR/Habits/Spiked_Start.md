# Habits.Spiked\_Start --


    MORNING ROUTINE
     * Get out of the house fast.
     * START: * A minimal commit capsule, and 
              * A quick reaction to email <<>> calendar 
     * SPIKE BLOCK.  Begin working on my starting block.   
       Second line in 'Week' list should always be my 'top task'
     (when tired)
     * Plan rest of day
     * Read emails, do admin tasks
     * BREAK  (food?)
     * MORNING BLOCK.  After this break I am ready for my second chuck of focused work.
     * BREAK (food?) 


     * After  
       I begin my starting block.

    ###  MOTIVATION  ###
    ####################

    - In an average day, very little time gets spent on focused work.  that is just the reality.
    - Even small distractors turn into large time sinks when preparing for focused work.
    - Density of focused work is lower because of these inefficiencies in getting ready
    - Worse yet, a slow start demoralizes and increases propensity to more wasted time
    - Once working, further work is easier for a time, then I desire a break

    - THUS: want to get first block moving fast.  want to remove all distractors
    - This ensures that we get at least one extra focused block in per day.
    - The goal of spiked start is to always have a 'top prior
