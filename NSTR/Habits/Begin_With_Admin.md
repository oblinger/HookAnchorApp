    2008  15-MIN DASH

    THE COMMITMENT
    - On 8<<>>20<<>>2008 I commit to starting each "working day" with a COMMIT CAPSULE.
    - I commit to executing the admin <<>> work blocks more or less as determined at commit time.

    COMMIT CAPSULE
    - Immediately upon working, I execute a commit capsule.
    - At then end of this I will know the time I will begin/end admin and begin/end quad2 block
    - Generally try not to get diverted during these first periods.  If diverted try to 'pause'
      clock; short diversions are just absorbed into admin period.
    - If I start work with "other" stuff on my plate, generally try to push stuff to period 
      immediately after quad2, but can decide to do other stuff first, can decide any other 
      lengths of time for both blocks, 
    - Generally admin block is 30 or 90 min, and Q2 is 90 min.  But can decide anything in Capsule.
    - Generally try to have Quad2 'goals' lined up so I can work on them, but can also use Q2
      time for planning.

    THE PLAN
    - Most mornings I will start with a 90-min admin session
    - the beginning of that session will group tasks to do in my todo list
    - emails that will talk longer will end up in that list too
    - when I have much todo I may use a second 90-slot, or even more on rare occasions.
    - but once I am done, then I don't mess w. admin for the day.
    - Dont do admin tasks when not at work at desk, just not as efficient elsewhere.

    MOTIVATION
    - My days are often burdened by a non-stop feeling of details to deal with.
    - I often do not get to the important tasks of the day.
