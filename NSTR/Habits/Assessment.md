    EXECUTION
    I just dont feel I get enough done per day.  My thinking on the causes:
    - CORE.  I dont just get the core of the task done well enough and let the rest go.  I take too long on each task.
    - SLOP.  I don't decisively jump from one task to the next, and decisively attack each, I goof off inbetween them too.
    - HOURS.  I am just not putting in the number of hours needed.  cause other things get in there.
    - LONG SIDETRACKS.  I will do some other activity (e.g. GO, or lunch.)  for way too long.  need to be time constrained.
    - PRIORITY.  I am not always working on the most impt stuff.  I am doing lots of things.
    SOLUTIONS:
    - My <<>> approach attacks: core, priority, and slop (at least on the start stuff)



    THE EVIL HOUR
    - Often feel "I am not ready for XXX now, as soon as I catch up then"  but I never do, and never will.
    - I must have an approach what *assumes* that I will never catch up, and works anyway
    - I must interrupt my normal flow to ensure nothing critical gets dropped.
      (1) Every working day my *FIRST* activity must be the 5C+Mail (~15 min)
      (2) Meditation (~15 min)
      (3) Attack most evil stuff hanging over my head
    - Exceptions:
      If some task requires *immediate* attention.
      Evil hour may grow or shrink as appropriate, but should
           not shrink below 1<<>>2 hour. 
      Being "into" some project (no matter what it is) is NOT an exception.
      Wanting to browse the net is NOT an exception.
      Eating is not an exception, it can be done during meditation or 5Cs (could be a 15 min exception)
    - Assessment:
      - Did 5C happen early?
      - Did I attack important tasks?
      - Do I feel caught up?
        - Do I know what important activities need to be done and when?
        - Do I have a plan for today?
      - Have I dropped the ball on anything?
    - Remediation:
      - If I am failing, then I need to sit down I extend this plan.
