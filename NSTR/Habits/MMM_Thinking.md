    Massive, Multiprong, Method

    Ok, dieting is not working.  I think some things do work, but there are pressures
    that push me backwards with increasing intensity as I move forward. But the problem 
    is too important to give up on.  The solution is to line up as many factors as
    possible in my favor for MAINTAINING weight.  Since the goal is the maintaince of weight
    loss, then these factors themselves must be retainable for a lifetime.

    So use extra methods for loss, and then as many methods as feasible simultaneously 
    to avoid weight gain, given the increase pressure in that direction.

    Here is an exhaustive list of the methods:


    EATING LOG.
    I simply keep a log for real, starting on 9/6/2007 

    EXERCISE.    
    Got to do regular, vigorous, exercise.  Got to fit it in, in such a way that it is forever 
    maintainable, even given my desire to make every hour count.

    when?  1/2 hour after work, before eating?  Setup for reading&music&thinking


    WORK EATING: ProtDrink, Salad, YougGranola


    HOME EATING.


    TRAVEL EATING.  <<>>
    - TravelPak:   Veggies&Spices, Soup, Fruit, Salmon/Tuna & Wasa
      - VEG: Radish, Celery(Spices,Salt,Pbutter,Hummos)    FISH?
      - Cold Turkey Rules
    - NextDay:     Almonds, 



    SATISFIED, BUT NEVER FULL.


    FOOD RULES.  
    I work well on simple rules.  Abstinance is a powerful mechanism, but it clearly has problems 
    as a life long approach.  Gotta think about this.


    NO REFINED SUGARS?
    NO FREE JUNK FOOD?
    ONLY SPECIAL TREATS?
