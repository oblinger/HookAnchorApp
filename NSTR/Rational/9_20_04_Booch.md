    (2) Serge Lucio -- Rational Function Tester
        Obtain information about Ratonal Tester, and look specificially at how
        this technoloy can be coupled with the PW technology, and how the 
        scripts generated by PW might be integrated.

        discuss possible synergies with PW.
