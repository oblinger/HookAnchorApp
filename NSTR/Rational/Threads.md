# Rational.Threads --


    See attached as an example of a "red thread".  More stuff like this exists, 
    although some material is dated.  If you're interested in this, I'll look 
    through my archives and provide you with more.  These threads are sensitive 
    because they are intended to illustrate how hard it is for people to use 
    combinations of products together, so please limit distribution.  

    You should contact <<>> to discuss "green threads".  Attached is an 
    example from the Atlantic release.  Essentially, this is Julian's effort to 
    simplify selected use cases involving product integrations.

    Your PW wizards are interesting to me because of the potential to help end 
    users with complex scenarios with minimum impact on product development.
