    #1. BE PROACTIVE
            1. For a full day, listen to your language and to the language of the people around you. How often do you use and hear 
               reactive phrases such as "If only," "I can't," or "I have to"?
        2. Identify an experience you might encounter in the near future where, based on past experience, you would probably behave reactively. 
               Review the situation in the context of your Circle of Influence. How could you respons proactively? Take several moments and create 
               the experience vividly in your mind, picturing yourself responding in a proactive manner. Remind yourself of the gap between stimulus 
               and response. Make a commitment to yourself to exercise your freedom to choose.
     -  3. Select a problem from your work or personal life that is frustrating to you. Determine whether it is a direct, indirect, or no 
               control problem. Identify the first step you can take in your Circle of Influence to solve it and then take that step.
     -  4. Try the thirty-day test of proactivity. Be aware of the change in your Circle of Influence.


    #2. BEGIN WITH THE END IN MIND
            1. Take the time to record the impressions you had in the funeral visualization at the beginning of this chapter. 
               You may want to use the chart below to organize your thoughts.
                   Area of activity     Character   Contributions   Achievements
                   Family
                   Friends
                   Work
                   Church/community service etc.
        2. Take a few minutes and write down your roles as you now see them. Are you satisfied with that mirror image of your life?
        3. Set up time to completely separate yourself from daily activities and to begin work on your personal mission statement.
        4. [Find your center(s).] Are you comfortable with the implications of your analysis?
        5. Start a collection of notes, quotes, and ideas you may want to use as resource material in writing your personal mission statement.
        6. Identify a project you will be facing in the near future and apply the principle of mental creation. Write down the 
               results you desire and what steps will lead to those results.
        7. Share the principles of Habit 2 with your family or work group and suggest that together you can begin the process of 
               developing a family of group mission statement.


    #3.  PUT FIRST THINGS FIRST
            1. Identify a Quadrant II activity you know has been neglected in your life - one that, if done well, would have a significant 
               impact in your life, either personally or professionally. Write it down and commit to implement it.
        2. Try to estimate what percentage of your time you spend in each quadrant. Then log your time for three days in fifteen-minute 
               intervals. How accurate was your estimate? Are you satisfied with the way you spend your time? What do you need to change?
        3. Make a list of responsibilities you could delegate and the people you could delegate to or train to be responsible in these areas. 
               Determine what is needed to start the process of delegation or training.
        4. Organize your next week. Start by writing down your roles and goals for the week, then transfer the goals to a specific action plan. 
               At the end of the week, evaluate how well your plan translated your deep values and purposes into your daily life and the degree of 
               integrity you were able to maintain to those values and purposes.
        5. Commit yourself to start organizing on a weekly basis and set up a regular time to do it.
        6. Either convert your current planning tool into a fourth generation tool or secure such a tool.


    #4.  THINK WIN/WIN
            1. Think about an upcoming interaction wherein you will be attempting to reach an agreement or negotiate a solution. 
               Commit to maintain a balance between courage and consideration.
        2. Make a list of obstacles that keep you from applying the Win/Win paradigm more frequently. Determine what could 
               be done within your Circle of Influence to eliminate some of those obstacles.
        3. Select a specific relationship where you would like to develop a Win/Win agreement. Try to put yourself in the other 
               person's place, and write down explicitly how you think that person sees the solution. Then list, from your own perspective, 
               what results would constitute a Win for you. Approach the other person and ask if he or she would be willing to communicate 
               until you reach a point of agreement and mutually beneficial solution.
        4. Identify three key relationships in your life. Give some indication of what you feel the balance is in each of the Emotional 
               Bank Accounts. Write down some specific ways you could make deposits in each account.
        5. Deeply consider your own scripting. Is it Win/Lose? How does that scripting affect your interactions with other people? 
               Can you identify the main source of that script? Determine whether or not those scripts serve well in your current reality.
        6. Try to identify a model of Win/Win thinking who, even in hard situations, really seeks mutual benefit. Determine now to more 
               closely watch and learn from this person's example.


    #5.  SEEK FIRST TO UNDERSTAND, THEN TO BE UNDERSTOOD
            1. Select a relationship in which you sense the Emotional Bank Account is in the red. Try to understand and write down the 
               situation from the other person's point of view. In your next interaction, listen for understanding, comparing what you 
               are hearing with what you wrote down. How valid were your assumptions? Did you really understand that individual's perspective?
        2. Share the concept of empathy with someone close to you. Tell him or her you want to work on really listening to others and 
               ask for feedback in a week. How did you do? How did it make that person feel?
        3. The next time you have an opportunity to watch people communicate, cover your ears for a few minutes and just watch. What 
               emotions are being communicated that may not come across in words alone?
        4. Next time you catch yourself inappropriately using one of the autobiographical responses - probing, evaluating, advising, or 
               interpreting - try to turn the situation into a deposit by acknowledgment and apology. ("I'm sorry, I just realized I'm not 
               really trying to understand. Could we start again?")
        5. Base your next presentation on empathy. Describe the other point of view as well or better than its proponents; then seek to 
               have your point understood from their frame of reference.


    #6.  SYNERGIZE
            1. Think about a person who typically sees things differently than you do. Consider ways in which those differences might be used 
               as stepping-stones to third alternative solutions. Perhaps you could seek out his or her views on a current project or problem, 
               valuing the different views you are likely to hear.
        2. Make a lit of people who irritate you. Do they represent different views that could lead to synergy if you had greater intrinsic 
               security and valued the difference?
        3. Identify a situation in which you desire greater teamwork and synergy. What conditions would need to exist to support synergy? 
               What can you do to create those conditions?
        4. The next time you have a disagreement or confrontation with someone, attempt to understand the concerns underlying that person's 
               position. Address those concerns in a creative and mutually beneficial way.


    #7.  SHARPEN THE SAW
            1. Make a list of activities that would help you keep in good physical shape, that would fit your life-style and that you could enjoy over time.
        2. Select one of the activites and list it as a goal in your personal role area for the coming week. At the end of the week evaluate 
               your performance. If you didn't make your goal, was it because you subordinated it to a genuinely higher value? Or did you gail ti 
               act with integrity to your values?
        3. Make a similar list of renewing activities in your spiritual and mental dimensions. In your social-emotional area, list relationships 
               you would like to improve or specific circumstances in which Public victory would bring greater effectiveness. Select one item in each 
               area to list as a goal for the week. Implement and evaluate.
        4. Commit to write down specific "sharpen the saw" activities in all four dimensions every week, to do them, and to evaluate your 
               performance and results.
