    Many pragmatic things are right about us:
    - She is a happy & committed
    - We are both independant people

    - There is an academic connection
    - Everyone likes her
    - Religion



    Our main troubles
    - Ideas.        They are my life & she is not interested in them.
    - Outlook.      Ambition, energy, comfort-level, activities.
    - Specificity.  We are not uniquely matched in any significant way.
    - Physical.     She is less giving, I am less interested.
    - Closeness.    A disconnect at the deepest level.  Incomplete empathy.  Not my best friend.
    - Running.      I have been leaning away from her for some time.

    - Distance.     We cannot live together.

    - Style.        Ducks vs. Dress
