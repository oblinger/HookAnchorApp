# Life.Jaesook-lee --


    Minus: 
     
    - Something worries U, U just avoid 
     
    - Drag U to do something U want to do 
     
    - Not personable to my friends 
     
    - Don't care about your appearance 
     
    - Always over schedule yourself 
     
    - Not adventuresome  (``I can't'') 
      The first things that enter your mind are the reasons why something is 
      <<>> possible 
     
    - When things break I am the fixer, you would just 
      let them break. 
     
    - Parents. 
     
    - Our lives balance well together.  But they are independant, what 
      we consider fun is very different. 
     
    - I feel I am more easy going.  When problems arise, you win.  I let 
      you win to keep the peace.  Eg. yong-hee.  When and how long we meet. 
     
    - Giving is not 50-50.  Especially physically.  We are very physical. 
      Guilt drives you from this. 
      Desire and love draw you to this. 
      I must take care, if I focus on you physically, you will be 
      satisfied physically and emotionally.  Desire is satisfied, 
      but guilt is not.  You leave, even though little has been 
      given back. 
     
      If I want physical attention, I must scheme to get it. 
      I get us together, in an intimate setting as far from your 
      guilt as possible.  Then I must arouse desire in you, and 
      do not satisfy that desire.  In this state you will initiate 
      physical contact with me.  But why?  Becasue of your sincerest 
      wish to make me happy, or because you are very excited? 
     
    - If you sense an inadaquacy, you do not rush to rectify the 
      problem.  Indeed your guilt over the unfairness, or possibly 
      your fear that you _can't_ change, makes you 
      run from the problem.  You have often told me ``I don't know 
      why you put up with X.''  Don't tell me!  Fix it! 
       
       
      not because  
     
     
     
     
    Plus: 
     
    - We are very close. 
     
    - We are very honest. 
     
    - We have weathered difficult problems well. 
     
    - You are interesting some of your interests are interesting. 
     
    - We can talk, at an intellectual level.
