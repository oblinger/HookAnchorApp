    Big Picture:  
     - Balance time spent each week.  Ensure doing impt stuff
     - Accept, enjoy, enrich my life
     - Move forward with Elaine
       - Push all dimensions of my life with her to the limit
     - Give room for spiritual&elaine thinking.  
       decide if support is needed
     - I need to be living the life I want to live today--and each day.
       this is what will give me the clarity to make decisions
