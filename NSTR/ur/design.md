    [DESIGN SUMMARY]

    Perception Pipe
    - Working Memory (Set of active symbols)
    - Association Engine (add/deletes symbols based on tapered inference)
      - Reification
      - Rerepresentation

    Procedure Executor  (Conscious control)

















    HIGH-LEVEL PROCESSES
    * These processes correspond to conscious thinking patterns in humans.
      They are strategies used to accomplish some task.
      (An example might be the process of planning, explicit reasoning
       about consequences of a sequence of actions)
    * These processes can be learned by explain the steps to the system,
      and by working out concrete examples with the system.
    * The system builds a representation of the procedure (at the level
      it is explained) using its universal learning mechanisms.
    * The controller can then 'execute' the procedure by performing the
      specified mental actions at each step.
       


    CONTROLLER
    * Mechanism that controls attention, resources, and sub-goals of system.
    * Like other components this system learns to optomize against its objectives
    * Toplevel objectives is simply to understand the world, (be able to 
      characterize and predict the inputs provided.)
