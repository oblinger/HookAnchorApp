    CALC:       Max/25=   $660 in 2009

    SUMMARY   
    - Thrift Savings Plan
    - Gov Retirement Savings Plan  (Tax deferred until withdraw)
    - Replaces 401K.
    - I *can* get an IRA.
    - Seperate from my Gov pension
    - USE DoD civilian pay call center to update amounts
    - MATCH:    5%  (First %3 is dollar for dollar, next 2% is 50cents per dollar)
      MAX:      $16,500 (fy 2009 ~665 after)
      FORMULA:  Max/25


    2012
    - My plan:  move all but $50 to vanguard.  (One partial withdraw allowed over lifetime of account)
    - If I rejoin gov, I will zero this account so I can later do a partial withdraw on the new account
    - I can add money back in, but I can only do a complete withdraw
    - Expense ratios are great ~.2%, but comparable to Vanguard's indexed funds, and so much less flexible.

    >> Print TSP form 77, send to vanguard for completion



    2009
    = MAX/26= 16500/26=635
    = 16,500-2,384= 14,116/22= $642  (per period)   
         1,788 after 1/31/09 pay  then +596= 2,384 at 2/14/09


    <<>>

    match to 4%.  total amt <= $16,???
