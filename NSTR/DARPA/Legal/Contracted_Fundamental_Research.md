    DARPA Instruction 65 is Clearance of DARPA Information for Public Release; it is associated with any documentation resulting or derived from DARPA-funded efforts that are intended for public release.

    DARPA Instruction 65 states that "public release review is required for information relating to DARPA programs that is produced by DARPA contractors, other than contracted fundamental research." Contracted fundamental research is defined as "grants and contracts that are(a) funded by budget Category 6.1 ("Research"), whether performed by universities or industry or (b) funded by budget Category 6.2 ("Exploratory Development") and performed on-campus at a university."
