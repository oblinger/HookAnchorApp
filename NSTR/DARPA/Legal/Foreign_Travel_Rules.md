# DARPA.Legal.Foreign\_Travel\_Rules --

    BL Team:

    DARPA tracks all foreign travel associated with our programs.  I believe the goal is to ensure that funds are aimed effectively at the goals of the program.  One of the central goals of our program is the scientific advancement of the ideas of our program, so of course this includes academic exposition of those ideas (e.g. conferences).

    Thus, the presentation of BL results in top tier conferences (regardless of where they occur) is generally sufficient grounds for spending the money to attend an international event.  Below are the guidelines we are using for other IPTO programs, and I plan to use them for this program as well.

    Thanks,
    Dan




    Foreign travel using Bootstrapped Learning Program funds must be authorized by the Government prior to travel. 
     
    The following information is required with all foreign travel requests:
    *   Who will be traveling 
    *   Travel dates 
    *   Destination(s) 
    *   Approx cost 
    *   Justification for travel 
    *   For Conferences 
        *   Event title & Location 
        *   Nature and title of presentation (e.g., Paper or Poster) 
        *   (Preprints should be included, when available) 
        *   Whether presentation will be published with conference record 
        *   For conferences, justification should include assessment of strength of conference, audience reached, knowledge gained, etc. 
     
    Minimum requirements for foreign travel requests: 
    1.  Trip needs to directly contribute to objectives of the Transfer Learning program. 
    2.  Trip needs to be within current project budget for travel. 
    3.  Trip objectives can not be accomplished by other means (e.g., an equivalent trip within the US, e-mail or phone call). 
    4.  Trip location is appropriate for a US Government sponsored trip. 
     
    Justification is required for each individual requesting approval for foreign travel. It is important that all proposed travelers make clear how their individual participation on this visit will directly contribute to project objectives.
     
    Requests should be submitted through, and approved by, the primes.  BAE should submit requests to AFRL (Dale.VanCleave@WPAFB.AF.MIL) with a copy to DARPA (Pietro.Michelucci.ctr@darpa.mil). SRI should submit requests to Douglas.Pollock@darpa.mil with a copy to Pietro.Michelucci.ctr@darpa.mil.  The contracting officers will coordinate with the DARPA Program Manager and obtain his approval, disapproval, or request for additional information and notify the prime of the decision.
     
    Upon completion of approved travel the traveler is required to submit a timely trip report explaining what was accomplished and how the trip actually did contribute to the project objectives.  The trip report should also provide the actual costs.  If more than one individual from an organization traveled, a single report for the group with each person's contribution and costs clearly and specifically identified is desired. Submit the trip report to the prime contractor. The prime will then review it and forward to Dan and Dale/Doug (as appropriate) so the Government can evaluate cost vs benefit of the trip. Timely reporting is typically within a week of completion of travel; if additional time is necessary it should be requested within the week and may be granted for a period of up to two more weeks.
