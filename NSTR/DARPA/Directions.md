    Heres what I would do: 

    Assuming you are coming off 66 from the West, youll end up on North Fairfax Drive. 
    Take a left on Quincy and then your first right (100 feet in front of the library) onto 10th. 
    If you see a parking spot, grab it  many of them take two hours (and some 4). 
    If you dont find one to your liking, in about a block youll see public parking underneath 
    the SET building on your right. SET will gladly reimburse your $12 parking fee.
