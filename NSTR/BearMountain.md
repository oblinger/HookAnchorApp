    on Sunday.  So lets try again this Sunday.  I am a bit more organized
    for this one as well (actually sending out an email, etc.)
    Below are the directions to bear mountain, and where we are meeting.
    If you havent been there Bear Mountain has some really beautiful
    hiking, and it is pretty close.  Let me know if you think you can
    come, and if you can help out by driving.  (We will have enough
    cars for those who dont have them)
