    POST GENOMIC LEARNING  --  The learning people do 
    when attacking tasks that did not exist during 
    human evolution.

      - It is not exactly domain independent learning, but it
        is learning that cannot be tuned to the target task.

      - The knowledge used by this process may be quite 
        domain dependent facts about the world, but the
        PROCESS applying that to the novel target, 
        CANNOT depend on the task since it was fixed before
        the task existed.

      - It is clear that amount of background K an adult
        has is enormous.  It is also clear that the number
        of processes that adult uses to transform that K
        for new contexts is much fewer.  Is that set 
        small enough to encode?

    The human genome encodes specific structures in the brain.
    These structures encode innate knowlege and innate processes.
    (e.g. the transformation from time to frequency domains is
    innate it is known implicitly by the wiring of the ear/brain.)

    This knowlege and processes are tuned for the world they were
    evolved to serve.  But humans adapt and apply this knowlege
    and processes for use in our modern world, and world with 
    concepts and tasks evolution has not had time to make adjustments 
    for.

    Thus we use the term 'post genomic learning' to refer to 
    a particular type of domain independent learning.  It
    is learning that relys on processes that were created and
    tweaked without knowlege of the ultimate target domains 
    of applicabilty.  

    The innate knowlege that humans have about this world can be 
    arbitrarily complex and idiosyncratically specialized to the 
    nature of this world.  By comparison the post genomic 
    learning processes humnans employ *MUST* be more generalized and
    not closely tied to their target domain, since by definition
    those domains were unknown during evolution of the genome.

    These post genomic processes must be quite powerful in humans
    since they are capable of building towering edifices of knowlege
    that contain many post genomic layers that were all learned by
    mechanisms that could not have been specialized to those layers.

    They are also powerful in that they are able to construct
    appropriate representations for an unknonwn new target domain 
    starting with representations that are profoundly
    inappropriate for that target.  For example human PGL
    manages to graft a great many target domains onto some
    core spatial represtation, yet that spatial representation
    was evolved without those target representations in mind.

    Humans do not require that the innate knowlege be matched
    to the target domain in order for their PGL processes to operate.
    This suggests (but does not prove) that we can search for these
    PGLs and test them using a variety of source innate knowledge
    and target domains.  

    Because the strength of PGLs is that they work even when the 
    represenatations are not matched, we can test for them using
    representations that may not adequtely catpure human innate 
    knowlege.  The test of a PGL is its abilty to bridge, not
    in what it started with.

    If this is true, it is a great advantage, since we expect 
    human innate knowlege to be a large complex and idiocyncratic
    body of information.  A research agenda that does not require
    first encoding this body of knowledge is at a significant 
    advantage.

    That is what i want to do.


    NOTE:  It must be conceeded that it is possible that even 
    though the target domains vary widely and were not known
    to evolution, it is still possible that the source knoweldge
    must be exactly the innate human knowledge.  PGLs will only
    operate if that is their source.

    I find this implausible, since PGLs can build many layers on 
    top of prior PGL learned info (that could not be specialized
    into the genome)  So the ith layering done by a PGL did
    not start with a known source.  Why should it be important
    that the 0th level was all innate knowledge?
    But i must conceede that I cannot prove that this is non-requirement.




    A very rambling note.  sorry about that, but this concept is still quite slippery in my mind.




    indeed with inital representations that 
    created without any consideration of the target domain.

    post genomic learning.

    - learning processes (and their outputs) which could not based on
      processes that could not be a-priori specialized to the learning
      task.

    Note:  PGL can be based on both K and processes that are pre-GL,
           but that pre-GL stuff cannot be specialized
