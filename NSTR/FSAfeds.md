    If you are participating in the PR program for 2008, there are a few things to keep in mind. 

    - Do NOT submit a manual claim for medical services that will be processed through PR. Doing so will result in a denial of the paper claim and increased administrative expenses for the program. 

    - If you did not enroll in PR during Open Season, you may enroll any time by logging in to My Account Summary (www.fsafeds.com/fsafeds/login/participantlogin.asp), if your FEHB plan participates.  Please note that not all FEHB plans participate in PR.  To find out if your plan participates, visit (www.fsafeds.com/forms/paperlessreimb.pdf).
