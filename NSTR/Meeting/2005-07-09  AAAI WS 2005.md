    =====  INTERACTION BETWEEN INPUTS
    Dan Roth.  "incorprorate learning and constaints into parsing process and Q/A process"   
               IJCAI 2005 paper on semantic labelling.  easier to read:  CONLL 2004 author yih
    - inference w classifiers
      learn many classifiers incorporate constraints

    Chris Manning.  entailment  inference together learning

    @look at Dan roth (most recent talk.... entailment)

    NLP entailment

    int NLP lots use Predicate Arugment representation:   
      Martha Palmer  ".... Prop bank ...."

    ====
    Program:  text for a cake --> script

    THE ROLES
    -  Ladder builders
    -  Base component builder
    -  Learning/Reasoning component builder
    -  SRI integrator
       - Redundant Performers

    - Separate funding for "spice" for the 

    - 5-guys of email parsing.  
      - low and high goals.

    - CELO as a task
    - 


    !!!  given the learning component in a shared universal facile rep. 


    -- the thought experiment, if CALO provided who would use.   if BSL were provided who whould use.


    - one page abstracts, from everyone and pedro&tom vetted them.

    QUESTIONS:
    - Pazzani   How do we get CogSci methodologies accepted at AAAI, ICML, and NIPS

    - Constrained to specific comprehensible models.  
      Langley's generic process models.  Pazzani's constrained regression.

    ** general algorithms, for multiple models?!  (generate & test)
    ** Looking thru many model structures


    POINTS:


    IDEAS: 
    - Prototype models


    <<>>
    Its not about comprehensibility rather it is about Acceptability
    <<>>
    TWO APPROACHES
    (1)  Learn comprehensible models.
    (2)  Explain accurate model using second simpler model for explanation.
          (Case Based Explanation)

    <<>>
    GOOD SURROGATES FOR COMPREHENSIBILITY
    * Simplified user model
    * Output delta from K given by user

    OTHER METHODOLOGIES
    * User studies (ask people)
      Credabilty measures
      measure performance of human-computer team
    * Real deployed applications


    <<>>
    Expanations of individual prediction vs.
    Explanation of entire model
