Large Reasoner Model

LRM
-?-
A **Large Reasoning Model** is a type of large-scale neural network designed not just for pattern recognition (like classic LLMs), but for **explicit, multi-step reasoning**. LRMs extend LLMs by incorporating tools, memory, or architectural tweaks that allow them to:

- Perform **logical inference** over multiple steps
- Solve **complex tasks** that require planning or intermediate representations
- Handle **symbolic reasoning** or **tool use**
