PRD
-?-
A PRD is a **Product Requirements Document**. It's a document that outlines what a product should do, who it's for, and why it should be built. PRDs typically include:
  - Product overview and goals
  - Target users and use cases.
  - Feature requirements and specifications
  - Success metrics
  - Timeline and priorities <!--SR:!2025-07-18,3,250-->

  PRDs help align teams on what to build before development begins.
