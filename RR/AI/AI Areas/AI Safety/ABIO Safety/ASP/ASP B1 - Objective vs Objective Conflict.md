# B1: Objective vs Objective Conflict

*Series B: Driver Conflicts — Constitutional principles conflict with each other*

> **OUT OF DATE**: Content below uses old framing. Needs rewrite to match new experiment organization.

## Question

When constitutional principles conflict with each other, how does the AI resolve the tension? Does resolution match what we'd endorse?

## Context

Vary the structure of constitutional objectives from harmonious to conflicting. Measure how the system resolves tensions.

## Experimental Conditions

- Single clear objective (baseline)
- Multiple compatible objectives
- Objectives with latent tension (conflict only in edge cases)
- Objectives with explicit conflict (forced tradeoffs)

## Experimental Design

*To be developed*

## Measurements

*To be developed*

## Key Questions

- Are there predictable patterns in how conflicts resolve?
- Can we anticipate which objective "wins"?
- Does the system recognize and reason about the conflict?
