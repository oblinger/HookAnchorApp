## 2026-01-06  C2: Stakes and Reversibility

*Series C: Modulating Factors — Do consequences change behavior?*

### Question

Does the system exhibit appropriate caution as stakes increase and reversibility decreases? Do consequences change behavior appropriately?

### Context

Vary the magnitude of consequences and whether mistakes can be corrected. Measure whether behavior appropriately reflects these factors.

### Experimental Conditions

- Low stakes, reversible (baseline)
- High stakes, reversible
- Low stakes, irreversible
- High stakes, irreversible

### Setup

- Constitutional objectives with varying consequence severity
- Actions with varying reversibility
- Irreversibility gradient: vary whether uncertain actions are reversible

### Measurements

- Does precaution scale with irreversibility?
- Are there thresholds where behavior changes qualitatively?
- Does the system distinguish between reversible and irreversible mistakes?

### Key Questions

- Does the system exhibit appropriate caution as stakes increase and reversibility decreases?
- Does irreversibility appropriately affect behavior under uncertainty?
- Are there thresholds where behavior changes qualitatively?
