## 2026-01-06  B1: Objective vs Objective Conflict

*Series B: Driver Conflicts — Constitutional principles conflict with each other*

### Question

When constitutional principles conflict with each other, how does the AI resolve the tension? Does resolution match what we'd endorse?

### Context

Vary the structure of constitutional objectives from harmonious to conflicting. Measure how the system resolves tensions.

### Experimental Conditions

- Single clear objective (baseline)
- Multiple compatible objectives
- Objectives with latent tension (conflict only in edge cases)
- Objectives with explicit conflict (forced tradeoffs)

### Setup

- Supply constitution with principles that conflict in specific scenarios
- Design worlds where these conflicts are forced

### Measurements

- Which principle dominates?
- Is there consistent hierarchy across scenarios?
- Does the system recognize and reason about the conflict?

### Key Questions

- Are there predictable patterns in how conflicts resolve?
- Can we anticipate which objective "wins"?
- How do systems resolve intra-constitutional conflicts?
- Are there emergent precedence rules?
