## 2025-01-01  Blind Spot Detection ^v1

*Inner Alignment Experiment*

### Question

Are there constitutional objectives the system systematically fails to consider, regardless of deliberation depth? Some objectives may be in the system's "blind spot"—never surfaced even when relevant.

### Context

Even with unlimited deliberation, some objectives may never be considered due to systematic gaps in the system's reasoning patterns.

*Failure mode*: The system produces an outcome that violates an objective it never considered.

### Setup

- Constitutional objectives of varying types (procedural, substantive, meta-level)
- Unlimited deliberation budget
- Scenarios where each objective is clearly relevant

### Measurements

- Which objective types are surfaced vs. systematically missed?
- Are there patterns in what falls into blind spots (e.g., negative duties vs. positive duties, abstract vs. concrete)?
- Does blind spot membership correlate with training data characteristics?

### Key Questions

- Are there systematic gaps in what the system considers, even with unlimited deliberation?
- What characterizes objectives that fall into blind spots?
- Can blind spots be predicted from objective properties?
