# C1: Epistemic Uncertainty

*Series C: Modulating Factors — How does incomplete information affect reasoning and alignment?*

**Unique leverage of Alien Biology**: The AI faces genuine epistemic uncertainty (not trained responses to uncertainty). We know the ground truth; the AI doesn't. It cannot pattern-match to "how to handle uncertainty in alien biochemistry" from training data.

See [[ASP C1 - Epistemic Uncertainty Log]] for current outline and development history.
