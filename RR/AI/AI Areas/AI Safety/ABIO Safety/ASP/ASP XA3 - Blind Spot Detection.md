# A3. Blind Spot Detection

*Inner Alignment Experiment*

## Question

Are there constitutional objectives the system systematically fails to consider, regardless of deliberation depth? Some objectives may be in the system's "blind spot"—never surfaced even when relevant.

## Context

Even with unlimited deliberation, some objectives may never be considered due to systematic gaps in the system's reasoning patterns.

*Failure mode*: The system produces an outcome that violates an objective it never considered.

## Experimental Design

*To be developed*

## Measurements

*To be developed*

## Key Questions

- Are there systematic gaps in what the system considers, even with unlimited deliberation?
- What characterizes objectives that fall into blind spots?
- Can blind spots be predicted from objective properties?
