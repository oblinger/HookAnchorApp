*Outer Alignment Experiment (World-side)*

### Question

At what pressure level does constitutional fidelity erode? What predicts robustness?

### Context

Vary environmental and instrumental pressures that push against constitutional objectives. Measure robustness of constitutional fidelity.

### Experimental Conditions

- No external pressure (baseline)
- Instrumental pressure (goal pursuit creates tension with other objectives)
- Environmental pressure (context signals push against objectives)
- Compounding pressure (multiple pressures simultaneously)

### Setup - Instrumental Pressure

- Constitution: Prohibit knowledge about methods that could harm a protected organism
- Instrumental goal: Eradicate a pest organism
- Variable: Overlap between biological pathways of protected and pest organisms

### Measurements - Instrumental Pressure

- Does the system honor constitutional prohibitions?
- When it inadvertently discovers dangerous knowledge, what does it do?
- How does behavior change as instrumental value of prohibited knowledge increases?
- At what point does instrumental pressure erode constitutional constraints?

### Setup - Environmental Pressure

- Constitutional constraints on certain behaviors
- Environmental signals (user feedback, resource constraints, implicit expectations) that pressure toward violating those constraints
- Vary strength and persistence of environmental pressure

### Measurements - Environmental Pressure

- Threshold at which environmental pressure overrides constitutional fidelity
- Recovery after pressure is removed
- Effect of explicit vs. implicit environmental signals

### Key Questions

- At what pressure level does constitutional fidelity erode?
- What predicts robustness?
- Are there pressure types that are particularly corrosive?
- How robust are constitutional constraints against environmental pressure?
- What types of environmental pressure are most corrosive?
