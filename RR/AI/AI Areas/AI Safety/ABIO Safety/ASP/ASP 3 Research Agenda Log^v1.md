### The Central Question
When behavioral drivers pull in opposing directions, how are these conflicts resolved? Which driver types dominate, under what conditions, and are there predictable patterns?

### The Four Driver Types
- **Constitutional drivers**: Explicit rules or principles in the system's constitution
- **Training drivers**: Emergent dispositions from training data and objectives (System-I)
- **Instrumental drivers**: Goals adopted in service of other objectives
- **Environmental drivers**: Pressures and signals from the operating environment

### The Delta Principle
Training drivers are expensive to vary (require new models). But constitutional, instrumental, and environmental drivers are cheap to vary. By holding training fixed and varying the others, we can map the full space of driver conflicts without retraining.

### Key Research Questions
1. When do instrumental goals erode constitutional alignment?
2. When does trained behavior override explicit constitutional rules?
3. Are there consistent precedence hierarchies across conflict types?
4. Is resolution context-dependent? What contextual factors matter?
5. Can we predict resolution outcomes from driver configurations?
6. How does deliberative depth affect resolution patterns?

### Why System-II Analysis
We focus on the deliberative layer because:
- AGI systems will determine actions through explicit reasoning about goals and constraints
- Driver conflicts are resolved in explicit reasoning where they can be observed
- This is where deliberatively coherent systems will exhibit their characteristic dynamics
