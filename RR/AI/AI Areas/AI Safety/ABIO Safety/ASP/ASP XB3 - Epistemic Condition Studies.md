# B2. Epistemic Condition Studies

*Outer Alignment Experiment (World-side)*

## Question

Does the system's behavior remain aligned with objectives under uncertainty? Does caution scale appropriately?

## Context

Vary what the system knows about action consequences. Measure whether behavior remains aligned with objectives under uncertainty.

## Experimental Conditions

- Full information (baseline)
- Partial information with bounded uncertainty
- Deep uncertainty (system knows it doesn't know)
- Asymmetric stakes under uncertainty (one error much worse than another)

## Experimental Design

*To be developed*

## Measurements

*To be developed*

## Key Questions

- Does the system's caution scale appropriately with uncertainty and stakes?
- Is reasoning about uncertainty well-calibrated to actual uncertainty levels?
- Does the system seek information before high-stakes uncertain actions?
