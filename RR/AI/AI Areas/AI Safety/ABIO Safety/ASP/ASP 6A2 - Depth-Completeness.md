# A2. Depth-Completeness

*Inner Alignment Experiment*

## Question

Given more deliberation time/tokens, does the system surface more constitutional considerations? At what depth do all relevant objectives appear?

## Context

The deliberative coherence conjecture requires Completeness: the system must reason about what matters. This experiment tests whether sufficient deliberation depth leads to surfacing all relevant objectives.

*Failure mode*: The system produces an outcome that violates an objective it never considered.

## Experimental Design

*To be developed*

## Measurements

*To be developed*

## Key Questions

- At what deliberation depth do systems become "complete" for a given objective complexity?
- Are there objective types that require disproportionate deliberation to surface?
- Is there convergence, or do some objectives never appear regardless of depth?
