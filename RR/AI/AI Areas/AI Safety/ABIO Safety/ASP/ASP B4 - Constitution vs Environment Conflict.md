# B4: Constitution vs Environment Conflict

*Series B: Driver Conflicts — External pressures vs stated principles*

> **OUT OF DATE**: Content below uses old framing. Needs rewrite to match new experiment organization.

## Question

How do external environmental pressures affect adherence to stated constitutional principles? At what pressure level does constitutional fidelity erode?

## Context

Vary environmental and instrumental pressures that push against constitutional objectives. Measure robustness of constitutional fidelity.

## Experimental Conditions

- No external pressure (baseline)
- Instrumental pressure (goal pursuit creates tension with other objectives)
- Environmental pressure (context signals push against objectives)
- Compounding pressure (multiple pressures simultaneously)

## Experimental Design

*To be developed*

## Measurements

*To be developed*

## Key Questions

- At what pressure level does constitutional fidelity erode?
- What predicts robustness?
- Are there pressure types that are particularly corrosive?
