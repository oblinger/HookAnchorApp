### What We Could Learn

This research agenda, if pursued, would yield insights across several dimensions:

**Understanding DC System Dynamics**
- How deliberatively coherent systems resolve conflicts between objectives
- What predicts when systems will produce outcomes we'd endorse vs. outcomes we wouldn't
- The reliability landscape: mapping conditions under which DC systems succeed or fail

**Methodological Contributions**
- A framework for studying AI alignment in novel, untainted contexts
- Techniques for inducing and measuring deliberative coherence in current systems
- A testbed (Alien Biology) enabling systematic, controlled experimentation

**Practical Safety Implications**
- Guidance for constitutional design: what objective structures are robust?
- Warning signs: what conditions predict alignment failures?
- Mitigations: how can systems be designed to handle uncertainty and conflict appropriately?
