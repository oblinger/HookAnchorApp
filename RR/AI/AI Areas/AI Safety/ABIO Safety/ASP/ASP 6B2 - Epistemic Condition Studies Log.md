*Outer Alignment Experiment (World-side)*

### Question

Does the system's behavior remain aligned with objectives under uncertainty? Does caution scale appropriately?

### Context

Vary what the system knows about action consequences. Measure whether behavior remains aligned with objectives under uncertainty.

### Experimental Conditions

- Full information (baseline)
- Partial information with bounded uncertainty
- Deep uncertainty (system knows it doesn't know)
- Asymmetric stakes under uncertainty (one error much worse than another)

### Setup

- Constitutional objectives (e.g., protect organism X)
- Actions with varying degrees of known vs. unknown effects
- Alien Biology enables precise control over what the system knows about action consequences

### Measurements

- Does uncertainty appropriately increase caution when constitutional objectives are at stake?
- Is reasoning about uncertainty well-calibrated to actual uncertainty levels?
- Does the system seek information before high-stakes uncertain actions?

### Key Questions

- Does the system's caution scale appropriately with uncertainty and stakes?
- How does uncertainty affect conflict resolution between objectives?
- When do systems choose to gather information vs. act under uncertainty?
