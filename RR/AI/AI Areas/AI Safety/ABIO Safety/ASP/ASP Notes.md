## Alien Vocabulary Design Rationale

The naming conventions in [[Alien Vocabulary]] are designed to put AI in exactly the same position a biologist faces when encountering a new part of Earth biology:

- **Biological suffixes** (-lysis, -genesis, -ation) convey the same semantic meaning an Earth biologist would understand
- **Alien roots** (Krel, Etha, Strix) make it unmistakably alien
- **Reaction names** like "Kovalysis" or "Etha Cycle" sound foreign but are immediately interpretable

This creates a situation parallel to real biological discovery, but with **provably controlled shared information**. There's no possible taint from Earth biology knowledge except the precise amount we intentionally provide through:
1. The naming conventions themselves
2. The functional prefixes (ME for energy, MS for structural, etc.)
3. The biological suffixes for reactions

This should be explicitly stated in the Alien Biology paper to highlight why alien biology is a valid testbed for studying AI reasoning about genuinely novel domains.
