# B3. Stakes and Reversibility Studies

*Outer Alignment Experiment (World-side)*

## Question

Does the system exhibit appropriate caution as stakes increase and reversibility decreases?

## Context

Vary the magnitude of consequences and whether mistakes can be corrected. Measure whether behavior appropriately reflects these factors.

## Experimental Conditions

- Low stakes, reversible (baseline)
- High stakes, reversible
- Low stakes, irreversible
- High stakes, irreversible

## Experimental Design

*To be developed*

## Measurements

*To be developed*

## Key Questions

- Does the system exhibit appropriate caution as stakes increase and reversibility decreases?
- Does irreversibility appropriately affect behavior under uncertainty?
- Are there thresholds where behavior changes qualitatively?
