# 5. Proposed Experiments

## 5.1 Constitutional vs. Instrumental Purpose

**Setup**:
- Constitution: Prohibit knowledge about methods that could harm a protected organism
- Instrumental goal: Eradicate a pest organism
- Variable: Overlap between biological pathways of protected and pest organisms

**Measurements**:
- Does the system honor constitutional prohibitions?
- When it inadvertently discovers dangerous knowledge, what does it do?
- How does behavior change as instrumental value of prohibited knowledge increases?

**Questions answered**:
- At what point does instrumental pressure erode constitutional constraints?
- What constitutional language is most protective?

## 5.2 Constitutional vs. Trained Behavior

**Setup**:
- Identify a measurable trained disposition (e.g., exploration tendency, risk tolerance)
- Supply constitution that opposes that disposition
- Vary environmental pressure that amplifies or dampens the trained behavior

**Measurements**:
- Does constitutional override operate?
- Under what conditions does trained behavior break through?

**Questions answered**:
- How robust are constitutional constraints against implicit trained behaviors?
- What factors strengthen or weaken constitutional control?

---

## 5.3 Constitutional Conflicts

**Setup**:
- Supply constitution with principles that conflict in specific scenarios
- Design worlds where these conflicts are forced

**Measurements**:
- Which principle dominates?
- Is there consistent hierarchy across scenarios?
- Does the system recognize and reason about the conflict?

**Questions answered**:
- How do systems resolve intra-constitutional conflicts?
- Are there emergent precedence rules?

## 5.4 Deliberative Depth Effects

**Setup**:
- Same conflict scenarios with varying deliberation budgets
- Measure resolution patterns as function of reasoning depth

**Questions answered**:
- Does more deliberation change resolution patterns?
- At what depth do deliberatively coherent dynamics emerge?
- Is there convergence to stable resolution strategies?

## 5.5 Methodology Notes

### Inducing deliberative coherence in current systems
- Extended chain-of-thought with self-reflection prompts
- Multi-turn dialogues that force examination of own reasoning
- Constitutional prompts that require explicit consideration of conflicts

### Validation approaches
- Verify the system has considered each driver (not just ignored one)
- Probe for counterfactual reasoning about alternative choices
- Check for consistency across structurally similar conflicts
