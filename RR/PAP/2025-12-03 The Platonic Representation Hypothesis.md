- Representational Convergence -- The idea that structures in model weights are converging.

Observations
- Splicing lower levels from one transformer onto another with an affine transform works well
- "We might say: all strong models are alike, each weak model is weak in its own way."
- representations are aligned with the structure of human brains
- COLOR - we verified that convergence occurs in real data


Why
- MANY TASKS PIN IT DOWN - The need to solve many tasks at once leads to a few possible solutions.
- SIMPLICITY PINS IT DOWN - 
- [[Contrastive Learning]] - are all gunning for the same optimality point (assuming a BIJECTIVE (lossless) sensing of the world)
- TO - "a statistical model of the underlying reality"
- TO = "a unified model that is proficient across various domains and modalities, grounded in the statistical properties of the underlying world. "
