  What SAM Does

  SAM takes an image and identifies the boundaries of objects/regions, creating masks (pixel-level outlines) for anything you want to segment. Unlike
  traditional segmentation models that only recognize specific trained categories (like "person", "car"), SAM is a foundation model that can segment any
  visual object or region, even things it's never seen before.
