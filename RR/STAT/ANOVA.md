 ANOVA
-?-
Analysis of Variance - (a multi-class t-test) - a statistical test that compares the means of three or more groups to determine if at least one group mean is statistically different from the others.
.
Key Points:
  - Used when comparing 3+ groups (for 2 groups, use t-test)
  - Tests if group means are equal
  - Tells you IF differences exist, not WHERE they are
  - Common types: One-way, Two-way, Repeated measures

  Example:

  Testing if students' test scores differ across three teaching methods:
  - Method A: Traditional
  - Method B: Online
  - Method C: Hybrid

  ANOVA would tell you if there's a significant difference between any of these methods.
