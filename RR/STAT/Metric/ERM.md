ERM
-?-
  ERM = Empirical Risk Minimization
  - Goal: Minimize the average loss (error) on the training data
  - Formula: Find parameters that minimize: (1/n) Σ L(f(xᵢ), yᵢ)
  - L = loss function
  - f(xᵢ) = model prediction
  - yᵢ = actual label
  In simple terms: Choose the model that makes the fewest mistakes on your training data.
