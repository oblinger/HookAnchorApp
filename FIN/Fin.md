## DEFERRED COMP
#### 2019-06-13 -- Can go to 0-300K each year
Hi Dan,
 
Here’s what the Actuary said,
 
“This estimate assumed a $0 2019 Schedule C, a 5% return on investment and an amendment to the benefit formula effective for the 2019 plan year. The range in the DB plan is estimated to be from $0 up to $315,969. The contribution for the assets to equal the benefits on a plan termination basis is estimated to be $92,317.
 
Note that the actual maximum deductible contribution cannot be greater than the Schedule C less 1/2 SETD so if the Schedule C is actually $0 for 2019 the maximum deductible contribution for 2019 will be $0.”
 
Like I said there isn’t any punishment or downside to doing $0.00 into the plan, if you do $0.00 for enough years, (I’ll have to get an exact number but I would be 0 contributions for 3+ years) you might have a min deposit to make.
 
This formula just gives you the flex to do $0.00 if you have no income or if you get some income you still have some range to put money away and utilize the plan if need be.
 
Like I said we can add this to the doc re-statement so 2 birds with 1 stone.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thank you,

Hi Dan,
 
I talked to our other Actuary,
 
For the Formula, once we changed it we are stuck with it for 3 years.
Once the plan is shut down and we want to re-open another one – no clock on waiting just need to make sure your benefits accrued in this plan are accounted for.
 
Once your Actuary is back well work on the redesign to get you a lower rate so you have a range of $0.00-X dollars for the next three years.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thank you,

Josh,
 
 
(1) My tax accountant says I need to file a form 5500 before July-1 since my deferred comp plan.
     Have you filed this on my behalf?  Are you going to?  Let me know if I need to do anything.
 
 
(2) I think we need to update my plan before I work 1000 hours this year.
      My plan is to closeout the plan this year so I am not paying beyond this point.
 
Let me know what we need to do.

Josh, 

As you may recall my 1099 income stopped as of July this year, and I have no specific expectation of when the next job like that will occur.  This might mean, now is the right time to make a change to my plan.  In 2019 I expect I will make $150K and my wife will make $300K.  This will probably be a lower year than later years, so I am not sure what implication that has for the fund.

I think my aim in this year is to maximize my deferred income.

What should be my plan going forward?
(Answering this probably requires a phone call)

~-~~

Also I have some questions about the year end Data Collect:

BUSINESSES — Other Businesses Owned.   
   I am currently not listing my other C-corp (New Dawn Analytics), it has nothing to do with this deferral, but I am happy to list it, if I should be.

PLAN — Within 3 years of terminating.
   Am I given what I told you above?

EMPLOYEES — Info for me
Hours:   I was full time until July.  What do I put?


Thanks,
Dan

#### SUMMARY

Process for entering / (exiting) countries

   1. country's CAPE is at a good level  (low 10-ish or ideally <7 relative to historical avg)
   2. country's current GDP seems sustainable.  (e.g. less suspicion of structural change.   Russia wars, Greek default)
   3. country's EPI measures are ok.
   4. country's current index is > than its 10 month simple moving average
   5. country's government 10yr - 3mo bond yield spread is positive

#### SLOW MEASURES
#### [CAPE]   Select countries w. CAPE below 10-ish  (ideally below 7)
#### [GDP]    Exclude based on annualized GDP
-- Look at annualize GDP that CAPE was based upon.  
   Consider if country situation is somehow non-cyclically different?
     e.g. is greece now structurally different?
#### [EPI]    Exclude based on EPI measures of country health
#### FASTER MEASURES
#### [DELTA]  Exclude countries w/o positive momentum

When all three go bad, get out.  Or more conservatively, when 2 of the 3 go bad, get out.
## Tax Consequences
### Tax Deferred Accounts

Plan for 2015
- move $$ into Roth.
- invest into tradional IRA.  plus SEP.


General Info
- IRA -- 5.5-6.5K per year (tax deferred) reduces as you earn income
- SEP -- 20% of 1099income.  25% of W2 income (of my company).  upto ~30-ish K
- Individual 401K. -- can invest more, but requires annual paperwork
### Misc info
- Defer taxes anytime you can -- unless rates to way up
- Shift to Roth if present taxes are LOWER
- Defer or not:  http://www.fpanet.org/journal/TaxDeferral/
- Roth backdoor  http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/02/08/how-a-high-earning-couple-got-roth-iras-and-you-can-too/

### notes back to Chuck

FED PROB OF RECESSION CHART
It is interesting, if you exited the US market when the Fed's model of recession rose above 20%, and re-entered the market when it dropped below 10%
you would have avoided nearly all recessions (of course this model is build over the same data it is being tested on,
but the model has very few parameters, so this is a bit less of a sin)

It would have been annoying to spand nearly 4 years out of the market starting around 1965 w/o any recession happening!
Even in 2009 it would have put me out of the market for 2 years of the run up before the crash

Still if I come up w. reasonable alternatives for placing my money, I wont be so frusturated to be out of this market.



VANGUARDS ANALYSIS OF "yardsticks"

I agree with you that Vanguard is strongly arguing for some form of P/E ratio measure as most preditive.
If I am understanding them, however, it seems that their 'FED MODEL' is not the same mode that you wrere showing me earlier in your
text.  It seems they did not consider that 'fed model'  

too bad, as it seems so predictive in the fed analysis.


ANALYSIS OF TODAY'S CAPE

http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/PE-Ratios-and-Market-Valuation.php

Their analysis of our percentile rank on CAPE values over time is really quite alarming.
so very different than the Fed Chart.



So it is interesting that looking at the Feb Probababilty of recession we are quite far from it,
yet looking at our percentile rank on the CAPE we are perilously high.  (just eyeballing the data it doesn't quite seem like we are currently 
in the 90th percentile, but that is a bit hard to eyeball.)

Anyway, I continue to be alarmed.  My plan is to be legging into Alibaba, just because I like the long term positioning of that company.
Still that does not really do anything for my current portfolio in the large.  I think CAPE is still probably the best place to start.

I am wondering what you think of Meb's "idea farm"  its only $300/yr so not a big decision.  I am inclind to do it for a year, just 
to get the perspective.  any thoughts or experience with it?

Finally I tried to re-write your conditions just to make sure I was getting your intent correctly:


-- Chuck's measure -- One way to put it all together for getting into a contry's markets:     (getting out of a countries markets)
   1. country CAPE is at a good level  (low relative to historical avg)                       (bad -- or high relative to history)
   2. country's current index is > than its 10 month simple moving average                    (or <) 
   3. country's government 10yr - 3mo bond yield spread is positive                           (or negative for getting out)


the terms in parentheses are really the important ones, correct?
since these are the measures one would track in order to pull the plug.

on the way in, I was imagining using CAPE plus things like the EPI components and well as other qualitivative considerations in choosing
spots to jump into.  is that they way you see it?  or would you imagine having a mechanical decision criteria for he way in as well?


COUNTRY INDEX
- Did you have a specfic OECD dataset that you use in computing "county index"
  at this point I would probably start by shifting into country specfic indexed funds, so a broad index would be best for me
  but I am happy to see any indicies / data sets you have been playing with....


fun stuff.  too bad I am not retired, with all the time to really quant the hell out of this stuff!

Individual - 401K ---   ((Qualified plan:  reporting needed))
- Paperwork
  - Need EIN from IRS
  - After 4250K --- file 5500 form every year after $250K -- termination has process
- total limit of 52K per year under 50years
  -- employer contribution.   18-20% of adjusted gross income
  -- salary deferal.          17.5K   (can also be Roth)
     >>> can I take this before 59.5????

Opened Roth in 

Paperwork
- EIN -- needed for I401K but not SEP or 
Simple does not give a much tax deferment

-----
i401K    
 + can contribute more at my age 18K more
 + some can go in as a Roth.
 - locked into an pre-tax
   next year:  
   ===>  first 24K directly in.  then 18% after till   max is 6K higher.
 --- cannot do loans   (but other companies can)
 --- must go into VANG investor shares only

(1) 2014 into SEP.  in 2015 you cannot
(2) in oct. get paper work for i401K



SEP IRA
- total limit this year ~52K    <52K    <20% of salary   (33.8 for Jotter in 2014)
  -- employer contribution.

--- need to have a 1099-schedule C for SEP IRA  (about ~18% or so or something like 30K)

### Tax Differed 
### ROTH

--- Mike Newheart ---
- Before 59.5 (and after 5 years) I can only pull out monies directly placed
  into the ROTH no accrued monies can be withdrawn (w/o penalty)
- After 59.5  everything

- Can contribute $5,500 Roth in 2013

- Comingling -- if I ever made an after-tax contribution to a traditional IRA
  it would taint ALL of my IRAs

- Comingling does not have any effect on a Roth (ever)

### Ideas

S-corp -- limitation:  profits need to be split.   

LLC -- must pay self employment tax (15%) on profits.







AN ANNUITY
-- Many types of so-called permanent life insurance—including whole life, universal life, and variable universal 
life insurance—combine a death benefit with an investment vehicle. 


moved $$$ C-corp to LLC  (deemed distribution)   qualified dividend 20%+3.8%


-- Can we move money to annuity and then deduct the purchase price.

-- assuming:   schedule C buisness (as long as I have started; )    hobby loss after 5.

-- charity 30-50% of income.

(0) 
(1) 83b inverse vesting.  (4hrs) 
(2) def of property to bitcoin.  (2-3hrs)
(3) active / passive   long shot bets.  generating losses.  ???
(4) deferred comp.  annuity (2-3hrs)
(5) buying re-estate (...)
(6) foundation --  xxxxx 
(7) selling IP 


GET 83b SHARES NOW
-- have inverse vesting schedule -- larger the price the *smaller* the options.
-- can we control the sale price flexibly later?
-- how long to I need to hold share, to get cap gains


--- NOPE
OPTIONS WITH A STRIKE PRICE DELTA
-- Can my employer sell me options now that vest in several years, and whose strike price will be set
   AT THAT FUTURE TIME based on the prices of the stock at that future time?
-- This would allow me to know I have money coming, but have it treated as cap gains.


ROLLING SHARES
-- Can my company sell me shares now that will vest at a variable rate depending upon the current valuation of the privately held company.
-- Each month a variable number of shares would vest.
-- After a period of time I could begin a rolling sale of these shares (whose cost basis is very low since I got all at the start)
-- These would be taxed as cap gains.
-- How long would I need to hold the shares, and could the sale be ROLLING and still retain cap gains status?


TAX DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS
--  The challege here is that the company has future unknown beyond a couple of years


TRADING SCHEME #1
-- I have a volitility leveraging automatic tranding strategy for Bitcoin
-- It requires me to own many bitcoins.  If I purchase those coins for this purpose,
   -- do I need to pay taxes on them at the time of purchase?
   -- can redeptions later be counted as cap gains (after cost basis)?

TRADING SCHEME #2
-- Can I use proceeds to fund call/puts as insurance on "long odds bets"
   -- These will be losses that occur now, since each time I must pay this insurance.
   -- Occasionally my "long odds bet" will pay off.  This one trade will have a low cost basis, but a high present value.
   -- Later I can sell the proceeds from this long odds bet with most treated as cap gains. 


HACKER HOUSES 
-- Create partnership with Nick a co-founder in another business.  
-- Buy properties and use those properties to house our Devs in different countries.
-- Contribute excess income from our C-corp into this wholly owned partnership.
-- When it comes time to sell can the fact that this property was used as part of a hacker house buisness allow us to treat this

from prenup guy?
Hi, Dan. Your perspective that your separate property should pay its own taxes seems quite reasonable and appropriate. It would not be hard to figure out the ratio of separate property income to community property income and then pay that percentage from other separate property. Rather than sending the taxing authorities two checks, the simplest thing may be to reimburse the community for the expense from your separate property and document the ratio calculation and actual reimbursement.

## 2015-07-11 -- Tax consequences


but consider, after 10 years at 8% your money has almost exactly doubled in value.  so in the pre-tax case this would be   $100 # 2 then taxed at .15 = $200 # (1 - .15) = $170 
In the post tax case we take $100 and tax at .15 to get $85.  



200%   10 year @ 7.18% annual increase
25%   tax rate
15%   cap gains tax


PRETAX INVESTMENT     $100 # 2 # .75  =  $150
POST TAX INVESTMENT   $100 * .75 * 2  =  $150
  CAP GAINS           $150 - $100 * . 15 = $50 * .15 = 7.50

TAX CONSEQUENCES

-- Quote from Ben:
   Your corporation tax is 100% deductable and your personal income tax is only base on 
   60-65% of the Premium that your corporation contributed on your behalf

-- DAN's DERIVATIONS
   -- For every $1 in AFTER TAX corp money you put into an IUL investments you could have put 
      $0.52 dollars into an after tax investment
 
    T = taxes on IUL = .45(MarginalTaxRate) * .62(participation rate) * investment
    orig = T + investment
    orig = 1.30 * investment

    money that would have been available for investing if I did NOT invest in an IUL ==
      == orig * .89(payrolltax) * .45(TaxRate) == orig * .40 == or == .52 * investment

>>> So for every dollar that I put into an IUL I could have put 52 cents into an after tax investment INSTEAD.  So
    -- after 5 years of annual compounding this would have increased by 23% (assuming 7% average in the market) So
    Account Balance = 64% * invest 


>>> For each dollar invested directly into an IUL I have
    Account Balance = 62% * invest.


MY CONCLUSIONS:
  -- The IUL plan ate up all of the tax savings that the Government gave me, for using it  (62% vs 64%), BUT
  -- It does give me a different risk profile on my money -- this is valuable to me.
  -- It gave me some insurance as a side benefit -- this has marginal value to me.

-- 2013 -- move $160K from IRA to Roth
        -- Contributed $5.5K post tax to roth

-- 2014

=== SEP IRA ===
- upto 20% thru buisness

=== Simple IRA ===
- $12,000 from employee   1-3% from employer


=== Individual 401K ===
  (will have a roth and non-roth IRA -- )
- either pre-tax or post-tax for the employee contributions
- employer contribution must go to non-roth
- $17,500 + 20% of my share of the earnings
- < 100% of compensation
- Does have more paperwork.

- no income limitations
- when you discontinue the plan then you can roll it over.  (not quite)
## Email to Roger


Roger, 

I want to thank your for your article "Defer or Not" on FPAnet at http://www.fpanet.org/journal/TaxDeferral/  So many pundits provide confusing and sometime contradictory assertions about tax consequences, it is great that you provide such a careful analysis, with worked examples.  Thanks!


After considerable effort, I have been unable to replicate one portion of your article.  That portion is of practical import for me.  On further analysis it seems that the analysis is not quite right.  Since I would like to base my decisions on this bit of analysis, so I am very motivated to get the right answer here.  It would be very valuable if you could look at my very brief analysis of why your assertion is not correct.


First I was unable to replicate your math in section 'When does tax deferral make sense?'  where you consider two ways of investing a lump sum of $100,000.  My results were qualitatively similar to your outcomes (a 12% difference) but I just could not get your specific numbers.

More troubling for me is the assertion you make (which I list in all caps below):

> Today’s IRAs violate at least one of these major assumptions. Under current law, any increase in the value of an 
> IRA, regardless of source, will be taxed at ordinary income rates when the money is withdrawn from the IRA. 
> Today, with the top ordinary rate at 35 percent (federal) and the top capital gains and dividend tax rate at 
> 15 percent, IT IS FAR FROM OBVIOUS THAT DEFERRAL MAKES SENSE, IF DEFERRAL CONVERTS LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAIN OR
> DIVIDEND INCOME INTO ORDINARY INCOME.

It seems to me that is is ALWAYS better to defer taxes as long that the income tax rate remains constant, and capital gains are greater than zero.  (we do not need to concern ourselves with the specific rates, or relation of the rates, or whether gains get moved from income to cap gains, etc.)  It is always true as long as income tax rates to not change:


===ANALYSIS===
Let L be some initial lump sum amount of money available for investment.
Let m be the multiplier resulting from investing any amount, A, for X years of compounding at Y rate of return.
      (NOTE: compounding is super linear in X and Y, but it is a LINEAR function of the initial investment, A.  So there is always some multiplier, m.
Let t be the person's income tax rate

So the IRA payout is:   L *   m   * (1-t)                # the money is multiplied by compounding multiplier 
                                                           and then taxed as income
The Taxable payout is:  L * (1-t) *   m   - capgains     # first income taxes are taken, then multiplied 
                                                           by the compounding multiplier and finally 
                                                           capgains are removed

Roth payout is:         L * (1-t) *   m                  # income taxes are taken, then compounding occurs
                                                           but no cap gains are taken in the end.

CONSEQUENCES:
- ALL cases where income tax ramains constant the IRA is better or as good as Taxable payout
- Shifting to a roth is better when current tax rate LOWER now.
- Staying in an IRA is better when ordinary income rate is LOWER later. 



What is wrong with this analysis?


If nothing is wrong with this analysis then I am unable to square it with assertions you make in the paper, for
example in the executive summary you say:
> [deferral can be better] if certain assumptions are met: tax rates are uniform across income types
> (no difference between capital gain and other income) and constant over time

 ==> but it seems to me there is no dependance on cap gains rates (except that they are not zero)  and it relation to ordinary income tax

you also say:
> Given current tax rates, the compounding benefit of deferral is largely, but not totally, offset 
> by the shifting of long-term gain to ordinary income.

 ==> I cannot understand this calculation as a shifting between long term gains and ordinary income taxing.
     As I understand it, in both cases ever dollar is tax as ordinary income (either before or after)
     the compounding multiplication, but order does not matter here as multiplication is communitive.
     Then in the taxable case, capital gains reduces this amount FURTHER.

 ==> It seems there is no 'shifting' here since in both cases every dollar of the initial amount is subject 
     to income tax... some dollars are just supject to an additional tax.
     (this point is a confusing one, since cap gains are only applied to 'gains' but the way I think
      about this point, is that those gains are already 'tax' since the base was reduced before compounding 
      even began.)



NOTE:  This note is NOT an attack!  I am unsure of myself, but as carefully as I look at this I cannot understand
the flaw in my thinking here.  It seems deferring is always better -- unless ordinary income rises (which of course is possible), but it is the
ONLY way deferring is bad.

NOTE:  In any case, I find your article still quite valuable for its clarity on many point, and because it deals in concrete number more than unsubstantiated assertions.


Any help here would be really valuable for me,

Thanks,
Dan
## old
For example, consider a lump sum of $100,000, on which a taxpayer has two alternatives. First, call it Scenario A, 
he can pay tax today, at 35 percent, and invest the net proceeds in a portfolio of growth stocks that will grow at 5
percent a year compounded, and eventually produce long-term capital gain when sold. 
Second, call it Scenario B, he can put the entire pretax sum in a tax-deferred retirement plan, such as an IRA.
Let’s also assume an average return of 5 percent a year. If tax rates don’t change, after 30 years, when he sells
his stocks under Scenario A, he will net, after paying long-term capital gain tax at 15 percent, $237,000.
 Under Scenario B, when he withdraws the entire balance from his IRA and pays ordinary tax at 35 percent, 
he will net $267,000. 

Scenerio-A -- Invest post tax money.
 100,000 * (1-35%) = 65,000  @ 5% monthly for 30 years   = 300,660 - cap gains = 265,311
   cap gains = (300,660-65000) * 15% = 35349   45099 = 255,561
 100,000 * (1-35%) = 65,000  @ 5% annually for 30 years = 290,403 - cap gains = 256,593
   cap gains = (290,403-65000) * 15% = 33810            = 246,843

Scenerio-B -- Invest in IRA
 100,000  @ 5% monthly for 30 years = 462,555 * (1 - 35%) = 300,660

Notice in ALL cases where income tax ramains constant and capgains is >0 the IRA route is better than the taxable route.

Indeed the different between the two is exactly the capgains paid.
