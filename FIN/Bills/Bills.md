An invoice for $3000 for four coaching/consulting sessions of approximately one hour each is attached.  It is understood that you will email me in advance of each session with an overview summary of the issue; in preparation I will review the summary, your assessment data and possibly some or all of my past notes/our past correspondence.  These sessions will not expire, however it is 
understood that if my rates have increased I will let you know at the time of the request and you will have the option to either pay the delta or receive a refund of the unused sessions.  

I look forward to our ongoing work together!

============


Connie,

I have not heard anything back regarding my final pay.  As I understand it, you have 
taken this over from Fantine.  Here is my accounting of my pay and of the remaining funds
to be paid.

I have added up all of my "non-standard" paid days.  (Those days that are not part of a month at full pay.)
I also added up the two non-standard payments that Aeolus made to me, and show the difference.

The four non-standard pay periods are:
  $15,872  the first 4 days I worked at aeolus
  $65,217  the 18 days in may that I worked as full pay (before Alex lowered all executive compensation)
   $9,057  the remaining 5 days in May working at 1/2 pay
  $41,666  the entire month of June working at 1/2 pay.

The difference between this total $131,812 and $99,205 is what I believe Aeolus still owes me.
Let me know if you agree with this calculation.

(I also included the full history of all payments at the bottom of this email as well for reference)



Pay Delta

 $15,872  4 of 21 days during Oct 2016 @ $83,333/mo

 $ 9,057  5 of 23 days during May 2018 @ $41,666.5/mo

July 6th
It's shocked to hear your resignation recently and today we've remitted the 
salary of June and 4-days salary in 2016 Oct but I caculated it wrong. 
The correct amount should be 55,456 (83,333*4/21+ 83,333*0.5*19/20) 
and I remitted 57,539. Would you please remit 2,083 back to Aeolus HK 
after your receiving?

## Madrone / Ben
3077    =  $1800/31*22 = $1277. (Deposit + Dec rent)   Dec has 31 days, he is here for 22 days starting December 10th.

2016-12-10 -- Ben's Rent $1800/mo for six months.  Ben's deposit = one month's rent
Security deposit is $1800, so the total is $3077.

Dan

Writing this email to document owner compensation 2015-01-01 to 2018-04-30. For the purposes of this email, payroll taxes related to owner salary, retirement account contribution, & fringe benefits will be converted to equivalent cash values.


HERE ARE THE RECORDS OF OWNER COMPENSATION ISSUED BETWEEN (2015-01-01 to 2018-04-30):

$468,521.70 . Nick . Salary ($39,521.70 was payroll tax)
  $8,007.74 . Nick . Health insurance
 $53,000.00 . Nick . 2017 SEP contribution

Total paid to Nick (2015-01-01 to 2018-04-30): $534,476.76
Total paid to Dan  (2015-01-01 to 2018-04-30):   $9,889.81




SOME MISC NOTES:
There are $11,365.69 in owner cell phone bills from 2015-01-01 to 2018-04-30. These are for both Nick & Dan. I did not have time to review the bills to determine how much went to each person.
There were New Dawn Analytics Inc. business activities in 2013 & 2014 resulting in $28,762.95 compensation paid to Nick & $29,776.41 in net income for the company going into 2015. This list does not address pre-2015 activities.
There are additional legal fees between 2015-01-01 to 2018-04-30 that we considered to be fringe benefits for Dan. I did not have time to review the legal bills to understand which payments should be considered fringe benefits for Dan.
Dan gave the company a $44k loan in 2016. This loan will be repaid in full including interest. This email is unrelated to that loan.
Take care

The only other rentals of the larger room come from some guys that were off the books.  I think you were paid directly.  correct?
Any amounts of rent that we obtain this week (for just the large room) should be removed from that amount.
If we did a whole house rental for this week, part of that money should account towards both rooms.
That should cover us.
