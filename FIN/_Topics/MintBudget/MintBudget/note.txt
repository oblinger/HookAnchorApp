

Very happy to have you try out the spreadsheet.

Some people are reporting a problem, but I have yet to be able to
reproduce it on my data.
When you run the sheet, it will prompt to import your CSV file from mint.
when you look at the second sheet (DATA) you should see your data, and
you should see extra columns automatically created off to the right.

some peoples data file does not seem to cause those extra columns to appear.

If that happens to you.  please, please send me the details, so I can
diagnose the problem.
(The sheet is simple, so you can make it do what you want)


cheers,
