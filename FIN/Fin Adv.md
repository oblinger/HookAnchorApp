## MY GOALS

1. Fee-only services.
2. Evidence-based strategy for rebuilding my portfolio post Covid in a high uncertainty, high inflationary environment.
3. Potentially looking for alternate investment to add to the portfolio
4. Might be looking for ongoing management of assets

~~
- Investment strategy that is data. 
- Relationship.  
- Vanilla that you believe in.
- The advising ability:  Better decisions

- 1/2 ETF.  1/2 individual companies.
- Long term:  On the higher side.  1.25% - .9% (2-5) - 
- Full in cost:  tools are so low cost.  tend to be great.
- Text your email.  have the chief investment officer in the meeting.  have an hour for the next call.  Jason, and a senior wealth advisor.
  Jason will bridge the gap of human knowlege.  (quantitiative & qualitative.)
~~

- The Right Advisor:
	- Albion - does not do non-traditional investments
	- Piedemann - Bruce Brugler.  Have to find out if I can.
	- 1.5 B for 500 families.  Cannot give performance data.  turn over next to zero.


- Adjust my whole portfolio for this unique point in time.
	- Would like to hear YOUR firms thoughts about maximizing returns in the current environment.
	- I also have thoughts about the current environment, but would just use these as discussion points where you might easily talk me out of them:
		- Longer term moderate inflation is quite possible.
		- Market contraction may present some buying opportunities.
		- CAPE ratio, present headwinds, limitations on the FED all suggest a more flat next years, perhaps with extra volatility.
- About me
	- Moderately high tolerance for risk
	- Potentially interested in some distant downside risk protection  (up to 30% over 2 years)   or maybe it is too expensive to really pay for....
	- Value outlook - Alternate investment interest.
- Significant Diversity.

- Fee Only.  Hourly (maybe folds into ongoing management)


## QUESTIONS
1. What financial services do you provide?  
2. What licenses or qualifications do you hold?  
3. How would you prepare my financial plan?  
4. What continued services will I receive after the initial plan?  
5. What are your typical clients like, and how have their portfolios performed?  
6. How many clients do you have? What is the average portfolio size?  
7. How have portfolios of clients similar to me (risk, portfolio size) performed?  
8. How have their portfolios performed over the span of one year? Five years? Ten years?  
      (make sure that assessment takes the advisor's fees into account)

1. How is your compensation calculated?  
2. Do you provide a free initial consultation?  
3. Ask for a written estimate of what the fees will be.
