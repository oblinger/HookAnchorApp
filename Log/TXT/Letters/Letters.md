### 2023-04-16  Tim Cook Email


President Cook:

In 2010, After 20 years using Windows, I transitioned to MacOS and soon became one of those fan boys saying things like "once you go mac you never look back" to friends would would still ask me for help in debugging their windows-related issues.  I have bought 6+ iPads, 4+ watches, 6+ laptops since then, Apple TVs, 10+ air pods-pros-max, basically EVERY apple line except home kit.

I am never swayed by arguments that I could get comparable HW for less money. I work in tech, my stuff just needs to work,  24/7, 365-days-a-year.  And Apple's genius-bar support is unmatched by any other vendor; period.


But Apple's repair policies are dramatically failing for power users like myself:
- I have a top-end 2019-mac-pro that is still under apple care.
- I suffered for almost TWO weeks w/o it last year when it went for repair.
- Knowing my issues was intermittent, I told support I will SIMPLY BUY a motherboard replacement in case apple does not want to replace it.
- Support added notes and told me I would get a call .... I never did I simply got my machine back WITH NO SUBSTANTIVE WORK DONE!

     >>>  TWO WEEKS OF DAMAGED WORK FOR NO BENEFIT !!! <<<


- Recently the machine is degrading further.  It reliably overheats with two monitors and and zoom call running.  even in safe mode, all checks done.

- I don't trust apple care with my time again.  This time I went to the store to just directly PAY for a mother board.

NOPE.  not even with my own money, not even for a recent machine, not even one still under apple care.  Its against policy.



Here is the rub:

      APPLE IS NOT VALUING MY TIME NOR MY OCCUPATION


If I still had my Lenovo, I could swap a motherboard in an afternoon and be back up and running that day.   Apple could do this too if they chose too.  No tests, no nothing.  A customer with apple care just bought this board and we are going to put it in.


My only option (and plan this week) is to buy a brand new high end mac pro, even though my current high-end pro IS STILL UNDER APPLE CARE "protection".

I have no choice and that MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL. It is the first time I have seriously questioned my commitment to Apple products. I shouldn't have to buy this new machine when I have a late model one still under apple care!

I understand a company must have blanket policies, but in this case you are NOT putting your customer first.  Even my willingness to pay (when I shouldn't have to) still makes no difference.  This is a real fail!

I need to keep my current machine as my new emergency backup (see below), still I feel you should defray some of its cost as this is a gap in your coverage.  Further you you should consider the live swap idea below.


Thanks for your reading of this,
Dan Oblinger
CTO Sports Visio



Additional Details:

- It takes more than 1.5 days of continuous work to configure all the apps needed on a new machine.  Thus, the Apple Loaner program is of little use in my case -- as you will not swap hard drives.

- I maintain a second previous laptop of mine as a fully configured "emergency" machine, because of Apple's broken policies, but syncing files and updating configurations is still a time-consuming, error prone, and imperfect process.

- Case ID: 101972730928




==> Apple needs a FOR-PAY option to 'live swap' customer machines.

LIVE SWAP PROPOSAL
- An active apple-care user can pay a fixed amount to have their machine 'live swapped'.
- Apple ships an identical refurbished unit to a local store, and 'live swaps' some or all parts WITHOUT TESTING in a couple hours.
- Apple then tests and, if needed, refurbishes the old machine.
- This leaves apple with apple with an identical refurbished machine.
- The incremental cost to apple for this premium process only occurs when no repair was needed.  Thus some fraction of the refurbishment cost must be paid by the customer to cover these cases. 






### 2022-04-06  John Cameron thank you

_John & Pam:_

Out of nowhere Qingling says... do you know a Pam Cameron? Pam?! yeah from grad school, but why? Qingling says: Because she just sent us a really nice baby carrier! huh?!? How did she even know about this??? (how DID you know, I am so terrible at social media I don't think it was even out there?) Anyways, it was a great surprise thanks!!

_Of course then the baby came, right as my startup was getting sold, and we basically blew it with all of our thank-yous for our gifts. I am writing to you now as a very, very, VERY belated thank you. It was by far my favorite baby shower gift, since it was so unexpected._

_I hope your family is well... I look forward to a catch up one of these months. (and of course if you guys are ever in San Francisco, we must meet up!!)_

_much love,_

_Dan and Qingling_
