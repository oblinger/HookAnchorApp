TOPIC: FRIDAY PUSH TO PRODUCTION

@Brian I am reposting this topic in the war room so all can collaborate, but the question is foremost to you.  Given all changes now on stage, what level of testing do we need to do tonight in order to push to production tomorrow?  @mark can get 5 folks I think he said to each annotate a game.  Cloud Factory can annotate games as part of their process over night, this likely gets us another 8 games (is that right Mark?).  And then we can divert MM people away from delivering Games to Cerebro for the evening (we want to minimize this).  But how many MM people / games do we want to divert?  (he has 40 total, so we could divert 5 people for example, is that en ough?). Those who are diverted are still doing productive work, but their results will not go to Cerebro the next day.  What do you think we need?
