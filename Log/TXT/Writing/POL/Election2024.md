You asked the right question, what should democrats do differently next time?

Simple answer, dispense with the demons that the Republicans use to win the middle:

~~
Simple answer, dispense with the demons that the Republicans use to win the middle:

-- CANDIDATE: Pick a candidate the is well liked/trusted by the middle: Obama, Clinton, Regan. Not Hillary, nor Biden

-- IMMIGRATION: The middle worries about losses from this alot. So stop supporting sanctuary cities, even Trumps remain in mexico is worth the trade. Push quotas up, funding to speed immigration, but don't be the party of the "illegal" it kills us.

-- TRANS ISSUES: They are the third rail. Don't touch them, and declare these are all "state issues". Society is progressing left already, just let nature take it course.

-- CLASS WAR: Become the party of the economic underclass. (you think you are, but the middle does not believe you.). This is **ALL** you talk about, this is where your candidates should come from. You know you are 'winning' if every new cycle is about some dem attacking some law sheltering the rich with some rep trying to defend it.

-- CLIMATE: As long as every time you talk about climate you also explain how fixing it will not hurt or help the disadvantaged we can win votes here. (but we need to compromise, e.g. on fracking for example... every KwH produce by natural gas does reduce coal until coal is zero, so it is a compromise we can make in order to win much larger gains in other policies that we are not going to loose!)

These last two are very sellable to America, but the Reps out maneuver us, by using your STUPID words to make the news cycle about trans surgery and not about billionaire tax breaks.


### 2024-11-14  WHY TRUMP


GAH!!!  We will never win if we cannot really understand why we lost:

- Working class voters believe mass immigration harms jobs and costs more in services than it pays.

- They believe the economy is worse than before Biden, so one needs to propose a compelling change we didn't and Trump did (cut 1/2 the "wasteful" gov and deport all the "freeloaders")

- They believe Dems are not listening that trans-rights harms fairness in sports, safety in bathrooms, and should not be surgically fixed using tax money.

- They believe legal attacks on Trump were partisan since they only came from the most liberal courts.


I know we live in a racist/sexist country, still I am also from Trump country and I am telling you the main reasons are listed above.  No point in arguing the stupidity of the points above, one needs a compromise platform that addresses them....   Or just let the other guy run everything.


### 2024-11-11  short

No it does not! It shows we are not listening!!! They worry:

-- MIGRANTS: Millions of migrants will take jobs and burden our services.

-- TRANS: Bathrooms will not be safe, sports will not be fair, and taxes will be misspent on gender affirming care.

-- CANDIDATES: Hillary and Biden were not broadly popular/trusted candidates by the middle, we can pick ones that are.

-- SPEECH: Speech will not be free if the gov pressure twitter on what does and does not count as hate or mis-information.

explaining to me how these concerns are not valid misses the point. Middle American defines what is valid, and those leaders who find the best compromises lead.

WE DID NOT HEED WE DO NOT LEAD.

~~

Here is my list in order of importance:

-- illegal immigration. (this ties to economy)

-- trans issues: bathroom safety. sports fairness. tax dollar on surgery.

-- Partisan attacks on Trump and on free speech

-- Kamala is quite liberal and a less know quantity

### 2024-11-11  Democrats Wake Up! 2


America does not deserve the consequences they are about to receive from this election.  Sure there are ardent Trump supporters that love everything he represents, but much of America simply tolerates him because IN THERE EYES he is better than Dem incompetence on key issues.

A successful leader must find the compromises that allow most constituents to be mostly satisfied.  If you don't represent the interests of your constituents (AS JUDGED BY YOUR CONSTITUENTS) then you don't deserve and wont to lead them.  By this measure we Dems deserved to loose.

As you read these, don't explain in your mind how these claims are wrong, that does not matter!  It only matter that they ARE widely believed and we Dems did little to acknowledge or address them.



THE ECONOMY
American's don't feel they or the economy are doing well, so leaders that actively make this worse are simply disqualified as a viable leaders, no matter what else they do.

IMMIGRATION
Most don't buy arguments that huge numbers of migrants entering our country won't take limited jobs from citizens, and they don't believe these millions won't cost more services than their low wage taxes pay for.  Thus when they see a bus-load of illegally entering migrants being openly released onto our streets BY OUR GOV makes their blood BOIL!!!   Bus loads after bus loads of society-ending mountains of Democratic failure on TV EACH WEEK for four years.  This perceived and actual failure ALONE is enough to entirely disqualify Democrats in the mind of many.

FRACKING
Most citizens view climate and environment as important but not existential.  They want compromises that protect the economy, so Fracking that replaces coal with natural gas is a trade they overwhelmingly want.  In general they want to hear hard talk about how costs are being contained, not just how many smelt are being saved.


TRANS ISSUES
The middle want a society that is fair, safe and prosperous.
-- They don't believe it is FAIR for biological males to compete with bio females
-- They don't think it is SAFE to force bio females to go to the bathroom with biological males.
-- They don't think it is right to use tax money to pay for "gender affirming care."
-- They don't like focus on DEI, and woke pronouns etc.  
  -- They believe Republican claims that federal forcing of DEI has caused ineffective hires
  -- And believe "woke" pronoun etc. concerns prove that leaders don't have their eye on what is important (the economy).


PARTISAN TRUMP ATTACKS:  Legal attacks on Trump have clearly HELPED him!!  But Why?!  Because they are (correctly) seen as a partisan.  If we cannot bring a case which a NEUTRAL or conservative federal judge will prosecute, then we should bring no case as all.  They helped Trump, and they weaken our Democracy as they normalize the use of partisan judges to bring political cases.  (Notice Biden feloniously mis-handled classified documents....   Should we now be throwing him into jail?  a partisan judge might!)


FREE SPEECH
A virologist was banned on twitter for claiming the Corona came from a Wuhan lab.  One politician was banned from twitter for saying "A man cannot give birth" because he was transphobic.  News about hunter-biden's laptop was blocked as mis-information, yet turned out to be true.  We later find that Biden's gov pressured Twitter and others to censure.  THE MIDDLE BELIEVES IN FREE SPEECH, and does not trust liberals to be in charge of what is an is not "mis-information" or "hate speech."



BIDEN'S INFIRMITY
The Dem's inner circle demand one of their own lead the white house, and are willing to risk the presidency to ensure this.  Hillary was KNOWN to be very unpopular, Biden in both terms was KNOWN to be frail in ways that bothered the middle.  We were simply told, "yeah, but its better than the other guys!"

The Democrats lost the 2016 election, Trump did not win it, the same in 2024.
Biden did win in 2020, but it was entirely a "not that other guy" vote, not a vote FOR Biden

Wow Democratic party, is this the best we can do?  We DO deserve to loose BADLY.
But of course America does not deserve what is about to happen to it.  Very sad.

~~

So how could the Democrats won this election handily, AND kept 90% of their principles.
In my opinion they just needed to do a couple of all of the things on this list:

(1) Dems need to just shut up about these "third rail" issues like Trans rights, use of pronouns, or anything else that the Republicans call "woke".  Not because the Republicans are correct.
But because its a fight we are already winning.  Lets not snap defeat from the jaws of victory.
The whole country is already becoming more progressive simply thru our collective beliefs!!  No need for a Federal law about bathrooms or sports.  Just let GRASS ROOT action take its natural course.  Just as Trump defanged his largest weakness (Abortion) by simply saying "I won't pass a federal law on Abortion it is a state issue" the Dems could do the same.  As a party just declare that we don't push values until they are overwhelmingly supported in the nation.  It is really counter to democracy and freedom for one group to FORCE its values on another group.  (and it is an election LOOSER for either Rep or Dem that does it)


(2) This is probably my most controversial idea.  Just like Trump did with Obama care.... he cried how evil it was, yet he left it in place.  Why because too many citizens want it.  In the same way we should have left Trump's "Remain in Mexico" policy in place.






### 2024-11-07  Democrats Wake Up!   ((BEST ONE))

DEMOCRATS WAKE UP!  This loss is not primarily about racism or fascism.  This loss is not about the "orange man."   The middle does not trust him either, its just that they trust us EVEN LESS!  Here are the "lightning rod issues" that I think cost the election:

ECONOMY:  Trump has a simple story on how to fix the economy: illegals, trade, slash gov and tariff China.  Dems need a simply story about how they are going to fix the economy...  not a VP saying:  "I can't thinking of anything I would change!"

ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, sanctuary cities, blocking ICE, using tax dollars for non citizens in any way, when they feel they are hurting.  And mostly not slowing the flow of migrants into the country.

TRANS ISSUES:  Bathroom safety.  Fairness in sports.  Gender surgery.  Unease about increased cultural prominence.

DEI / WOKE PRONOUNS, ETC:  Some don't like this stuff, but most just view it as evidence of Dems not having eye on the ball (the economy) and instead screwing around with stuff that doesn't matter.

PARTISAN TRUMP ATTACKS:  Legal attacks on Trump have HELPED him, since they are is seen as a partisan witch hunt, since they ARE so partisan.

sure we can talk about how misguided those concerns are from the sidelines, or we can hold our nose and compromise to address the concerns of others who see the world differently that we do.


FIRST LETS UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE IN MINDSET:

**ABUNDANCE VS. SCARCITY**.  Liberals come from an abundance mind set, believing one can give more to those in need w/o drastic loss for the rest.  Conservatives come from a zero-sum, scarcity mind set.  Citizens are barely hanging on and cannot give more, plus of our problems stem from too much "free loading" already in the system.

**LAWLESS "RABBLE" VS POWER DYNAMICS.**  Liberals believe society's ills stem from the actions of the powerful over the weak.  Conservatives believe society's ills stem from lawless actions of the "rabble" against productive members of society.

**HUMAN NATURE.**  Liberals believe when humans are bad it is mostly from their environment.  Conservatives believe it is mostly the nature of the bad person.  Thus liberals favors strong support while conservatives favor strong law enforcement.


So how does this difference in mindset relate to these issues:


ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
This issue is far far far far far larger an any liberal can comprehend.  New York times did a great piece on "line cutting", explaining the conservative's rage when Democrats "let" or "assist" non-citizen's to access citizen benefits (roads, schools, medical, etc.).  This issue a triple whammy:
- LOSS: According to a zero-sum mindset every dollar spent is a dollar NOT available to a legitimate citizen.
- FAIRNESS:  They say:  Hey you wanna give charity, fine.  give out of YOUR pocket! get out of mine!  you have no right to squander my birth right away.
- SCARCITY: Worse it is an endless sea of non-citizens, so many that will bankrupt our country.
- RULE OF LAW: They might not be happy with LEGAL immigration of many poor given a scarcity mindset, but they really go BALLISTIC when it is ILLEGAL immigration, and especially when we Dems are INTENTIONALLY not strenuously trying to enforce rule of law.

Many persuadable middle of the road blue collar Americans (of all genders and races) are outraged by "sanctuary cities".  The idea that Democrats would willing ASSIST in the committing of a crime that is critically hurting them personally and economically is by itself fully disqualifying.  IT ALONE IS PROOF THAT DEMS DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM AND DON'T REPRESENT THEM.

Notice FOURTY-ONE percent of hispanics voted for Trump.   FORTY-FREAKING PERCENT!!!  Do you think they like Trump calling them rapists?  Or that they are racist against hispanics themselves??  No, but they do believe in Republican-fairness, in scarcity-based zero-sum benefits, and are on the edge of making it, so they vote Trump.  And if this can push a Mexican to vote for Trump, how much more for the rest of America?!?


So what could Dems do:
-1- First don't call them "undocumented" immigrants, call them "illegal" immigrants.  Softening the language does not change facts on the ground, but it does indicate a stance.  It tells the world you don't think this kind of immigration is an existential issue to solve, it is not a catastrophically bad crime, it is more like J-walking, technically a crime, but not one of massive import.  Middle America does not agree with you, and won't vote for you if you talk that way!
-2- Dump "sanctuary cities" from mainstream Dem thinking and fully support the ICE's role of deporting undocumented migrants.  There WILL be a backlash as businesses don't have the labor needed to run, and we can get a worker program or increase the immigration caps.  I say either we gain support across the nation to pass laws to legally increase immigration or we just don't do it.  Using "gorilla" tactics may help us to win the battles, but looses wars.  They are a modest bandaid, but are fully disqualifying for many.
-3- Keep Trump's "remain in Mexico" policy.  Just like Trump did with Obamacare we can decry the policy but not repeal it.  We could even inject many millions of dollars to make the plight of those waiting in Mexico better.  Democrats were sunk by week-after-week seeing videos of immigrants caught illegally crossing the border then being let loose onto streets of America to "unfairly" take American jobs and use more tax dollars than they earn.  Every week for four years middle America was reminded that Democrats don't give a shit about them.  It killed us.

This ties to the economy for many, and is THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE for many.
Thus we must compromise most significantly in this area if we hope to lead.


TRANS ISSUES
We really hurt our electability over what we see as "obvious" choices on a collection of issues:  Bathroom safety.  Fairness in sports.  "Woke" pronoun usage.  Trans prominence within culture.

I think your suspicious are also correct, many conservatives are "conservative."  They just don't like/approve of trans lifestyles and actions.  We can fret at how backwards they are, but if hope to represent them we must accommodate them.  The good news on this front:  We don't need any Federal laws about these things.  Societal morales are shifting every leftward all by themselves.  Lets take a trick from Trump's book and just say these are "State Issues."  This allows us to have an opinion, but then allow each state to adopt its own values.  Over time they are becoming more progressive.  And boots on the ground rules for sports and bathrooms can be changes one case at a time.

We need to get out of the business of deciding what are the correct values and then trying to legislatively impose them.  A law against murder is acceptable since nearly all of society supports it.  But a law against eating meat would not be since not all agree eating animals should be considered murder.  Trans rights are in that middle ground, we just need to wait for the Overton window to catch up.


PARTISAN TRUMP ATTACKS:  Legal attacks on Trump have clearly HELPED him!!  But Why?!  Because they are (correctly) seen as a partisan.  If we cannot bring a case which a NEUTRAL or conservative federal judge will prosecute, then we should bring no case as all.  They helped Trump, and they weaken our Democracy as they normalize the use of partisan judges to bring political cases.  (Notice Biden feloniously mis-handled classified documents....   Should we now be throwing him into jail?  a partisan judge might!)


FREE SPEECH
A virologist was banned on twitter for claiming the Corona came from a Wuhan lab.  One politician was banned from twitter for saying "A man cannot give birth" because he was transphobic.  News about hunter-biden's laptop was blocked as mis-information, yet turned out to be true.  We later find that Biden's gov pressured Twitter and others to censure.  THE MIDDLE BELIEVES IN FREE SPEECH, and does not trust liberals to be in charge of what is an is not "mis-information" or "hate speech."



BIDEN'S INFIRMITY

The Democrats lost the 2016 election, Trump did not win it, the same in 2024.
Biden did win in 2020, but it was entirely a "not that other guy" vote, not a vote FOR Biden

Wow Democratic party, is this the best we can do?  We DO deserve to loose BADLY.
But of course America does not deserve what is about to happen to it.  Very sad.









.  I don't think they are yet and themselves over what we see as an "obvious" but smaller

Sure the USA gains many large benefits from immigration.



that propelled trump both times and brexit too as in a zero-sum mindset every dollar spend is dollar 



A valid response to this list is to say.  No that is too far.  I would rather loose power than do those things, but an invalid response is to explain how this thinking is "wrong" it does not matter that you think is right or wrong, it matter what that voter thinks is right or wrong.  The only way we get to retain power, AND do what we want



please quit looking at the charlatan that just trounced you, look at your self that is where the problem lies.

I live in SanFran but am from KY.  News flash: we Dems DON'T represent the nation.  Its not that Trump is loved, it is that the Dems are hated/not trusted.

I am not arguing the list below are valid, but I AM arguing they are WIDELY believed and they cost the election.  For me, I would have been happy with a Dem party that gave dramatic ground on these issues, in order to have Harris in office right now.  Perhaps you don't agree and you think we need to remain "pure" (and out of power), but that is not my thought.


DEMOCRATS PLEASE PLEASE WAKE UP!

I reject Trump, yet am from a very Red state and i can tell you we Democrats are VERY out of touch with whats most important to much of America.  We can remain pure, mostly out of power, and console ourselves it is all the fault of those "evil" populists.  Or we can dramatically compromise on a tiny set of "lightening rod" issues and then, while in power, do great good on many others.

Contrary to your thinking, a great many Trump voters are really turned off by many same things that turn you off about him, but they are turned off even more by tone-deaf or "unfair" Democrat policies.  (unfair as they define fairness, not as you define it!)


Let me outline choices that I think would have dramatically flipped this election.
You will hate them all.  But ask yourself, was it really worth loosing to Trump?  I assure you, as I talk with Trumpers, these ARE the issues that sank our battleship, they are not hiding their feelings about these things if we just listen!
