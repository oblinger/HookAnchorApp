yeah, Argentina's economy has been (mostly) destroyed by left-wing populism over the years, unfortunately. Now Argentina's left with a mostly illegal currency exchange system, as legal access to ~stable currencies is very limited.Let me know if you need another contact to exchange dollars or crypto to pesos, I have a good one in the city center as well.
