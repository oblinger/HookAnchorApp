Ben, this topic heads into my area of expertise.

Similar to Dennett or Hofstadter I view qualia is arising from two layers inherent to an intelligence embedded within an agent.

Here it is in a nutshell:

The universal modelling engine builds a model of its input signals. This includes many objects in the physical world and how they operate.

It also include the mental signals of the system it is embedded in. eventually if it lives in human society it learns about formal systems like multiplication and functional modeling.

Indeed it builds a functional model of its own embodiment along with everything else.

Now consider it watching another agent putting it hand in a bucket of ice water. It knows the water is cold, knows about feeling cold, and reasons that this agent must be cold.

Then it puts it own hand into the ice water. Just as before it models that the agent will perceive cold.

But in addition to this, it also has direct perceptual signalling from its hand about that cold.

This experience is parallel to, but far richer than the perceptual representations it has about the hand going in the water.

This modelling system understands this to be a crucial distinction in both sensing and processing.

Some time later a grey haired philosopher defines the word "qualia" to indicate this additional sensing data.

And many other agents vociferously argue that no computational processes can be responsible for qualia, since they all have a strong understanding of computational systems, and they correctly deduce that no matter how accurately one models the physiological reactions of putting you hand it ice, it will not feel like putting your hand in ice.

And this is correct.

If a human or an agent were to perform those calculations they would not feel ice water.

It is only when those sensations are transmitted through their sensory pathways that it FEEL like ice water.

And this would even be true of an simulated robot in a digitally simulated environment.

The summary is as follows:

- Qualia is only qualia for a given agent and only when it arrives within the correct embodiment sensory pathways.

- Consciousness is a kind of qualia that involves a matching of the representational view of the world with the direct sensory data from that same world.

For me, the "self organizing" nature of humans (which is only partially true) is beside the point. But it does require sufficient abstraction in the upper later in order to have anything interesting to match to. Further one needs to have a developed theory of mind in order to be surprised by the matching, and to reason about its causes and conclude there is qualia.

I think a cricket has some of the functional parts perhaps to almost have two levels of representation, but I think it stretch credulity that the cricket would have enough of a theory of mind to conclude that there is an thinking agent in the middle here, and they direct perceptions from that agent is available to the reasoning agent itself.

Humans build very detailed functional/causal models of many things around themselves, thus we should not be surprised that even early man knew there was a "thinker thing" that sat between it eyes and its hands, and that direct access to extra 'qualia' was availble from the body of this thinker thing, and only from this thinker thing.

So I think concluding a 'self' is pretty natural, and not so mysterious.

My primary disappointment with my conclusions above is that I feel I am failing a test that CS Lewis put forward at the end of his book that Abolition of Man. He worried that scientists in understanding mankind would destroy all that is sacred by reducing it to a fully explained scientific phenomenon. If I understood this parenthetical thought correctly, it is a serious admission for such a theist. Since it seems he believed that science would one day explain everything away and leave no room for God or spirituality. He wished for a new kind of science which would explain but build up rather than tear down all that is spiritual. He ended by stating that he hardly understood what he was even asking for.

I loved that humility and his mission speaks to me. I feel we are spiritual creatures and need to understand this world in spiritual terms, so while I don't want to look away from the understanding of consciousness which I think will soon be apparent to many in society once we have computers that exhibit and claim that same sense of consciousness that we have. (which will NOT come from current LLMs, but which I think we will soon invent).

This will be a crisis for humanity. Yet I still feel that even a computed consciousness can be a spiritual one as long as we understand things correctly and have proper expectations for what spiritual means.
