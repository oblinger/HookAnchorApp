## Key Finding

**Liberals and conservatives show equivalent levels of partisan bias.**

## The Data

| Measure | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Studies analyzed | 51 |
| Total participants | 18,000+ |
| Overall partisan bias | r = .245 |
| **Liberals** | **r = .235** |
| **Conservatives** | **r = .255** |
| Difference | 0.02 |

The difference between groups (r = .02) is trivially small and not statistically meaningful.

## What This Means

Both liberals and conservatives:
- Evaluate identical information more favorably when it supports their beliefs
- Are less skeptical of information they want to believe
- Show the same "motivated reasoning" pattern

The researchers concluded: "Liberals and conservatives showed no difference in mean levels of bias across studies."

## Context

This finding challenges earlier claims (some from Kahan's work, some from cognitive style research) suggesting conservatives might be more prone to biased reasoning. The meta-analysis aggregated 51 studies specifically designed to test partisan bias, providing the most comprehensive test of the symmetry hypothesis.

**Note**: A critique by [Baron & Jost (2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691618788876) argued methodological issues may have biased findings toward symmetry. The debate continues.
