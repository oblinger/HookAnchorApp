## Key Finding

**Liberals and conservatives show equivalent levels of partisan bias.**

## The Data

**Meta-analysis:** 51 studies, 18,000+ participants

### Real-World Example: Same Policy, Different Name

When pollsters ask about the exact same healthcare law using different names ([Navigator Research, 2024](https://navigatorresearch.org/the-affordable-care-act-remains-widely-favorable/)):

| Group           | "Affordable Care Act" | "Obamacare"       | Shift   |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| Democrats       | 84% favorable         | 85% favorable     | +1%     |
| Independents    | 46% favorable         | 44% favorable     | -2%     |
| **Republicans** | **34% favorable**     | **25% favorable** | **-9%** |

Republicans are 9 points less favorable to the same policy when it has Obama's name on it. Democrats show no shift - but they're already at 84-85% (ceiling effect).

**Note:** This example shows asymmetry because it tests a *Democratic* policy. To test fairly, you need experiments testing both parties' reactions to policies labeled with opposing party names - which is what the meta-analysis did across 51 studies.

### The Meta-Analysis Result

When you average across 51 experiments measuring partisan bias:

| Group | Bias Level (r) |
|-------|---------------|
| Liberals | .235 |
| Conservatives | .255 |
| **Difference** | **.02** |

Both groups show the same amount of bias. The 0.02 difference is trivially small.

## What This Means

Both liberals and conservatives:
- Evaluate identical information more favorably when it supports their beliefs
- Are less skeptical of information they want to believe
- Show the same "motivated reasoning" pattern

The researchers concluded: "Liberals and conservatives showed no difference in mean levels of bias across studies."

## Context

This finding challenges earlier claims (some from Kahan's work, some from cognitive style research) suggesting conservatives might be more prone to biased reasoning. The meta-analysis aggregated 51 studies specifically designed to test partisan bias, providing the most comprehensive test of the symmetry hypothesis.

**Note**: A critique by [Baron & Jost (2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691618788876) argued methodological issues may have biased findings toward symmetry. The debate continues.
