### 2025-02-25  Newest "Catch-22" version

TODAY’S CATCH-22
(1) Israel holds all the cards and will not accept any change that notably lowers their security.
(2) A percentage of Palestinians currently want to wipe Israel from the map. No matter what wealth or concessions are given, too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much of a feeling of lands stolen. For them its nothing less than “river to sea”!
(3) Thus today a two state solution cannot work: either (a) Palestinians must be oppressed so thoroughly that it is difficult to obtain any money or resources to launch an attack, or (b) monitored so carefully that they cannot marshal the resources they have to launch an attack.
(4) Many argue this forcible control is a necessary evil. Even if true, Israel and Egypt are still guilty of meting out horrendous collective punishment against many innocents Palestinians.

Here I propose a way out of this catch-22, by incrementally provided prosperity and freedom to Palestinians in small increments in order to increase demonstrated willingness and ability to ensure Israeli security. This plan requires some Palestinians to put faith in the plan first while Israel takes on no risks initially and makes no long term guarantees, they simply allow the plan and help to fund it. This strikes many as deeply unfair — perhaps so, but Israel holds all the cards and lives in relative safety / prosperity today. They have no reason to meet Palestinians half way, and have demonstrated they NEVER WILL.

This plan first creates the conditions where Palestinians have the collective desire and ability to ensure Israel’s security. Over years and decades incremental freedoms are added while maintaining higher levels of security than Israel has today. After decades of proving they can ensure Israel’s security better than Israel can, they negotiate for full independence. There is no guarantee they can get it, but with a decades of proof that they are better and ensuring Israel’s security there is little reason not to give this independence and international pressure will be immense since they will no longer have the “excuse” of security to fall back upon as they have today.

The key insight of this article is to notice that the choice of peace cannot be offered to the Palestinians as a whole, since we are asking for faith and effort from Palestinians it must be offered as an individual choice with individual consequences. Greater freedom and prosperity cannot be offered to a people as a whole, if those people as a whole are not committed to non-violence against Israel. Palestinians are not monolith, if given the choice some (many?) would choose to provide Israeli security in exchange for prosperity for themselves and their children.

So how might this work? Each Palestinian family is given a personal choice with personal consequences: Stay where they are today, or move into a separated “Pro-Israel” enclave within the Gaza territory. Families that voluntarily join this enclave must commit to ensuring Israeli security from attack. This means a commitment to accepting significant security checking, mostly by the Enclave itself, and second from Israel and the international community as well. With heavy checking, this enclave would be LESS of a threat to Israel than the rest of the territories as it is actively cooperating with the checking required. The first line of security checking would be managed by the enclave itself. This lowers costs and also helps ensure that checking is done in ways that preserves dignity and civility. This first line is also done in coordination with Israeli and international community to ensure everything is done rigorously. Since this entire enclave has committed itself to ensuring Israeli security, these checks become something analogous to the indignities innocent travelers voluntarily accept at an airport in order to ensure the security of all. It is not exactly the same; it is more invasive and it is done for the security of someone else. Still it is the type of indignity that one might accept as a practical necessity if the payoff were economic escape from the prison of Gaza.

Many Israelis have told me “This will never work, no Gazan will ever sign up for this!” I think they are wrong, I think many in Gaza feel hopeless knowing there is no practical path for freedom for themselves, their children, or their children’s children. Given a way out, some will take it and I think once others saw benefit, many would follow. But regardless if I am correct, simply OFFERING a way out is crucial for Israel. It shows with concrete, practical action that Israel would be a great friend to all Gazan’s who were truly committed to its security. This would dramatically help Israel around the world and with its Arab neighbors. Anyone who says. “Israel is not serious about offering peace and prosperity to Gazans” would be proven wrong every day it supported an enclave with an open door policy for all who accept and protect Israel.

Of course there would be real work for Israel, Egypt, USA, and other partners: It is not enough to provide a hunk of dirt for those few willing to vouch for Israeli security, they must get basic prosperity in return. Good jobs with good trading relations. This is easier to provide to a population that is actively supporting security, still efforts and funds must be made available. Iran funds Hamas in (small) part to build schools and such. The west must spend MORE in trade + aid to build out businesses so coming to the enclave really is escaping to a better life.

The idea is to allow this enclave to start small. The costs will be low, and our ability to instill a strong sense of ensuring security is built in from day one. You don’t like it, you’re out! Everyone in the enclave understands its very existence and the existence of all those good jobs, stability, healthcare and schools are predicated on its ability to police itself. If the enclave fails in this, it fails to exist.

Societal groups have a way of building-in self-reinforcing ways of thinking. Hamas builds a society predicated on hatred of Israel and it fosters that world view. Native Americans in the USA are often deeply offended by the injustice meted out to them in the past and sometime the present. Still very very few would support vigilante justice against the USA — they know how harmful the reaction would be towards their community. In the same way, and enclave of Gazans whose job, school, and community are all predicated on Israel’s safety will be come quite concerned about that safety. Not for love of Israel, rather for love of their children! Over time cultures change, just as they changed for the Arab-Israeli citizens today, they can change for those Gazans benefiting from partnership with Israel.

Once a self-policing Gaza has proven it can ensure the safety from any attacks coming from within its borders, I believe a strong two state solution can be proposed that Israel will accept. Why not? Their security has long been assured. But I believe Israel will never loosen the reigns of control, first, but rather only long after their long term security has been proven in practice. It may not be fair, but 70+ years have proven the first risks will not be taken by Israel. It not about what it right, it’s about what can work.

There are many practical aspects of this idea that I have left out. (e.g. buying the land, managing saboteurs, etc.). I leave those for a subsequent article. For now I would love to just get feedback about the idea.

### 2025-01-26  Response to Chris

Here's a real model of what has worked in the past: Japan after WWII. The US rebuilt the country, created an economy and bought its goods, so that they could thrive, not just survive. Now Japan is a great ally, not a feeble occupied territory.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_economic_miracle
I imagine that the Japanese hated the US very much during the war. At least as much as the Palestinians hate Israel. So I dispute your context #2. (Besides, every bit of it could reworded and applied to Israel, so let's hope you're open to deleting #2, to make room for workable possibilities.)
Money makes peace happen. Not walls or checkpoints. Having something to live for replaces "something to die for." Rich societies are inherently peaceful societies, (when it's somewhat fairly distributed).
Your solution touches upon the need for "good jobs" but that is insufficient. A thriving society needs its share of riches too. Riches that make life beautiful, not just tolerable. Riches that moderate religion and racism and nationalism. Riches that compound, fueling real hope and generational thinking, instead of desperation and reactive violence.
So instead of building a new occupied territory, Israel should build a huge business district, with real lucrative companies, to be owned, managed, and worked by Palestinians. And Israel should be their #1 customer. Now then, that's something any Palestinian would sign up for (and defend from extremists), and Israel would finally have peace. Without checkpoints, or attacks. (No rich country would dare attack their #1 customer.)

First, let me simply thank you for engagement on this topic. On both sides most entirely blame the other side and have little interest in novel solutions.  Cudos for being open to thinking about it!  I wrote this post with the Israeli reader in mind, since they must be won over in order for such an idea to be tried.  Still this cause me to leave out a final section that others have push me on.  Your push was enough for me to add it near the end:




~~

Once a self-policing Gaza has proven it can ensure the safety of Israel from attacks coming from within its borders, I believe a strong two state solution can be proposed that Israel will accept. Why not? Their security has long since been assured. But I believe Israel will never loosen the reigns of control, FIRST, but only long after their long term security has been proven IN PRACTICE, so we need to achieve that first. It not about what it right, it's about what can and cannot work.

~~




I also added the word "currently" to my claim #2.  Indeed I think you and I both hope that such sentiment might change in Gaza, here is my updated claim:




(2) A percentage of Palestinians CURRENTLY want to wipe Israel from the map. No matter what wealth or concessions are given in the short term, too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much of a feeling of lands stolen. For them its nothing less than "river to sea"!




~~

I think you are pushing me to acknowledge that #2 is not fixed for all time, but might change over time, and like Japanese did, might radically transform over time.  Then consider me converted!!  I do agree with you that such feeling CAN change over time.  And indeed I blame Israel that current conditions in Gaza and West bank actually FOSTER rather than reduce such tensions.




Still I think we need to acknowledge some differences with the US occupation.  The Japanese believed that God ordained that they should win that war, they believe they were in the right and might would prove them victorious.  Further, many on the islands resisted capture literally until their deaths, because they were told the American were animals that would rape and kill and plunder.  When we did not do that, it really generated quite a shift in thinking.

**BUT** America was not build upon lands that Japanese thought was theirs.  We did not "steal" from them, and they "attacked us first" so a narrative of a righteous vengeance was not in the populace.




We need to acknowledge that we are starting from a tougher spot here in Gaza.  Many DO feel lands stolen! And even with prosperity already provided by Israel (which has happened to some extent) it is not enough to shake that feeling.  My guess is that for at least one generation, there will be a significant minority that feel strongly enough that WILL act to attack Israel when given the chance.  Certainly, right now we have dramatic proof, it is true in the present.  Indeed Hamas' written manifesto is unconditional, Israel must go!




So I am arguing that #2 is PRESENTLY true, and will be true for the immediate future.  (not sure if you accept that).  Either way, I am hopeful (like you) that this sentiment could change over time with prosperity and beauty.  And I agree with you that it is up to the rest of the world (and Israel) to provide that prosperity, at least for a period.




The challenge is how to provide that prosperity w/o enabling immediate attacks on Israel.  This is the crux of my approach.  




The reality is that nothing will happen that Israel does not ok first.  And even liberal Israeli's will not OK anything that does not ensure their safety in the short run.  Thus I think the only path is one that first:

(1) provides solid security for Israel, 

(2) then affords prosperity and beauty for Gaza and West Bank supported by the world, 

(3) finally self-sufficient self-policing region negotiates for its independence while making promises of Israeli security (promises it has already proven it can keep.)







I think this broad outline matches the Japanese case fairly well.  I add the last paragraph now in order to more fully show the parallel.  Still I think we cannot under-estimate the larger headwind in this case.  An entire generation has grown up dramatically oppressed by Israel.  This was not true for Japanese.  Many many would love to just kill as many Israeli's as they could, and many feel maximum death is their best chance for freedom.  I am confident this belief is wrong, still I acknowledge it is a VERY VERY strong, and wont go away quickly.




Thoughts?









I think one can only give 


Now let me react to your post:  First I agree with a number of parallels to the Japanese situation, the US occupation offered prosperity and beauty and left the country stronger than it found it.  This had a strong favorable effect just as you suggest.

Second, there had to be hate in Japan that softened over the years of prosperity with 

Now to the differences:  with some justification many in Gaza feel the lands that israel are founded on were stolen from them. No one in Japan viewed US territories as stolen from them.  So getting to a place where 100% of Gazans are ok with the existence of Israel is going to be HARD HARD HARD.  We are far from such a thing.  Indeed many in the world feel it is simply not fair.  I intentionally make no comment on whether this is or is not fair, but it is a LARGE impediment to peace.  Even if Gazan's found freedom and prosperity there would be a minority who will tell you loud and clear today that this is not enough.  The lands must be returned.

Now you might claim that a generation later after prosperity was achieved these folks would accept the existence of Israel.  Neither you nor I really know if this might be true, but it is far far far from true today.  Think about the attack Hamas made recently.  Everyone knew that Netanyahu would turn Gaza into a parking lot of rubble.  Indeed Hamas prepared for this by building long tunnels within the territory so they could operate even after the entire region was reduce to rubble.  That was a known consequence of this action.  Yet it was taken.

So we have to acknowledge that at least presently many in Hamas (and beyond) are ready to sacrifice themselves and their citizens in order to attack Israel.  Not claiming anything about correctness of this, just the reality of this.

Now I am not a fatalist.  I am hopeful that a generation of Gazans who had beauty and prosperity in their lives, the might leave this retribution thinking behind.
But claiming that Gazans already have left this behind is willful disregard from apparent facts.

This is my one-two planning.  First we have a prosperous occupied territory, THEN we have a free Palenstine as a second step.
(I should have added this step as a one sentence at the end of my post)


But for me the key idea is that presently #2 is true, and thus physical means would be translated into physical aggression. 
And second Israel holds all the cards, so any planning for a way out must account for this, and be acceptable to Israel along the way.

But I do agree that Israelis (e. g. settlers) sometimes translate capacity into violence.





### 2024-12-06  Response to Steve

I agree. I am not trying to defend Israel's actions in Gaza and West bank. I am focused on Israel's right to control the kind of country it will become.  And what responsibility does a nation have towards non-citizens.

The USA has immigration caps that are set on a country by country basis.  Certainly there are cultural, economic, and racial consequences of how those caps are set.  In the USA we have prohibitions against racial biases toward citizens, but those prohibitions do not apply to non-citizens, so these caps are allowed.

I have objections trying to prohibit such rules.

The first is a pragmatic challenge.  Personally I think humans are extremely differentiating by nature and it would take extreme measures to beat this out of us, and i would not want to do that, even thought i acknowledge the damage done by this differentiation.  Men often are attracted to women.  Sport fans tend to aggregate, etc.  Driving differentiation and tribalism out of humanity does not seem to be the goal here.  (Managing its worst effects is a good goal).

Iraq is formed 






In the USA private clubs are given broad license to shape their membership and maintain cultural norms.



Nearly any policy one adopts on most any issue, will adversely affect some population (often a minority population) in some way (e.g. an adjustment of minimum wage).  Thus I would never claim there are no losers when a Democracy makes choices.






### 2024-11-14  Tighter Intro

The two state solution for Palestinian freedom simply cannot work:

Israeli's will never lift their boot off the necks of the Palestinians when a percentage will immediately use those new freedoms to maximize Israeli death.

And the percent of Palestinians ready to kill Israelis can't drop to zero while the Israeli boot is firmly on their neck.

This is an unbreakable deadlock.  Concessions might lower the percentage, but not close enough to zero to allow lifting of the boot.  And without lifting the boot, how much concession can one make?  Not enough.


The solution it to split Palestinians into a third group where individals can SELF SELECT to align with Israel.  Over time





### 2024-04-12  Dillion updates to the plan

Dillon, your response was so good it merited my thinking before responding.  Sorry I took so long!

RECONSTITUTION -- I agree on the challenge of reconstitution, in Iraq the US screwed up by not restructuring.  But Afghanistan is the better analog to Gaza.  Just as with Gaza there really was no strong local pro-israel, pro-US institutions to work with, AND in both cases you have a subset of the population ready to die rather than align.  This position is a non-starter restructuring, you can never mold such a population into a partner for peace--they believe Israel should not be there... and for some/many we are not changing that belief.

So I think reconstitution is the only path for a real partner, and further it can only be done slowly, and only with the subset of Palestinians.  This is less than everyone wants, but I think it is the most that can be achieved in the medium term.

But let me update/clarify the proposal so it does not trip over the objections you raised:
- It should be a coalition of nations provide favored trading, direct funding, and governmental setup assistance.
  (for legitimacy the US should pressure Arab nations to be central.  Israel should be part of but leading this)
- The enclave progressively becomes self-governing and self-policing ultimately becoming a separate state.
- Enclave is only populated by those willing to accept Israel and willing to help ensure her safety as the price they are willing to pay for their freedom.

--> Benefits of this path
- Just as with Iraq, it is not possible to setup a government over a population where many citizens in that population are actively against the goals of that government, as we saw in Iraq, this cannot work long term.  My approach provides a path for the subset of Palestinians willing to accept need to keep Israel secure with a path.  
- Segregating by willingness to keep Israel secure allows israel to safely allow prosperity and freedom w/o risking another Oct-7th, trying to give prosperity and freedom to citizens that include many who would do harm is far more risky.  (and I think Israel just wont do it.)
- Over time if the enclave is far more prosperous because of its thriving trade etc.  I think many Palestinians will see it as their personal path to freedom and embrace it and Israel's security too.  (of course those who continue to want to fight Israel to the death will be oppressed by Israel, and she will deny them any freedom to act or grow, just as she does today)

There are many practical "details" not covered here, but I think the biggest one is about money.  Today Iran funds Hamas to build hospitals and schools.  Aligned nations need to outspend Iran and build better trade, better schools in this enclave.  If we want Palestinians to favor our path, we need to meet them half way, we cannot allow Iran to outspend us.  And this is a happy situation:  Iran funds the rest of Gaza, but Iran is quite limited in ability to foster trade & freedoms etc.  Meanwhile the aligned nations allow great trade and direct funding to a growing Enclave.  If we cannot beat Iran at this game, we are not trying.  Meanwhile the Gazans on both sides will benefit.  




### Porto Rican

I did make my comment in good faith, but as you suspected, I am pretty clueless about Porto Rican history or prospects, so I am not surprised (or offended) that you might be critical of my off hand ideas.  (I hope you are not either.)

#1 For me I was not assuming it was political condition, but rather economic.  If a human is born with access to certain jobs, education, and prospects they do better than others who don't have them.  So I (naively?) assumed US access was worth a lot.

If the USA was much worse off than London, I think I would want my kids to have access to London---but maybe I would not, maybe I would not, maybe I cannot imagine not being a citizen of the the big guy, so my ability to predict how I would feel is faulty?  I cannot know.

#2 spot on.  I assumed access to the USA would be a hands down win. if that is not true, well that would change my opinion.

#3 I don't assume it is because it is a small nation of Latinos.  As you say other small nations (like Singapore) have done quite well.  But they generally do it by having something the rest of the world wants, and they have really good set of big guy allies so they don't get shoved around.  (and even this it is still tricky to maintain)

#4 you say the USA would be "propping up" the economy.  Maybe that would be so, but maybe not.  I would not say the USA is "propping up" New Hampshire even though it is a tiny state of the union.  It is tiny, but per capita is cost/benefit is ok.  The same could end up true of Porto Rico.

The big thing is that it would trade much of its unique culture for the US melting pot, just as Hawaii did.  I can understand if that is not your thing... its not an economic argument, it is really a cultural one.  I cannot argue against that, it is really a personal value call.

#5 No question we cannot really look at the past 125 years and pretend the USA did not have dramatic effect--of course it did.  both positive and negative I am sure.  My assumption was based on a very naive view of a generic small island nation w/o strong resources would fair in the world by considering others in similar circumstance.  But I am certain you know many more details so perhaps my generic assumptions are deeply flawed?  I would only caution to not consider the question with rose colored glasses.  (At least if economic prosperity is a critical factor for you, perhaps cultural factor trump those.)





### 2024-02-11  Andrew's response

Andrew, I am enormously grateful for your detailed thoughts.  Here are some response, subject to your available time I love to hear your reaction to them:





THIS PLAN DOES NOT SEEM TO REQUIRE BALANCED SACRIFICES

True.  But Israel holds all the cards, they need not (and have not) made great sacrifices.
My aims are (1) immediate, large benefit for those Palestinians to join the Enclave.  (2) a pathway towards a Palestinian State. (3) with !ZERO! reduction in Israeli security.  Not because that is fair, but because it is the only way forward.

Still it should be noted that this is not a free ride for Israel.  Palestinians live in relative poverty at only 1/10th the per capita income of Israel.  Still its population is more than HALF of Israel's.  So it will not be cheap for Israel (and partners) build a prosperous enclave...  They are not getting off scott free, and they are delivering the thing of greatest immediate value:  prosperity.


BUT WHERE DOES ALL THIS GO?

Suffrage, passports in Israel?  No way.  Israel will never accept that loss of democratic control.  But I need to add to my post to explain the pathway:

(0) PARTNERSHIP COUNCIL:  Creation of the oversight council.  These partners that will advocate-for and pay-for the enclave.  
(e.g. Israel, Egypt, USA, EU, maybe Jordan, UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia)
(1) IMMEDIATE:  Stability and prosperity for Palestinians who join.  Immediate security for Israel.  Immediate payments & favorable trade w/ partners. 
(2) PROGRESSIVE FREEDOMS:  Enclave must prove to the council it can maintain security while increasing freedoms.
- Can it import concrete w/o tunnels being built?  Can members travel abroad w/o committing terror or bring weapons back? etc.
- Of course its not fair that each freedom only comes after proving to safety an external authority who might say no with out recourse.
- But it is much better than now!  Today Israel is the entire council.  And Hamas lives in your enclave, so what chance to you have to prove the concrete will not get used for tunnels.  None!  Its a step forward.  how big?  hard to say, but if the enclave really can ensure security, it will be politically hard for these partners to keep denying freedoms, and why should they?  Security really is the issue at hand.  
(3) STATEHOOD:  Statehood would be granted on a progressive and provisional basis.  At core, the issue is the enclave's ability to govern itself and to maintain security.  As it proved year after year it could do this with stability and strength there would be little reason not to allow it all the trappings of statehood, on the provisional basis that it does not backslide.  For many decades it would be economically dependent upon its partnership council and would still be more like a protectorate than a fully sovereign state.  At a practical level this would make very little difference to it citizens.  They would vote, would have their own fully autonomous government within whatever ....



WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO NEVER JOIN

Those who never recognized the right for Israel to exist, and who fight on for a "better deal" with Israel, e. g. the right of return within Israeli territory, etc. are effectively at war with Israel.  That is their right.  We cannot deny them the right to say "Israel stole our lands and we will not rest until we have them back!"  But barring Allah descent into their midst to make things right, their plight in this fight is quite sad and quite predictable.

Human & Israeli history both show that a us stronger powers never sacrifices its security or territory unless compelled to do so; even when they are clearly in the wrong.  Gandhi and Martin Luther King both demonstrated that democracies cave cave into PEACEFUL protests of their injustices by those who pose no physical threat.  Over time I think the enclave will prove itself to be more effective at securing concessions from Israel (even on behalf of those OUTSIDE the enclave) than those still waging war against Israel.  If real progress is made via this peaceful path while those at war have little to show it will dramatically undercut the argument that armed resistance it the better path.  But this must be shown with ACTION -- and that can only occur with a partner committed to non-violence and security.

One would hope eventually the zealous group would simply shrink down to a tiny core who were willing generation after generation to sacrifice their children's lives in the hopes that Allah will come to bolster their efforts.

DOES IT STILL FEEL HORRIFIC WITH THE CONTINGENT PATH TO STATEHOOD








### 2024-02-09  Try Number Three

CONTEXT
(1) Israel holds all the cards and will not accept any change that notably risks lowering their security as they see it.  FULL STOP.
(2) A percentage of Palestinians want to wipe Israel from the map.  No matter what wealth or concessions are given, too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much of a feeling of lands stolen.  For them its nothing less than "river to sea"!  FULL STOP.
(3) Thus a two state solution simply cannot work.  FULL STOP.  As long at #1 and #2 are true we guaranteed that (a) Palestinians will be oppressed so thoroughly that it is difficult for them to obtain any money or resources to launch an attack, and (b) monitored so carefully that they cannot marshal the resources they do have to launch an attack.
(4) Here I propose a "way out" and it is the ONLY way out as long at #1 and #2 are true.  Sure it is far less than what Palestinians want, but it is the only thing they can get unless they can change #1 or #2 (which I don't think they can do.)


The key insight is to notice that the choice of peace cannot be offered to the Palestinians as a whole, rather it must be offered as an individual choice with individual consequences.  Greater freedom and prosperity cannot be offered to a people as a whole, if those people as a whole are not committed to non-violence against Israel.  Yet human population is a monolith, if given the choice some (many?) would choose Israeli security in exchange for prosperity for themselves and their children. 

So how might this work?  Each Palestinian family is given a *personal* choice with *personal* consequences: Stay where they are today, or move into a separated “Pro-Israel” enclave within the Gaza territory. Families that voluntarily join this enclave must commit to ensuring Israeli security from attack.  This means a commitment to accepting significant security checking, first from by the Enclave itself, and second from Israel and the international community as well.  With heavy checking, this enclave would be LESS of a threat to Israel than the rest of the territories as it is actively cooperating with the checking required.  The first line of security checking would be managed by the enclave itself.  This lowers costs and also helps ensure that checking is done in ways that preserves dignity and civility.  This first line is also done in tight coordination with Israeli and international community to ensure everything is done rigorously.  Since this entire enclave has committed itself to ensuring Israeli security, these checks become something analogous to the indignities innocent travelers voluntarily accept at an airport in order to ensure the security of all.  It is not exactly the same; it is more invasive and it is done for the security of someone else.  Still it is the type of indignity that one might accept as a practical necessity if the payoff were economic escape from the prison of Gaza.

Many Israelis have told me "This will never work, no Gazan will ever sign up for this!"  I think they are wrong, I think many in Gazan feel hopeless knowing there is no practical path for freedom for themselves, their children, or their children's children.  Given a way out, some will take it and I think once others saw benefit, many would follow.  But regardless if I am correct, simply OFFERING a way out is crucial for Israel.  It shows with concrete, practical action that Israel would be a great friend to all Gazan's who were truly committed to its security.  This would dramatically help Israel around the world and with its Arab neighbors.  Anyone who says. "Israel is not serious about offering peace and prosperity to Gazans" would be proven wrong every day it supported an enclave with an open door policy for all who accept and protect Israel.

Of course there would be real work for Israel, Egypt, USA, and other partners:  It is not enough to provide a hunk of dirt for those few willing to vouch for Israeli security, they must get BASIC PROSPERITY in return.  Good jobs with good trading relations.  This is easier to provide to a population that is actively supporting security, still efforts and funds must be made available.  Iran funds Hamas in (small) part to build schools and such.  We must spend MORE in trade and aid to build out businesses so coming to the enclave really is escaping to a better life.  

The idea is to allow this enclave to start small.  The costs will be low, and our ability to instill a strong sense of ensuring security is built in from day one.  You don't like it, you're out!  Everyone in the enclave understands its very existence and the existence of all those good jobs, stability, and schools are predicated on its ability to police itself.  If it fails in this, it fails to exist.  

Societal groups have a way of building-in self-reinforcing ways of thinking.  Hamas builds a society predicated on hatred of Israel and it fosters that world view.  Native Americans in the USA are often deeply offended by the injustice meted out to them in the past and sometime the present.  Still very very few would support vigilante justice against the USA -- they know how harmful the reaction would be towards their community.  In the same way, and enclave of Gazans whose job, school, and community are all predicated on Israel's safety will be come quite concerned about that safety.  Not for love of Israel, rather for love of their children!  Over time cultures change, just as they changed for the Arab-Israeli citizens today, they can change for those Gazans benefitting from partnership with Israel.

There are many practical aspects of this idea that I have left out.  (e.g. buying the land, managing saboteurs, etc.). I leave those for a subsequent article.  For now I would love to just get feedback about the idea.


Stable governance, good schools, and medical etc.  All supported and guided by the partners.  



---now it has offered a real and practical way out!


It seems the international community and Israel would gladly partner with such an enclave, indeed most everyone would support such a group. Fostering peace would be a simple a fostering jobs within this enclave. As families realized their jobs were only as secure as their ability to keep their enclave free from Israel-attackers, they would become VERY motivated to keep such folks out! I am sure they would not be 100% effective, still they will be much more effective in policing themselves than Israel is today in policing from afar and operating AGAINST the wishes of the people they hope to control. This is a net gain in security for Israel from day one, and it only gets better over time.





Still they do not get their separate state and they must collaborate to ensure the security of Israel, why would any Palestinian agree to this?!  Prosperity.  Imagine your are born in prison and you and your children will die in that same prison.  Some will not be willing to suicide their life and the life of their children to continue the futile quest to destroy Israel---pragmatically they will choose peace and life, even a life with many "airport checks".  Some Israeli's tell me that NO ONE will accept these terms and none will volunteer to join this Enclave.  I don't believe that, but even if it is true, it is our moral obligation to give those that have no intention of harming Israel or support those that do, to escape the endless punishment we are placing upon them and their dependents.  And empty enclave would be proof to the world that the murderous intent extends across the whole of the population.

Instead I think a different thing would happen.  A tiny and prosperous community would form and would live in peace.  It would be a "weird" piece since it requires careful monitoring.  But children would go to school, bakeries would open, jobs are had, lives are lived.  Once the reality of personal life benefits became real and visible, I predict concern over whether the capital was in Jerusalem or such would fade into the distance, as would the desire to blow up Israel at least among those that enjoyed that prosperity.  The flood gates would open and more would want to join this prosperity, accept the required monitoring.

Ironically I also believe this path is the best one for a truly independent Palestine.  Israeli's hold all the cards, and they are never going to allow a separate state if they cannot fully trust the intentions of that state.  No trust, no state.  An enclave built in this way is better than any alternative I can think of in incrementally proving its ability to ensure Israeli security.  Will that work, I don't know, but I know the alternative cannot ever work.




Still some might counter that its not fair that Palestinians should be required to swear an oath to protect Israel and to suffer the monitoring needed to ensure compliance. I would agree, but is seems a tiny price compared with the Palestinian treatment today!

Once this tiny starter group had proven itself capable of carefully monitoring itself, Israel could relax restrictions on this enclave’s travel and it commerce. This, plus international investment, could make the enclave quite attractive. Over time more and more Palestinians might choose to move into this enclave, once it was shown it could be a path to a “post-prison” future for themselves and their children. Perhaps over time the enclave could evolve into a protectorate of Israel. A self-governing country that had all freedoms of other countries except its defense was handled by Israel. 

Some might also counter that Palestinians need violence to be heard by an Israel regarding unfair access to water and many other practical issues. I disagree, since this group is not a security threat Israel cannot use that excuse to limit the group, and their voice would be purer and more universally supported in Israel and on the international stage. They would be _more_ able, not _less_ able, to lobby for real change. Since the founding of Israel, violence has ALWAYS resulted in a loss for the Palestinians.

I have thoughts about how one might manage the buying of land to create such an enclave as well as some thoughts about how to handle groups that would specifically try to destroy such an enclave. But first I thought I might want to get reactions to the idea itself. So… what about a three state solution?


### 2023-12-23  Try Number two -

TL;DR
(1) Israel holds all the cards and will not accept any change that notably lowers their security.
(2) A percentage of Palestinians want to wipe Israel from the map.  No matter what wealth or concessions are given, too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much of a feeling of lands stolen.  For them its nothing less than "river to sea"!
(3) Therefore either (a) Palestinians must be oppressed so thoroughly that it is difficult to obtain any money or other resources to launch an attack, or (b) monitored so carefully that they cannot marshal the resources they have to launch an attack.

Given these harsh realities I propose a voluntary "way out" for Palestinians that provides for near term prosperity and stability.
My "way out" is far less than what Palestinians want, so it will never be accepted by all, rather it is a personal choice made by individual families to opt out of the current conflict.




Here is the nub of the problem: Even if Israel showered benefit and wealth upon Gaza there would still be 1% that would use any new found freedoms and wealth to try to wipe Israel from the map! There is too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much honest feelings of having lands stolen. So Israel is never going to cede security control over these territories---it would be irrational for them to do it will 1% continued to want to kill them.  On the other side Palestinians know that they are prisoners on their own land; they know their children’s children may well die as prisoners on that same land. Without any hope in sight many see crazy-drastic action as the only reasonable response.

Palestinian sympathizers claim if they had prosperity and basic freedoms they would accept Israel as a peaceful neighbor, while those on the other side say the Palestinians never will.  As with all such questions about a large groups of people, the answer is somewhere in the middle: some would trade prosperity instead of a continuing quest to destroy israel, and others would not.  We are all morally obliged to give those who would choose peace and prosperity the option to choose that path, if we can do that in safety.  And we can:



My solution is to give each Palestinian family a choice with personal consequences: Stay where they are today, or move into a separated “Pro-Israel” enclave within their territory. Families that voluntarily join this enclave must commit to ensuring Israeli security from attack by their enclave.  This means a commitment to accepting significant security checking first from within by the Enclave itself and second from Israel too.

The enclave itself would help ensure the checking was done in ways that preserved dignity and civility, but also would ensure they were rigorously done.  It is analogous to the indignities innocent travelers voluntarily accept when flying on a plane in order to ensure security of all.  It is not exactly the same---this is more invasive and it is done for the security of someone else.  But still it is the type of indignity that one might accept as a practical necessity if the payoff were economic escape from the prison of Gaza.

### 2023-12-17  Response to Nadav

Nadav,

I really appreciate you humoring the westerner here. Thank you!

I think there are two key differences with the Oslo accords:

First, among those Palestinians who were given autonomy in 2005 there were many who still promised to wipe Israel from the map, they never rescinded that promise. No surprise, when given the chance they try to fulfill it! I propose an Enclave where membership requires and oath to proactively protect everyone including Israel from terrorism. Some will certainly lie but I think many who willing to agree to the crazy terms of this enclave will not be lying.

Second, I am not proposing that Israel needs to reduce its surveillance in this Enclave. Indeed the prosperity of this area is tied to its ability to keep terrorism out. To join this area one must be friends with Israel, one must accept the need for the very invasive surveillance needed to keep terrorism out of this area. Thus careful surveillance of this area will be easier than the rest of Gaza since it is done with the blessing and active support of its members. Importantly I want to put ultimate responsibility on this enclave for ensuring it is terrorism free. This makes the surveillance more an action impose from within rather than action taken from outside.

It would be at Israel's discretion how the sharing of this security verification occurred. But no matter what, it would be entirely different given a whole population swore an oath for proactive support, and openly acknowledged they were trading need to support Israel's security for their own personal prosperity. If you are not ready to make that trade don't swear the oath. And if you don't follow along, you get kicked out.

You may ask, so what is in it for the Palestinian? Why would any join such an invasive Enclave?? One word: Prosperity. The west and Israel both need to reward those few willing to sign up for Israel's security. We reward proof in action, with JOBS! Initially as this community is tiny, the costs to support it are also tiny. As the community grows the cost of supporting its economy will also grow, but the benefits in reduced security will also grow. And I think the ability for businesses to operate in this region could be greatly enhanced. Part of the prosperity of this area could come from its ability to be more open since it is so heavily and collaboratively scrutinized. Presently Israel must restrict things a simple a concrete into Gaza as they are actively used for attack. Since this community is so much better monitored (by Israel in tight cooperation with Enclave authorities) it is more possible to allow business operations knowing that monitoring is so much tighter.

You may say that no Palestinians will sign up. Perhaps few will initially. But that is fine. This still provides Israel a tiny Enclave where it can prove just how friendly it could be to Palestinians if only Israel's security was assured. And demonstrating this for the west would raise Israel's standing a lot. Israel could point to this Enclave and say: "see, if our security is assured, then we can be quite friendly indeed."

And I think this would be very instructive for Palestinian's too. You tell me as a Westerner I cannot really understand Israeli context---and you may well be right about that. Still I would say it might also be hard for you to wrap your head around the Palestinian mind who explains away Israel's prior offers of peace as not "real". Such a Palestinian has concluded that Israel can never be a friend to Palestinian people. This enclave---invasively monitored---would be proof that Palestinians could prosper as friends of Israel, more would come.

This enclave is not proof that Israel will ever relinquish security control over Gaza. Instead it is proof that Gazan's could have a prosperous life if they were friends with Israel---at the price of having invasive monitoring. That is probably a new thought for many Palestinians, who have bought into the propaganda that Israel intrinsically hates them and hopes to keep them down no matter what.

Whatever this idea is, it is quite different than the Oslo accords. Your thoughts?

### 2023-11-04  published on medium

Presently we are in deadlock: In their hearts Israelis know that some Palestinians want to wipe Israel out and reclaim all it land as soon as they are able. They see preventing Hamas from freedoms that would allow it to grow economically and militarily as an existential necessity. Palestinians in their heart know they are prisoners on their own land and their children’s children may well also die as prisoners on that same land. Without any hope in sight many see crazy drastic action as the only reasonable response.

Here is the nub of the problem: Even if Israel showered benefit and wealth upon Gaza there would still be 1% that would use any new found freedoms or wealth to blow Israel up! There is too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much honest feelings of having lands stolen. And no one can force a Palestinian to not believe their lands were stolen—everyone has a right to believe what they believe (even if YOU are certain that THEY are wrong).

My solution is to give Palestinians a choice: Stay where they are today, or move into a separated “Pro-Israel” enclave within their territory. Families that voluntarily join this enclave must commit to having NO MEANS to attack Israel and swear an oath to personally do their part to create a society that diligently ensures that no one else in their enclave harbors such means or intentions. Its not moral or workable to force such a dramatic commitment upon a person — this must be a voluntary choice. This group would not be monitored from without, rather it would monitored itself from within. It voluntarily arranges many types of self monitoring to ensure that shady stuff is not happening within its midst.

The international community and Israel would gladly partner with such an enclave, indeed most everyone would support such a group. Fostering peace would be a simple a fostering jobs within this enclave. As families realized their jobs were only as secure as their ability to keep their enclave free from Israel-attackers, they would become VERY motivated to keep such folks out!

There is too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much honest feeling of having lands stolen.  And no one can tell a Palestinian youth that their lands were not stolen, when they feel in their hearts that is was stolen---everyone has a right to believe what they believe (even if YOU are certain that THEY are wrong).

My solution is to give Palestinians a choice:  Stay where they are today, or move into a separated "Pro-Israel" enclave within their territory.  Families that voluntarily join this enclave must commit to having NO MEANS to attack Israel and swear an oath to personally do their part to create a society that diligently ensures that no one else in their enclave harbors such means or intentions.

Perhaps over time the enclave could evolve into a protectorate of Israel.  A self-governing country that had all freedoms of other countries except its defense was handled by Israel.  In the distant future, after decades of little aggression towards Israel, I suspect the international community and some in Israel would pressure Israel to fully release its grip and allow it to be an independent state.  This would not be such a consequential day, since the freedoms that really matter to the average Palestinian all came much earlier.  The price of self-policing seems a price worth paying.

Some might counter that its not fair that Palestinians should be required to swear an oath to protect Israel and to suffer the self monitoring needed to ensure compliance.

Over even longer time perhaps this group could develop better feeling towards Israel as their plight improves and Israel's boot is not so firmly on their neck.

### 2023-10-18  THREE STATE SOLUTION


What about a THREE state solution?

Imagine if Palestinians were given the option of moving to a separated part of their territory where ALL residence had also signed up to a commitment of having NO MEANS to attack Israel, and a commitment to self-police that no other residences in this area had such means.  Some voluntarily choose to live in this area, in return for access to externally supplied jobs and safety from attack from Israel.

Would Palestinians swear an oath join this area?  Could they successfully self-police others in the area so it generally did not pose a threat to Israel?

If such a region could be created, it seems it would be in Israel's interest that the population of this separated region would grow. And over time if this area was free from Israeli attacks and has jobs and freedoms, why wouldn't more Palestinians join it over time? Is this an incremental way out?

Thoughts?
### 2023-10-15  Both Isralies and Palestinians are justified in their hearts.  Thinking out loud: I propose a THREE state solution.

How can both sides be justified!?  Unlike logic, one side having a strong justification for action does not preclude the other side from also having a compelling justification for action.  At the end of this article I provide an argument many find compelling that concludes that no matter how Israel frees the Palestinians it greatly increases risk of large jew fatalities.  On the other side provide an argument that Palestinians have no hope and no way, thus precipitating rage and violence no matter its expected futility.

So what is the problem in using a two-state solution to solve this?  Some Palestinians fervently believe they should fight until Israel is gone.  Any gains made would embolden more aggressive future moves.  They really would not be satisfied until they had somehow won it all.  Likely it is only a small faction and a much larger group just wants to live a reasonable life.  But even among those who do not adhere to this thinking many still have very significant sympathies with that thinking.  Building a two state solution on this is fraught as long as part of its populace would use new found freedoms (and monies from Iran) to strike at Israel. Further, a two state solution is trying to force a people into a new opinion on a core belief---this just never works.  Some believe Israel should not exist, we must accept this is true, we cannot force a change here, we can only to provide them with a better alternative and see if over the decades they change their own mind...

Thinking out loud, I propose a THREE region solution: 
The first region is the state of Israel, the second is the occupied territories, and the third region is a proto-state carved out of the occupied territories.

Here are the core tenants of this proto-state:
- To be a citizen of this proto-state you must accept and support:
	- The idea that non-violent protests/actions are superior to violent one and will yield better results with Israel.
	- Complete and total condemn all violent actions for political ends in all cases.  (even if Israel were to act heinously)
	  ==> Notice: such a person need not accept Israeli action, they simply believe the response that will yield best results are non-violent (but potentially dramatic) ones.
	- this proto-state will actively precludes itself and its own citizens from having any means to harm Israel.
	- this proto-state will actively support Israel's abitlity to verify lack its lack of military abilities.

Those who join this proto-state need not believe that Israel is correct or justified.  They, like Gandi before them, believe having an iron-hard will, combined with a strict and total renouncement of violence will move mountains that violence itself could not move -- it will lead to a more prosperous state for its children to live in.

This is a very personal belief, it could be wrong, and it cannot be forced upon a person.  Thus membership in this proto-state would also be voluntary, each family can freely choose to live in the proto-state or outside of it.  Now it is up to Israel and the west to make living inside this proto-state preferable to living outside of it.

Of course Israel can do this by making life outside such a state a living hell, and in many ways they already DO make living in Gaza a kind of state wide prison.  Still it does not make sense to push people too hard to join the proto-state, this will just overwhelm that state with many people who do not freely accept its peaceful tenants.  My thinking for this proto-state is that it should grow slowly filled with people who are strongly committed to non-violence as a means of change.

My thinking is that such a committed non-violent group will have a larger voice on the international stage than Palestinians have today.  Their voice would be a purer one, one that could be accepted without reservation by nearly all groups.  Over time, I suspect they would win larger concessions from Israel than other Palestinians could win by other means.  They might even win concessions that apply to ALL occupied territories not just for their proto-state.  I think they could win more international investment as well.  In trade they gave up their right and their ability to physically defend themselves from Israel.  

Time would tell if their path would be the more prosperous one.  But if they managed to keep extremists out of their ranks year after year it seems hard for Israel to justify many restrictions upon them.  Indeed why would Israel care to impose restrictions upon them?  



.  Thus families opt to join this 


This proto-state is predicated on the belief that a population dedicated to the safety of Israel as a core part of its condition for existence will be a far superior partner for Israel that one who had not.  And 


The first two regions are Israel
