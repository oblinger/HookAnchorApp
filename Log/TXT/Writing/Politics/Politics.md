### 2024-11-11  short

No it does not! It shows we are not listening!!! They worry:

-- MIGRANTS: Millions of migrants will take jobs and burden our services.

-- TRANS: Bathrooms will not be safe, sports will not be fair, and taxes will be misspent on gender affirming care.

-- CANDIDATES: Hillary and Biden were not broadly popular/trusted candidates by the middle, we can pick ones that are.

-- SPEECH: Speech will not be free if the gov pressure twitter on what does and does not count as hate or mis-information.

explaining to me how these concerns are not valid misses the point. Middle American defines what is valid, and those leaders who find the best compromises lead.

WE DID NOT HEED WE DO NOT LEAD.

~~

Here is my list in order of importance:

-- illegal immigration. (this ties to economy)

-- trans issues: bathroom safety. sports fairness. tax dollar on surgery.

-- Partisan attacks on Trump and on free speech

-- Kamala is quite liberal and a less know quantity

### 2024-11-11  Democrats Wake Up! 2


America does not deserve the consequences they are about to receive from this election.  Sure there are ardent Trump supporters that love everything he represents, but much of America simply tolerates him because IN THERE EYES he is better than Dem incompetence on key issues.

A successful leader must find the compromises that allow most constituents to be mostly satisfied.  If you don't represent the interests of your constituents (as judge BY your constituents) then you don't deserve and wont to lead them.  I explain here where I think Dems lost the right to lead.

As you read these, don't explain in your mind how these claims are wrong, that does not matter!  It only matter that they ARE widely believed and the Dems did little to address them.



THE ECONOMY
American's don't feel they or the economy are doing well, so leaders that actively make this worse are simply disqualified as a viable leaders, no matter what else they do.

IMMIGRATION
Most don't buy arguments that huge numbers of migrants entering our country won't take limited jobs from citizens, and they don't believe these millions won't cost more services than their low wage taxes pay for.  Thus when they see a bus-load of illegally entering migrants being openly released onto our streets BY OUR GOV makes their blood BOIL!!!   Bus loads after bus loads of society-ending mountains of Democratic failure on TV EACH WEEK for four years.  This perceived and actual failure ALONE is enough to entirely disqualify Democrats in the mind of many.

FRACKING
Most citizens view climate and environment as important but not existential.  They want compromises that protect the economy, so Fracking that replaces coal with natural gas is a trade they overwhelmingly want.  In general they want to hear hard talk about how costs are being contained, not just how many smelt are saved.


TRANS ISSUES
The middle want a society that is fair, safe and prosperous.
-- They don't believe it is FAIR for biological males to compete with bio females
-- They don't think it is SAFE to force bio females to go to the bathroom with biological males.
-- They don't think it is right to use tax money to pay for "gender affirming care."
-- They don't like focus on DEI, and woke pronouns etc.  They believe Republican claims that federal forcing of DEI has caused ineffective hires, and woke concerns prove that leaders don't have their eye on what is important (the economy).

Dems need to just shut up about these "third rail" issues, say they are an issue for the states, and let society progress as it naturally IS progressing.  In a democracy, one group using legislation to FORCE its values on to another large group SHOULD and WILL loose its power.


PARTISAN TRUMP ATTACKS:  Legal attacks on Trump have clearly HELPED him!!  But Why?!  Because they are (correctly) seen as a partisan.  If we cannot bring a case which a NEUTRAL or conservative federal judge will prosecute, then we should bring no case as all.  They helped Trump, and they weaken our Democracy as they normalize the use of partisan judges to bring political cases.  (Notice Biden feloniously mis-handled classified documents....   Should we now be throwing him into jail?  a partisan judge might!)


FREE SPEECH
A virologist was banned on twitter for claiming the Corona came from a Wuhan lab.  One politician was banned from twitter for saying "A man cannot give birth" because he was transphobic.  News about hunter-biden's laptop was blocked as mis-information, yet turned out to be true.  We later find that Biden's gov pressured Twitter and others to censure.  THE MIDDLE BELIEVES IN FREE SPEECH, and does not trust liberals to be in charge of what is an is not "mis-information" or "hate speech."



BIDEN'S INFIRMITY
The Dem's inner circle demand one of their own lead the white house, and are willing to risk the presidency to ensure this.  Hillary was KNOWN to be very unpopular, Biden in both terms was KNOWN to be frail in ways that bothered the middle.  We were simply told, "yeah, but its better than the other guys!"

The Democrats lost the 2016 election, Trump did not win it, the same in 2024.
Biden did win in 2020, but it was entirely a "not that other guy" vote!!

Wow Democratic party, is this the best we can do?  You Do deserve to loose BADLY.
But of course America does not deserve what is about to happen to it.  Very sad.



(Of course America does not deserve what it about to happen, but it is entirely the Dems fault)


### 2024-11-07  Democrats Wake Up!

DEMOCRATS WAKE UP!  This loss is not about the "orange man."   The middle does not trust him either, its just that they trust you EVEN LESS!  Look to thyself for answers!

Here are the "lightning rod issues" that I think cost the election:

ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, sanctuary cities, blocking ICE, using tax dollars for non citizens in any way, when they feel they are hurting.

TRANS ISSUES:  Bathroom safety.  Fairness in sports.  Gender surgery.  Unease about increased cultural prominence.

PARTISAN TRUMP ATTACKS:  Legal attacks on Trump have HELPED him, since they are is seen as a partisan witch hunt, since they ARE so partisan.

DEI / WOKE PRONOUNS, ETC:  Some don't like this stuff, but most just view it as evidence of Dems not having eye on the ball (the economy) and instead screwing around with stuff that doesn't matter.

ECONOMY:  Trump has a simple story: illegals, trade, and china.  Dems needed a incumbent to tell a simply story about how they are going to fix the economy...  not a VP saying:  "I can't thinking of anything I would change!"

sure we can talk about how misguided those concerns are from the sidelines, or we can hold our nose and compromise to address the concerns.

We have exactly two choices:
(1) Move our party decisively away from these lightning rod issues, or 
(2) Kvetch from the sidelines about how badly the other guys are running things.



KEY MINDSET DIFFERENCES:    
**ABUNDANCE VS. SCARCITY**.  Liberals come from an abundance mind set, believing one can give more to those in need w/o drastic loss for the rest.  Conservatives come from a zero-sum, scarcity mind set.  Citizens are barely hanging on, and many of our problems stem from too much "free loading" already in the system.
**LAWLESS "RABBLE" VS POWER PLAYS.**  Liberals believe society's ills stem from the actions of the powerful over the weak.  Conservatives believe society's ills stem from lawless actions of the "rabble" against productive society.
**HUMAN NATURE.**  Liberals believe when humans are bad its mostly from their environment.  Conservatives its mostly the nature of the bad person.  Thus liberals favors strong support while conservatives favor strong law enforcement.


ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
This is of proportions far far far far far larger an any liberal can comprehend.  New York times did a great piece on "line cutting", explaining the conservative's rage when Democrats "let" or "assist" non-citizen's to access citizen benefits (roads, schools, medical, etc.).  This is a triple whammy:
- LOSS: According to a zero-sum mindset every dollar spent is a dollar NOT available to a legitimate citizen.
- FAIRNESS:  They say:  Hey you wanna give charity, fine.  out of YOUR pocket! get out of mine!  you have no right to squander my birth right away to a never ending sea of non-citizens.
- RULE OF LAW: They might not be happy with LEGAL immigration of many poor from a scarcity mindset, but they go BALLISTIC when it is ILLEGAL immigration, and we are not strenuously trying to enforce rule of law.

Many persuadable middle of the road blue collar Americans (of all genders and races) are outraged by "sanctuary cities".  The idea that Democrats would willing ASSIST in the committing of a crime that is hurting them personally and economically is by itself fully disqualifying by itself.  It is proof they Dems to care about them, and don't represent them.

My wife is a legal immigrant, and she has bad feelings that others would get in via illegal means.  Indeed FOURTY-ONE percent of hispanics voted for Trump.   FORTY-FREAKING PERCENT!!!  Do you think they like Trump calling them rapists?  Or that they are racist against hispanics themselves??  No, but they do believe in republican-fairness, in scarcity-based zero-sum benefits, and are on the edge of making it, so they vote Trump.
And if this can push a Mexican to vote for Trump, how much more for the rest of America.


So what could Dems do:
-- First don't call them "undocumented" immigrants, call them "illegal" immigrants.  Softening the language does not change facts on the ground, but it does indicate a stance.  This kind of immigration is not an existential issue to solve, it is not a catastrophically bad crime, it is more like J-walking, technically a crime, but not one of massive import.  They dramatically don't feel that way and anyone who does feel that way is disqualified from leading.
-- Dump "sanctuary cities" from mainstream Dem thinking, and fully support the ICE's role of deporting undocumented migrants.  Either we gain support across the nation to pass laws to legally increase immigration or we just don't do it.  Using these gorilla tactics helps us to win the battle, but then loose the war.  They are a modest bandaid, but are fully disqualifying for many.
-- Keep Trump's "remain in Mexico" policy.  Just like Trump does with Obamacare we can decry the policy but not repeal it.  We could even inject many millions of dollars to make the plight of those waiting in Mexico better.  Its not "Republican-fair" that illegals that will never get legal status access the country for years, and worse yet may well use this as a way to stay forever.  Week after week seeing videos of immigration catching illegals and then just turning them out into the streets of America based on Dem policies single handedly turned many against the party right there.


Sure none of this not "Democrat-fair."  I am proposing we find other methods to support the desperate immigrants that might spend years more in Mexico before coming in.  This issue more than any other sank our chances.


TRANS ISSUES
We really hurt our electability over what we see as "obvious" choices on a collection of issues:  Bathroom safety.  Fairness in sports.  "Woke" pronoun usage.  Trans prominence within culture.

Conservative 

Personally I think your suspicious are also correct, many conservatives are "conservative."  They just don't like/approve of trans lifestyles and actions.  You can fret how backwards they are, but it you hope to represent them you must accommodate this.


.  I don't think they are yet and themselves over what we see as an "obvious" but smaller

Sure the USA gains many large benefits from immigration.



that propelled trump both times and brexit too as in a zero-sum mindset every dollar spend is dollar 



A valid response to this list is to say.  No that is too far.  I would rather loose power than do those things, but an invalid response is to explain how this thinking is "wrong" it does not matter that you think is right or wrong, it matter what that voter thinks is right or wrong.  The only way we get to retain power, AND do what we want



please quit looking at the charlatan that just trounced you, look at your self that is where the problem lies.

I live in SanFran but am from KY.  News flash: we Dems DON'T represent the nation.  Its not that Trump is loved, it is that the Dems are hated/not trusted.

I am not arguing the list below are valid, but I AM arguing they are WIDELY believed and they cost the election.  For me, I would have been happy with a Dem party that gave dramatic ground on these issues, in order to have Harris in office right now.  Perhaps you don't agree and you think we need to remain "pure" (and out of power), but that is not my thought.


DEMOCRATS PLEASE PLEASE WAKE UP!

I reject Trump, yet am from a very Red state and i can tell you we Democrats are VERY out of touch with whats most important to much of America.  We can remain pure, mostly out of power, and console ourselves it is all the fault of those "evil" populists.  Or we can dramatically compromise on a tiny set of "lightening rod" issues and then, while in power, do great good on many others.

Contrary to your thinking, a great many Trump voters are really turned off by many same things that turn you off about him, but they are turned off even more by tone-deaf or "unfair" Democrat policies.  (unfair as they define fairness, not as you define it!)


Let me outline choices that I think would have dramatically flipped this election.
You will hate them all.  But ask yourself, was it really worth loosing to Trump?  I assure you, as I talk with Trumpers, these ARE the issues that sank our battleship, they are not hiding their feelings about these things if we just listen!

https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/12/why-liberal-satire-and-conservative-outrage-are-both-responses-to-mainstream-media-but-with-very-different-powers/

If outrage is a well-trained attack dog that operates on command, satire is a raccoon — hard to domesticate and capable of turning on anyone at any time.

Does satire have a liberal bias? Sure. Satire has a liberal psychological bias. But the only person who can successfully harness the power of satire is the satirist. Not political strategists. Not a political party. Not a presidential candidate. Outrage is the tool of conservative elites. But ironic satire is the tool of the liberal satirist alone.

### 2024-06-26  Fixing Banking

Ellen,

There is a clear moral hazard in having banks insured, and to me it is clear that we want Bank INVESTORS to be thinking hard about a banks solvency, but not its DEPOSITORS. Society is better off if deposits are just guaranteed.

The federal gov is the only LLR that can really cover any future contingency, but using them also exposes the US taxpayer to abuse. What about the following:

(1) When a bank goes into default, a US gov LRR fund steps in to provide liquidity. That liquidity is automatically paid back with a 30% per year interest or something pretty onerous. Further the gov LRR is paid BEFORE any other previous investors are paid back. Thus in most cases these liquidity crunches will be a net win for the US gov. (we want to set that rate high enough that on average in the long run this fund runs a solid profit.)

(2) Second we require banks to have "collateral investors" in the bank, for example the shareholders of a business might chose to collateralize 20% of their business in return for a bank dividend each day that the bank does not go bankrupt. If the bank does go bankrupt then a fraction of the collateral is transferred to the LRR fund to cover part of the liquidity needed. We probably need the bank to have collateral covering 40-50% of their deposits.

(3) Third the US gov uses the free market rate on this collateral in order to decide how much to charge a bank for being its LRR. The more expensive that collateral is, the higher the required gov insurance is. A bank that starts to look unhealthy will probably find it is better to just sell itself (at a discount to its investors) to a healthier bank early on, since its costs are creeping upward.

NOW we could have a "free" market that was safe. Depositors never get screwed, the gov LRR almost never gets screwed. And savvy investors that know how to stay away from toxic banks can make a tidy profit.

Bank runs would not really exist, since the US gov is promising to pay depositors dollar for dollar with no limit. if a bank is just hit a short term pinch, they would need to pay 30% interest, but mostly their collateral providers would not get hit, since the LRR need not keep possession of those assets if the bank can eventually dig its way out and pay back the 30% interest. Only when the long term value of its loans are permanently degraded then investor collateral end up loosing money.

Seems like this system places all the risks and all the rewards up all on top of the investors in the banks... thus removing the moral hazard. and removing the hazard for the economy at large.

Why does this not work from all angles?? (well except from the angle of the investor wanting to leverage that moral hazard)docs

### 2024-05-19  UBI Cant Work - Rebuttal

Great discussion, but your argument is flawed as it adjust one variable (percent unemployed) without adjusting other variables, e.g. cost of things.

When looking at drug prices in poor vs. rich countries we often see complete disconnect in pricing.  A manufacturer never wants to price their goods beyond what can be afforded.  As long as they can afford the raw ingredients needed, they will just keep lowering the price until it can be afforded.  If AI drives the cost (measured in hours of human labor to near zero) it will also drive the ingredient costs down and raw material costs will drop too since there will not be buyers at higher prices.

Consider the per-capita income in the poorest nations of Africa are presently less than 1/100th or 1/1000th the per-capita income of the riches enclaves.  Yet they still have money to buy clothing.  How can they afford them?  The price is lowered until they can.

In an AI-driven world the price of AI-made good will drop until they can be afforded.

Still its not all honey and roses!  AI-companies will accumulate colossal and ever increasing wealth.  Via unpleasant or down right violent means this will have to be reshaped so they get rich, but not infinitely rich relative to the population.  The USA managed this without bloodshed in the beginning of the 19th century when robber barrons threatened to fully control pricing and labor salaries... perhaps we can do it again?

From a purely economic point of view there are no issues having money to pay for material goods in a world where such goods are simply produced via AI-driven processes... Now, getting a redistribution system in place to make that happen.  Yeah that will involve "excitement" of one kind or another.


### n2021-00-00 - ARE YOU INFORMED OR ARE YOU MANAGED?


I have a thought I have been chewing on thought for a bit.   See what you think...


There are two kinds of information sources:
— those that primarily seek to inform you, and
— those that primarily seek to convince you.


It is easy to tell the difference between these two:
— A source intent on informing you will present information in ways that highlight both support and opposition to any simple overarching world view (e.g.  small government is better, left is better, right is better, pro-business pro-union, etc.)
— Imagine a weather channel that is always highlighting the fact that is it not snowing in Dallas.  This might be true, but it's not news.  News is something that goes against what is expected… it is “new”-s
— So any outlet that that frames every story as always supporting or always opposing…… ANYTHING.  Is not primarily a source of news, it is a source of propaganda.  It might be factually accurate propaganda, or not factual, but either way, the aim is clear — it primarily aims to persuade.


I guess there is another possibility.  Perhaps where is a world view so perfect and so complete, it is such a perfect explanation of the world, there are no exceptions or special cases to report on.  Of the hundreds of millions of human interactions each day there simply IS no contrary information worth reporting.  Yeah, and I have the hot tip on how to buy in on this bridge being built...


So here is my maxim:

If you don’t have info sources you trust and listen to which regularly highlight examples that challenge or contradict your core beliefs, you are not informed … you are managed.  

Now of course not everyone really wants to be informed and challenged, I get that.  
Either way, it is just good to know where you stand.




What ya think?

### n2022-07-22  - Religious tolerance

This seems an issue of legitimate disagreement in this country.
Some honestly see same-sex couples as a natural and healthy thing.
Others see it as unhealthy and evil. Which group on earth is qualified to determine who is right?
An honest question: Shouldn't we be working to have Christian schools that don't discriminate, and others that do? It seems wrong to me, for the government to force the opinion that same sex IS moral. By forcing all religious schools to adopt a specific practice we are effectively having the government take a moral stance here.
NOTE: it seems very reasonable that the government ensure that there are Christian schools available that are same-sex affirming. after all 53% of the population is in favor of this, so it would be wrong to have a coalition of Christian churches block other churches. But it seems just as wrong to have a government lead coalition.
This note is not intended to be confrontational. I am honestly questioning this.

### t2019-00-00 - Ryan (Baltimore school teacher)

Ryan,
Thanks for taking the time to respond! If you don't mind indulging me further, I would love to get your critical assessment a bit further. It is remotely possible that some action might even come from this thinking…
My aim is to NOT spend (much) more money per student, yet partially address this issue. The not spending more money part is the hard part of course, but if it is solvable, then it has a greater chance to be implemented.
The idea is to have:
(1) a SINGLE bootcamp school for an entire city the size of Baltimore. So even though the cost per student per day is much higher than a traditional school, since we only have ONE, the city-wide cost per student is negligible.
(2) to make this happen, students have to actively and dramatically NOT want to go to this school, so even for a difficult student, they actively choose to avoid being sent there. (If they don't mind going to the school, then we run out of room at our expensive school.)
(3) the central (proposed) benefit is that as a teacher you can require a basic level of cooperation and if they can be placed in detention at your school. If they don't comply you can escalate at any hour of any day to their immediate transfer to this school, just for the night, or for a week.


As I see it, the problem with suspension and detention is that they are

### n2019-00-00 - CONSEQUENCES in the classroom
CONSEQUENCES.
It seems to me that in our effort to have "no child left behind" we have gone astray. But I wonder your thoughts on the matter, you might not agree.
We correctly note that when we suspend a student, prison other legal actions, chances are higher that they will fail in life. From this we conclude that we should minimize these corrective actions when we can.
My theory is that this is not a good path. Seems to me that we all need consequences tied to actions as a way of shaping behavior. And failing to have consequences early on, allow behaviors to become progressively worse.
That said, it seems we should have (1) certain, (2) compelling, but (3) temporary consequences, so one can learn. It also seems that our lack of rigorous enforcement of consequences on a few, has significant impact on many within those same classrooms.
So as I imagine it, we would have rigorously enforced, quick response, quick relief consequences.
But you are living it, in a Baltimore public school, and I am not. Tell me what you think:
We both know suspension damages education, so it is best avoided. What if instead of this we had a "bootcamp" school. The cost per student per day is probably 4x the cost for a normal class. The students have therapists on staff, and strong physical controls with pretty limited interaction with other students. No TV, no 2-way Internet. Significant physical chores each day, as well as their daily lessons captured via smartphone from their classroom.
My idea is that this place would be LESS FUN than most any other life choices, and so it would be avoided at all costs. Any student that repeatedly ended up in this spot, likely has strong enough emotional problems, that they inadvertently end up there. So those students need specialized theraputic help.
In my imagination, have such a "low-damage, quick fix" at your fingertips would be transformative in your classroom. You would just say: ``billy, sit down now and be quiet, or you will spend 1/2 hour after class on extra homework.'' …. he knows from experience if he does not stay after for his extra homework, he will spend a week in bootcamp. He knows this with CERTAINTY, that this will be his consequence. Its just 1/2 hour, but if he does not do his 1/2, then his WHOLE NEXT WEEK will be no fun at all.
How many times do you think he will need to learn this lesson? Many others will learn of this CONSEQUENCE by just watching what happened to Billy.


So I know the purpose of your post was very much a heart felt quandry about very real choices you are forced to make. Sorry for high-jacking your post to ask this question. But you are the right one to ask.
Would it work? Would it be good? Would it transform your classrooms?
Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

https://medium.com/p/fab3a09409ad/responses/show

My Context: not quite a believer in God, nor a non-believer either.


Ella, as usual your piece is well written, and conveys the Anthropomorphic concept well. As I consider the assertion in the text: ``that these coincidences *force* scientist toward the multiverse model'' it occurs to me:
Science can never really provide insight onto the question of the divine.
Science has an unshakable bias towards naturalist explanations - science itself has a strong selection bias. Thus its successes in finding naturalist explanations, and its failure to find evidence for anything else merely reflects the selection bias of science itself - this outcome is not necessarily a reflection on reality.
That said, I am not trying to bend this into some kind of God proof. What it is, is dramatic proof of the unshakability of the scientific bias (which of course has empirically served humanity quite well.)

### n2019-00-00 - THE TWO CHOICES (politics)

FELLOW DEMOCRATS, WAKE THE EFF UP !


Mathematics dictates that each party has exactly two choices:

(1) Craft a message that resonates with a winning majority of electorial seats.

(2) Whine and moan from the sidelines while others lead.



In 2016 the Democrats chose option #2 and Trump chose #1 -- that is not my opinion that is historical fact.  

As we head further left we dig deeper into #2 -- folks that's not my opinion -- that is simple math.

       *WAKE*  *THE*   *EFF*   *UP* !!!   



So what should we do?
1. Focus!  Only talk about issues that appeal broadly to all Americans.



### n201--00-00  The Future #2 - no jobs

I find pieces like this quite frustrating. You assert: we don't have to chase "talent," we can have pay parity... and profits won't suffer. I promise!

I agree with your worries, but pretending that dynamics which CAUSE these problems are not there is pointless hand wringing. Like basecamp we hire rarified talent, and treat them well -- you have to if you are going to keep them!

But here is the reality check for you: the jobs (like basecamp) where one person's output will impact 1M+ other people are mathematically going to be rare. And these markets are winner(s) take most all. This is the nature of knowledge work. And with automation/robotics/AI the remaining physical work will continue to have less and less monetary value.

Knowledge work is an inherently unstable business. It reinvents itself at an astounding speed. Winners get more profit then grow faster, and win more. They grow to permanently dominate their area, until it is disrupted. The main areas for growth are new ones where no one has yet established dominance... and the race to gain that dominance in those areas is FIERCE. Only the luckiest, talent-est, hardest driving have a shot at that dominance, the rest will dwindle. This is the math of reality my friend, as much as you feel it morally should be different, it is not.

For me the more troubling trend is the reality that we have physical work which is loosing value, and knowledge work is tending towards greater concentration. (e.g. 1 human impacts more and more others). Thus the percentage of the population that are strong financial contributors drops.

Capitalism was just not built for this situation, and humans were not built to have no job.

But back to your article.  It is frustrating because it purports to aim at a solution and has not even identified the problem correctly (in my opinion).

### n201--00-00  The Future

The core problem that is killing / will kill the present economic system:

TALENT.  

MULTIPLIERS.  I define a multiplier as a person whose output noticeably benefits 1M+ other people in a way that they are willing to pay for over the course of a year.  For example a well known, or strong football player might affect their team to a degree to drive game sales for 1M+ people within a given year.

In the past multipliers were rare, and the fraction of the GDP paid to mulipliers was tiny, but several trends (aggregation, automationm, robotics and AI) are driving the to a point where multipliers will dominate and ultimately destroy the current economic system.

This analysis is a bit simplistic, but it gets to the root of the current shift:
Automation and aggregation are increasing the multiplication of the people remaining within certain industries.  At the turn of the last century a single farmer could only grow the food for several, now it is several hundred thousands, and the trend only accelerates.  Distribution and manufacturing are on similar trajectories.  The result is fewer people needed and outputs increased.

The second trend AI and Robotics replaces human labor with capital -- the capital needed to pay for the AI and robotics.  This also reduces the number of non-multiplier jobs available.  

The only counter trend to this is a craftsman or service trend where a premium is paid specifically for human labor itself.  Either because the human labor is in some way still superior to the automated alternative, or it is just the luxury of having another human wait upon you.

But the fraction of the GDP paid to the non-multiplier crowd will drop without limit as automation replaces humans as the most effective solution for most tasks.

This will yield a three tiered society: multipliers, servers/craftsman, and unemployables.

Now how do we run such a society?  The multipliers will easily make 100x more than servers do, and the unemployed make nothing?  The present system would leave one group dead, the next group desolate earning a few percent of the GDP, and the top group making all the money.
