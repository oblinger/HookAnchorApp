Capital in service of people, NOT people in service of capital.

One hopes for a societal mechanism that best leverages capital (resources) in service of the poplation.

Increasingly we see our present societal mechanism leverages the population in service of capital.

To see that we are living in the latter dystopian case, one only needs to consider any case where profits and population well being are at odds and then consider which side wins.  The mechanism is designed to ensure that capital wins even to the point of literally killing the populous.  Of course in such extreme cases laws will be passed to blunt the market's abilty to trade human well being for profit, but the fact that laws need to be past in order to stop this distopic outcome is evidence of who the markets really serve:  when there is a conflict markets serve the needs of capital at the expense of the people rather than the needs of the people at the expense of capital.



se side the capital markets are really on:  it on capital's side.

- what was the original idea for capital markets

- the many good things we get from capital markets

- where it all went wrong

- a new mechanims

A value market seeks to maximize the value obtained thru market participation, where value obtained as assessed by the participants themselves.

_
## === KEY IDEAS ===
### --- DRIVERS ---
- WIN/GROW - Entire system must successfully compete within the capitalist system.
- 

_
### --- AGGLOMERATION ---

COHORT TAXONOMIES
- PARTICIPANT GROUPS - Build dendogram of all participants, grouping them demographically based on many attributes in order to maximize similarity of behavior within the market.
- BAYSIAN PRIORS - Statistics gathered at multiple levels provide information that trades off size of group / amount of data with the specificity of the group.
- COHORT DAGS - Several different cohort trees are used to assess value transfer
	- PARTICIPANT DEMOGRAPHIC DAGS
	- BUSINESS TYPE DEMOGRAPHIC DAGS




ADOPTION TRAJECTORY
- SIGNUP - Participants signup for various services as introduced thru other services.
- AWARENESS - Assessment if participant because aware of a new service adopted because of the network.
- INFLUENCER - Assessment of which influencer drove a signup
- ALTERNATIVE ADOPTION - Assessment of how many signups would have happened anyway 



~-~~-~-~


- ADOPTION - Each part can potentially drive adoption for all of its counter parts.  The lifetime value of these adoptions is part of the value it brings to its counter parts.
	- ONBOARDING - 
	- INCREMENTAL ADOPTION - 

- EXTERNALITIES - Each part in aggregate may engender positive or negative externalities, these are collectively assessed and considered as part its value.

- PARTICIPATION VALUE - 
	- SALES 
	- PROJECTED SALES
	- 

~-~~-~~

How do taxonomies work?

- Find n most predictive features and build statistical models based on each feature alone.
- Consider feature combinations and measure size and strength of MISMATCH to prediction built from combining individual features.

_
### --- BIG MONEY ---

CAPITALISM DYNAMICS --

- BIG MONEY AGENDA -- Big money seeks opportunities for sustained ROI in excess of the market average.
- SUSTAINABLE DIFFERENTIATION -- Must arrange for some kind of sustained differential ability to operate.
	Otherwise other market participants will copy approach and drive returns towards the market average.
- NEED AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE
	- FIRST MOVER -- One approach is to dominate an opportunity having some network effect.
	- EASY OPPORTUNITIES ALL TAKEN
	- REMAINING ONES REQUIRE SOMETHING RARE
		- HUGE MONEY
		- PRIVELEDGED POSITION (which can usually be bought with big money)
- SMALL MONEY LOOSES -- Thus small money will often loose to big money.  If big money can arrange to block small money it will.


_
### --- HYPER SLICING / HYPER COMBINATING ---

Key to making the marketplace work is the idea of HyperSlicing

HYPER SLICING -- Reducing the size (as measured in hours/minutes, or seconds) of the smallest meaningful contribution of various kinds.

HYPER COMBINATING -- Increasing the range of contributions that can be meaningfully combined to increase usage value.

_
### --- INCREMENTAL VALUE ---

everyone gets paid incremental value of their contribution.

- everyone specifies relative contribution of all inputs to their work
- no-one specifies relative contribution of their work


AUTO CALCULATIONS
- Multi-Author Contribution Scoring -- how to split value when multiple contribute to single thing
	- NOT ZERO SUM -- No need to force payments to sum to some constant.
	- TOP WEIGHTED -- But lionshare of payments for those who consistently maintain thing
	- FRONT WEIGHTED -- A heathy (decaying) bonus paid for those that create and actively maintain an area
	- CONSENSUS WEIGHTED -- Modest bonus paid if one is accepted as the consensus maintainer???

_
### --- ORACULAR VALUE ---


- PROBLEM OF CHOICE -- In a marketplace that allows "a thousand flowers to bloom" one will not have one 'best' version of most anything, instead one will have a morass of competing snowflakes, each just a bit different than the others.  Selecting good choices from this space is HARD.
- EXPERTISE -- It will require significant expertise and coverage to support self or others in choosing
- BEING RIGHT -- Providing an answer among so many choices, providing the "right" answer is HARD, but is also where the value lies
- DIFFERENTIAL ADVICE ASSESSMENT -- Provide user with two different oracular selectors in succession and have them indicate a selection after each, then provide an assessment of the value obtained.
	- SIMPLICITY -- In understanding the options and making a choice
	- CONFIDENCE -- Confidence good choice is being made
	- COMPLETENESS -- Confidence that a best choice was among those considered
- DELTA VALUE -- Performs differential advice assessment on an incremental oracle by asking user's about the relative value of the two versions of the advice provided
- TEMPORAL FOLLOWUP -- Prompt user with a post usage updated assessment of the value of the oracular choice provided.

- SEARCHING -- 


INCREMENTAL ORACLE -- Instead of building a whole new oracle one can simply 'edit' another person's oracle to add value.

_
### --- MARKETPLACE SYMMETRY ---
Market place should "play well" with other marketplaces
- It should grow in size relative to non-value markets based on the participant value generated by the market.
- It should 'play well' with other markets, especially with other value markets
_
### --- RISING TIDES & COLLABORATION EFFICIENCIES makes THE BOGO BUCK SYSTEM WORK ---
- GREATEST WEAKNESS OF VALUE MARKETS -- is its the measure of value.  (this sounds really BAD, & it is a big challenge.)
	Because value markets strip control from contributors, and give stuff away, it removes the "buy" and "price" signals that conventional markets use to assess value. 
	In its place a host of indirect (bogo buck) measures are used to try to assess value obtained.

SEVERAL THINGS HELP MAKE THIS SYSTEM WORK DISPITE THE DIFFICULTY IN PRECISELY MEASURING VALUE:

- RISING TIDES RAISE ALL SHIPS
	Interlocking ownership in (1) the currency, (2) the investment fund, and (3) may parts of system help to ensure that participants are still sufficiently rewarded for value generating action even when the assessment measures fall short.

- COLLABORATION
	Present capital markets are so collosally maladapted to Knowlege based markets, even in cases where the value market dramatically misprices a contribution, it is likly still sufficiently valued as to make its contribution worthwhile even given option to contribute outside the value market into a market that does not have this same pricing errors.

_
## === CREDITED COMPONENT ===

A credited component is one whose contributions are tracked and relative "credit" is assigned to appropriate producers.

_
## === CREDIT ASSIGNMENT ===

Given all the ambitious and wide reaching goals of the marketplace, optimal assignment of credit to market place component is not possible.  Indeed it is not well defined, possibly it is not even possible provide a single consistent defintion, in any case at a practical level deriving optimal assignment of credit is completely unattainable.  

Fortunately large value can be obtained for all market participants even with very approximate credit assigment mechanisms.

The reality is that the world itself is quite a chaotic place.  Even in present capital markets individual must act with very ill-understood consequences.  This is sufficient to drive progress as long as individuals have SOME abilty to aim towards somewhat likely generation of value and compensation.  We will see the marketplace credit assignment does not add appreciably to this already large uncertaintny in


- VISIBLE COMMIT HISTORY -- A key way to ensure component credit is to develop the component with a visible commit history.  This simply means that a frequently updated publically viewable reposity is provided during the development of the component.  This allows for fairly accurate automated assessments of constribution authorship.
(It does not track idea authorship well since one can copy an idea piecemeal.  Still it does show how the parts of a component came to be.  It is pretty hard to fake the act of coding some component if one is authoring, testing, and evolving that compoent in a fine-grained visible way.)
- TRACABLE COMMIT HISTORY -- 
- ANTECEDENT LINKAGES -- Human annotated linkages indicating ideological or implementation contributions


_
## === FORKING ===

FORKING -- A marketplace fork occurs anytime a fork of some component in the marketplace is also accepted into the market place along side the original one.



note:  Any individual may fork any component anytime.  There is no restriction on this.  Placing that fork back into the marketplace fractures the marketplace leaving contributors unclear which fork they should be supporting.

FORK RATIONALE -- 

FRIENDLY FORK -- A friendly fork occurs with the existing an existing maintainer of the original component indicates approval of the new fork.  Typically the fork rationale and will be agree upon by both the original maintainer, and they see value to the overall marketplace by having the fork


~-~

SIMPLE FORK ACCOUNTING -- Do nothing special.  Allow voting with feet determine the value of each fork...  Assuming the forks really are duplicative, this will naturally drive contributors to focus on the dominant fork in a virtuous cycle that will over time leave the other fork with little support and thus little improvement.

~-~

ADVANCED FORK ACCOUNTING -- Simple fork accounting

### --- CONTRIBUTION ---
- Each contribution ties to some asset which accumulates in value over time.

FACTORS
- INCREMENTAL VALUE -- contribution value must be understood relative to the value of the contributions that it builds upon.
- DUPLICATIVE VALUE REDUCTIONS -- the more that a contribution duplicates prior contributions the less value it has
- DIVERSITY VALUE -- Different is good.  The more a contribution represents a new thought or approach the more value it has.
- SYNERGISTIC VALUE -- The way a contribution is provided can diminish overall value by confusing subsequent contributions.  acheving diverse contributions sometimes can only be done at the expense of simplicity, such complexity does not significantly reduce synergistic value, UNLESS one could have contributed in a more synergistic ways, but one did not.
- NEED/IMPORTANCE -- certain contributions are known apriori to be important areas.
- DRIVING -- certain contribtuions drive or expand overall market activity

		Value markets seek to maximize the transfer of value from contributor to consumer
		- They are decentralized and competitive like capital markets

### ### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ###

> > >> on contributor side -- a model of human thriving
> > >> on consumer side -- a freedom from exploitation ???


																**VALUE MARKETS**

		In this paper we describe "value markets" as an alternative to the prevelant capital markets of today.  This new kind of market is designed around a particular understanding of what is required for human thriving.  We argue that today's capital markets get some things very right for human thriving, but also get several things very wrong.  We aim to correct the latter. 

		Before diving into a description of this new kind of market, it is helpful for us to first present our understanding of human thriving and use this understanding to enumerate aspects of human action within society that are consistent-with and important-for human thriving.  These aspects become the guiding lights we utlize in constructing our alternate market mechansim.


		**HUMAN THRIVING**

		We humans are built to have a purpose -- to have one or more missions _we choose for ourselves_ which give meaning to our lives.  We _must_ have such a purpose; we will literally kill ourselves if we completely loose all sense of it.

		So what makes a good purpose?  or a good mission?
		- **LARGER** -- A satisfying mission is always _**larger**_ than the individual. 
			==> One important kind of larger mission is one that provides some kind valued service to the larger society.
		- **COMMUNAL** -- A satisfying mission is ideally _**communal**_ -- executed with-the-support-of and in-the-presence-of others.
			==> We are a communal species, we thrive on sharing both our missions and our physical space with others.
		- **ADVERSARIAL** -- A satisfying mission always has some _**adversarial**_ aspect which ensures its achievement is difficult.
			==> A satifying mission puts the individual in a kind of competition with the world around them:
				against the physical world, against the computational or social world, or competing with others trying to outperform other trying to achieve the same objective.
		- **PERSONAL** -- Also satifying mission is ideally very _**personal**_.  It is _freely chosen_ by the individual so it is personal in that sense, and the details of its execution are significantly affected by that individual as well.


		Human thriving exists in living of the tension created by this sometimes contradictory nature.  It requires: 
		- Having yolked _**onself**_ with missions
		- that are executed _**in-the-presence-of**_, _**in-collaboration-with**_, and _**in-competition-with**_ others
		- in order to provide some very _**personalized**_ value _**to the world**_ around themselves.


		**CAPITALISM**

		Capitalism is a near-miss in creating the conditions for human thriving -- it gets a few things right while badly missing on several others.  First here are the things it gets right:

		1. **DISTRIBUTED / SCALABLE / EFFICIENT** -- It is a distributed/localized decision making mechanism which can potentially scales very well as the total number of market participants grow to planet-wide sizes.  
		2. **ALIGNED / INDIVIDUALISTIC / ADVERSARIAL** -- It aligns well with core motivations inherent-in and quite entrenched-in natural human behavior.  Neither market mechanism is attempting to "reprogram" or force participants behaviors, but are instead attempting to "go with the flow" and build desired market behaviors from participants simply following their own doing self interest as they are naturally inclined to do.   
		3. **EMERGENT / AUTONOMOUS**


		And especially as they apply to specifically to IP Markets here are the things they get wrong:

		So capital markets as applied to IP goods are great for human thriving except:
		1. NARROW -- As applied to IP goods they leave the vast majority of humanity outside the limited set of strong wealth-generating contributors.
		2. ENSLAVING -- The chosen few that are among the strong-wealth generating contributors are forced into cog-in-the-wheel roles where they have little opportunity for control or ownership, and 
		3. DIFFERENTIATING -- These markets prioritize mission-destroying, market-inefficient quests for "sustainable differentiation".  These quests almost always involves identification and total domination of some crucial ingredient for success.  And then once obtained the winner then uses this control to starve all competitiors into submission or oblivion.  

		Other than these three issues capital markets are awesome.  :-)


		**VALUE MARKETS**

		Value markets, by contrast, retain key aspects of capital markets (as detailed in the XXX section) which support human thriving while rehibilitating the three issues above that do not.  At their value markets introduce three key innovations that address specific problems endemic to capital markets:

		1. **WALLED GARDEN** -- Value markets create a _**walled garden**_ that excludes capital from owning the fruits of human labor while still providing the liquidity and capital required to drive distributed "bottom up" innovation.
			==> The key here is to form a separated garden where capital generated directly from labor itself has special access allowing it to "own" of the future value of present labor.  External capital operates at a strong disadvantage.
	
		2. **SPLITTING COMPENSATION FROM CONTROL** -- In present capital markets the creation of some valuable intellectual property affords it creator both _**compensation**_ in charging others for it, as well as _**control**_ as other build from it.  In value markets we split these two aspects of IP creation.  Thus we can give compensation and credit to the creator, but deny them the control that a capital market would afford them.  This retains many virtues of capital markets, while limiting several very destructive aspects of capital markets (including search for sustained differentiation listed above).

		3. **HYPER SLICING** -- In present capital markets there is significant pressure towards bundling IP.  These bundles can become bottlenecks that serve as points of control and profit.  But they also become inhumanly large in scale and complexity.  As sources of human mission we need problems expressed and addressible on a human scale.  Ideally on the scale that a single person can choose to attack and have good chance of success.  Value markets have mechansims that expressly drive towards decompositions aiming back towards missions on a human scale.

		4. **JURISDICTION** -- Existing capital markets and governance systems typically provide a fixed (or global) governance structure.  This one-size-fits all approach results in in-humanly large governance system which are far too large for an individual to change or escape.  Value markets support a web of interoperating juristictions in which which provide ability for specialization for given subcommunities while still enabling the greater community to protect itself from excesses within any subcommunity.

### ### MOTIVATION AND BACKGROUND ###
##### --- CAPITALISM ---

		Capitalism is a near-miss in creating the conditions for human thriving -- it gets a few things right while badly missing on several others: 

		Capitalism provides ample opportunities for adversarial missions, but often not missions with larger aims or missions that are very personal.  Indeed capital markets as applied to intellectual property goods are often actively destructive to creation of missions.  In physical-goods markets the requrirement of transporting a good from producer to consumer, as well as the inherent limit on the number of consumers a single producer can serve both limit the effective size for a wealth-creation organizations.  Both of these limits are removed in intellectual property markets, leading to single, winner-take-all, planet-sized consumer markets for those IP goods.  

		The result is that only juggernauts having inhumanly large scale, complexity, and wealth can play in these markets.  And because these markets are IP markets and not physical-good markets the number of employees needed by these juggernauts does not scale with the number of consumers servedby them, but rather they scale with the complexity of the IP task that they solve.  Given the 6+ billion people on planet earth it appears that the scale of humanity is much larger than the scale of the IP tasks that are focused on by the juggernauts -- those IP tasks taht generate the most wealth.   

		This situation results in two problems for human thriving:  The first problem is that the vast majority of people will end up on the OUTSIDE of these wealth-generating juggernauts, rather than being productively employed within them.  Society can recitify the financial imbalance created by this using universal-basic-income, heavy taxing, etc. if it chooses.  But even if it does this, it still does not address the mission-crushing reality that most humans have no value for the leviathans that are producing the goods most valued by humanity.  They are relegated to production of goods with comparitively low value.  very sad.

		The second problem is the nature of the jugernaut itself.  While small compared to the sheer size of all of humanity, these juggernauts are nonetheless very large in absolute numbers of humans they employ.  In the winner-take-all markets of social-networks a company like Facebook or Twitter each have dozens of core products, with tens or hundreds of thousands of employees.  The leaves most workers with a very "cog-in-the-wheel" worker reality.  Most have relatively little scope or autonomy.  The problems-tackled and approaches-taken are decided at levels very far above them for most employees.  Their world is a sub-sub-sub piece of this much much larger whole.  For strong performers there is often notable autonomy within their "little box" in the organization, and this can be helpful for human thriving.  And even for these lucky few, the limited scope of their little box and the complete inability to control choose anything outside the box itself is very damaging to any sense of their job being their freely chosen mission of personal value.

		The third problem with these IP markets stems from the nature of the IP goods themselves.  Individual participants with capital markets seek to use their capital and labor in ways that yield greater returns than others could obtain given the same capital and labor.  But they dont seek to do this just once.  With IP goods there are large, up front, fixed costs required followed by potentially long periods of payback.  The problem in IP markets is that there is no barrier stopping others from also expending this fixed cost and then sharing-in and diluting ones own downstream payback.  Very quickly this kind of totally free and open IP market results in a race to the bottom where only a few of the largest scale busiesses can barely pay off their up front fixed costs using the razor thin downstream margins that are left over after this disasterous race to the bottom.

		Capital within capital markets generally runs away from these race-to-the-bottom markets.  Instead large pools of capital will focus nearly ALL of energy and attention towards situation that offer the possiblity of some "sustained differentiation".  In order to break free of this race to the bottom captial needs to identify a participant that has some means of ensuring they will indefinitely retain a strong advantage relative to ALL current and ALL future participants.  In IP markets this almost always involves identifying some crucial ingredient for sucess with in some area, and then arranging that one can completely _**dominate**_ this crucial ingredient.  This approach can be collossally lucrative in IP markets since these are winner-take-all and are planet-wide markets.  Several times a decade or some lucky company manages to dominate one of these incredients and become the newest titan among the worlds juggernauts.

		But this process is extremely mission-destroying for people on both sides of this game.  For those that are part of an existing juggernaut, their primary goal is not serving humanity....  Of course they have to do that too, but they have arranged some sustained differentiation that allows them to maintain their market position with less effort because of some "unfair advantage".  No, their focus is making sure they ALSO own the next unfair advantage too.  They must identify and dominate the next "bottleneck" resource.  The value of merely serving humanity is a distant second, compared with the goal of dominating the next bottleneck.  Allow another company to dominate the next bottleneck will in their area is often the near or actual death of a corporation, while better serving of a mature market can only gain small percents in market and profit.  Since that is where the money is, in a capital market, that is where all attention and focus goes.  This is very profitable and very mission destroying since the focus is on control and exclusion first of benefit to society only as much as it serves this primary goal of control and exclusion, but no further.  Very sad.

		Sustainable differentiation is such a good thing for participants in a capital market -- indeed the GOAL of participants in a capital market that we forget just how evil it really is.  Ones goal is not primarily to serve, but rather to ensure that one can EXCLUDE others from serving.  One extremely prevelant form of exclusion in today's markets are network effects.  At first glance they seem virtuous... after all isnt society as a whole better off as more and more people participate within a single system when there is a network effect at play?  The answer is yes.  But because of the virtuous cycle of increasing benefits based on network size, there can only be one winner of each type (unless the networks are very sticky, then it is possible to have a small number).  Either way it creates an immense captial incentive to identify and quickly scale newly-possible network effect system.  Chasing and owning these networks is where the money is!  Serving humanity generally has little comparative value in general.  But at the moment of network formation it become very critical since one wish to win over the human consumers into ones market.  Once the market is owned again it becomes less critical since one can easily keep the market and keep high profits.  Better to spend ones available capital identifying and dominating the next network-effect system.  Very profitable sport for the juggernauts but it leaves less opportunity to generate value by those outside those juggernauts since those winning juggernaut generally controls that market and fully controls how others can play within it, and who gets the profits from it.

		And it is mission destroying for those inside the juggernaut as well, since their biggest wins and greatest focus is on dominating the newer yet-unclaimed network effects, by comparison actually serving humanity is distant second in importance.  Strong success at the first with mediocre performance on the second yields a growing and profitable juggernaut, while strong success at the second with mediocre performance on the first yeild a has-been juggernaut soon to be eclipsed by others.  Very sad incentives.

		So capital markets as applied to IP goods are great for human thriving except:
		1. NARROW -- As applied to IP goods they leave the vast majority of humanity outside the limited set of strong wealth-generating contributors.
		2. ENSLAVING -- The chosen few that are among the strong-wealth generating contributors are forced into cog-in-the-wheel roles where they have little opportunity for control or ownership, and 
		3. DIFFERENTIATING -- These markets prioritize mission-destroying, market-inefficient quests for "sustainable differentiation".  These quests almost always involves identification and total domination of some crucial ingredient for success.  And then once obtained the winner then uses this control to starve all competitiors into submission or oblivion.  

		Other than these three issues capital markets are awesome.  :-)



		1. **WALLED GARDEN** -- Value markets create a _**walled garden**_ that excludes capital from owning the fruits of human labor while still providing the liquidity and capital required to drive distributed "bottom up" innovation.
			==> The key here is to form a separated garden where capital generated directly from labor itself has special access allowing it to "own" of the future value of present labor.  External capital operates at a strong disadvantage.
	
		2. **SPLITTING COMPENSATION FROM CONTROL** -- In present capital markets the creation of some valuable intellectual property affords it creator both _**compensation**_ in charging others for it, as well as _**control**_ as other build from it.  In value markets we split these two aspects of IP creation.  Thus we can give compensation and credit to the creator, but deny them the control that a capital market would afford them.  This retains many virtues of capital markets, while limiting several very destructive aspects of capital markets (including search for sustained differentiation listed above).

		3. **HYPER SLICING** -- In present capital markets there is significant pressure towards bundling IP.  These bundles can become bottlenecks that serve as points of control and profit.  But they also become inhumanly large in scale and complexity.  As sources of human mission we need problems expressed and addressible on a human scale.  Ideally on the scale that a single person can choose to attack and have good chance of success.  Value markets have mechansims that expressly drive towards decompositions aiming back towards missions on a human scale.

		4. **JURISDICTION** -- Existing capital markets and governance systems typically provide a fixed (or global) governance structure.  This one-size-fits all approach results in in-humanly large governance system which are far too large for an individual to change or escape.  Value markets support a web of interoperating juristictions in which which provide ability for specialization for given subcommunities while still enabling the greater community to protect itself from excesses within any subcommunity.



###### ,
		A value market seeks to maximize opportunites for personalized missions in a context that encourages "good" competition, while limiting "bad" competition.


		Value markets limit the coercive control patterns that are prevelant in capital-based IP market, while retaining the individual's autonomy, decision-making, ownership and compensation for their contributions.  What is removed is the ability for an individual or orgnaization to utlize earlier contributions to shape and control the market in ways that limit other's subsequent market contributions.

		One can get credit and compensation for what one produces, but this cannot be use that to gain any kind of lock or control over the subsequent market contributions from others.  One might create a novel API and capability and contribute it to the market, thus getting credit and compensation over time for the value generated by that contribution.  But it was contributed TO the market.  It is no longer owned by the individual, they do continue to get credit and compensation for having contributed it, but they CANNOT exert any control over how others might build upon it or use it in the future.  It is no longer "owned" in that sense.

		**VALUE MARKETS**

		As outlined in the introduction value markets retain key aspects of capital markets (as detailed in the XXX section) which support human thriving while rehibilitating the three issues above that do not.  Value markets introduce three key four key innovations that address specific problems endemic to capital markets:
		- **WALLED GARDEN** -- A separation ensuring that participants not capital gain lionshare of benefits from the market.
		- **SEPARATION OF COMPENSATION FROM CONTROL** -- Ensures that quest for sustained differntiation does not become an enslaving force.  Instead markets become enablers of human freedom.
		- **HYPER SLICING** -- Drives both contributions and decision making down to human scales.
		- **JURISDICTION** -- Escaping the one-size-fits-all model of governance which itself may not serve all markets, and which itself becomes it own kind of enslavement.



		--- **WALLED GARDENS** ---

		The first departure from capital markets is the way that value markets handle capital.  The virtue of a capital markets is the way that emergent decision making from these markets can cause capital to magically flow to those places where it is to those places where it is most likely to have the greatest economic impact.  The importance of this ability just cannot be over stated.  This mechanism is by far the most effective mechanism humanity has ever devised in the face of a highly uncertain world with extremely difficult and complex tradeoffss to assess.  Nothing like it.  Nothing comes close.  We have tried other stuff, just fuggeditaboutit!  On complex/uncertain problems they all loose.

		Yet it is also these same flows of capital that forms the chains which enslave the worker as well.  

		The value-market innovation is to segregate investment capital obtained from _contributors and consumers_ of market activity from capital that is _external_ to this market activity, and then to strongly or even exclusively bias rewards towards the contributors and consumers.  This "walled garden"-innovation is acheieved by creating a seperate unicoin currency which only contributors and consumer have access to.  This allows the market to dynamically set the terms which are just good enough for external capital to participate but not dominate the profits obtained from the markets.  The lionshare of the profits flow back to the contributors and consumers that make up the market.

		The split is justified at one level since both contributors and consumers in the market are what make it what it is today, they are solely responsible for the value that the market contains so it is natural that they would reap the lionshare of its rewards.  Secondly this is justified becasuse it aligns the choices made by the market with the contributors and consumers whose lives are strongly shaped by how that capital is applied.  Only cash that was recently earned by market participation exists as unicoin within the walled garden, and thus only contributors and consumers have access to the outsized returns possible within the walled garden. (e.g. capital earned within the last 15 or so years)

		_EXTERNAL CAPITAL_ - Because (at least for now) these value markets still must successfully compete within a larger capital market system there may be practical cases where the capital generated within the value market is not sufficient to compete in the larger winner-take-all IP capital markets.  In this case the entire marketplace can elect to allow external capital into the value market in some limited ways and in order to reap some defined limited rewards for that participation.  The exact details of this participation would vary on a case by case basis, since the market participants don't want to give up more control and profits than then need to, but at the same time do need to provide enough incentive for big money from the outside the market to partner with the market itself in order to win certain parts of the larger IP capital markets.  Still notice even when the value market is making this concession, the shoe is on the other foot!  It is the value market controlled only by the contributors and consumer, that, on-a-case-by-case-basis decide how much profit and control to cede to external capital.  Within an IP-based capital market with more potential performers than is required it is always the reverse, it is capital that decided how much profits are to be shared.  In an IP-based capital market capital always has the advantage.  Further, as the value market grows and the capital produced by prior participatns grows t he market place itself grows its own internal abilty to fund new efforts in a way that dramatically reduces the need for external capital (See "the fund" in the details section).  Over time the market itself will be able to keep all profits and self fund new efforts without any external funding.



		**--- SEPARATING CREDIT, COMPENSATION & CONTROL ---**

		The second innovation of value markets is the separation of credit and compensation verses control.  To illustrate this idea we use the example of Facebook.  Mark Zuckerberg helped created & currently owns much of Facebook.  Since Facebook exists within a capital market with now standardized IP protection rules this "ownership" affords Mark all three aspects listed above.  He gets significant credit, significant compensation, and nearly full control over Facebook and all of the value that comes from the vast interconnected network of Facebook contributors (its users).  But it need not be this way.  If the rules of the market were different, then one could slice and dice credit, compensation, and control in different ways... The compensation and control that Mark has today is simply a consequence of the rules of the marketplace, they could be (and should be) different.

		Value markets really tweak the idea-of and the rules-around creation and ownership quite a bit.  This new way of thinking about this does take some mental adjustments in order to "get" the logic behind this new model.  Here are some carrots to entice the reader to try to see ownership in this new way.  First this new model still retains significant doses of the hard-edged, take-no-prisoners, high-risk, high-reward aspects of current capital market competition.  This ain't no UBI, welfare-state, spread-the-wealth-evenly kind of market model, it definitely does have winner and loosers.  Still it DOES significantly clip the wings of the capitalist, and it also defeats many of the winner-take-all exclusionary tricks that current IP-based capital market now revolve around.  In this new value market, Mark Zuckerberg would get rich off of his Facebook innovation, but he would NOT get stupid rich from it, nor would he enjoy the kind of exlusionary control that he enjoys now.

		To wrap ones head around how value markets work it is helpful to imagine value market ownership as a multi-step process:
		1. **CREATION** -- In the first step a contribution is created, perhaps as a derivative of some work that is already within the market.
			At this first instant in time the contribution is still fully owned by its creator, it is not part of the market and it in no way can affect the market or anything that happens within the market.
		2. **SUBMISSION** -- In the second step the participant elects to give complete and perpetual access to their contibution over to the market.  They need not do this of course, they can keep it all for themselves, but the marketplace will not touch the work, sell it, or build upon it, until they do transfer CONTROL over.
		3. **CREDIT** -- The market uses a combination of factors to assign "credit" for the contribution.  The market is interested in correctly providing credit to the submitter for this contribution but also to others that should also get credit for this contribution.  Just as IP ownership in present IP-based markets, this step is complex and nuanced. (See the credit assignment section for details.)
		4. **COMPENSATION** -- The market does not know the full value of a given contribution at time of submission.  There may be a known minimal value, in which case that value can be immediately transferred.  More often the true value of the contribution will become known over time as others use and build upon the contribution.  In that way value markets can be more accurate but also slower is assigning a compensation value for a component, than capital markets are.  Thus value markets pay compensation over an extended period of time for a given contribution based on its usage.
		5. **CONTROL** -- Finally and perhaps most controvercially value market NEVER assign significant control back to the contributor.  It is this control that is the root of many evils in present capital markets, so value markets dodge this bullet by simply refusing to afford this control back to any participant.  One can think of this as owning the credit and compensation normally associated with value creation in a capital market, but NOT owning any of the control that would typically accrue to the creator of a thing.

		To understand how this might playout at a high level, we can continuing with our Facebook example from above:  Within a value market, Zuckerberg would recieve _credit_ for having conceived of the idea of a social network and credit for having reduced that idea to practice.  He would receive significant _compensation_ for all subsequent usage of his social network and even receive compensation for other social-network-like-things contributed to the market too.  But he would in NO WAY recieve control of that or any social network.  No one would.  Instead, ANY other contributor could invent extensions to this social network.  Any contributor could (after being vetted for privacy by the market) offer users options to user their data in any other networks, etc.  All code, all APIs, and all data would be entirely owned by the marketplace itself or by the end user, and would be available for extension by all.

		This intentionally oblierates any hope one might have of using any kind of network effect to drive a sustainable differentiation.  Individuals that believe they have identified a new kind of network effect or big money hoping to drive such network effects will HATE this aspect of the value market!  It destroys the very thing they are hoping to achieve.  In order to entice such individuals to contribute such things into the market, the value market does attempt to signifcantly compensation novel introduction into the marketplace.  Nonetheless, by design, it will never match the outsize returns that dominating control of an important network effect like Facebook can bring.  So those players will likely never bring their innovation directly into the market.  Still, unless blocked by insurmoutable patent, the market can create similar network effects within the market itself.  And many consumers may come to value the open, non-coercive nature of network effects as they are shared within a value market and may choose to use the facebook inside the value market instead of the external "Zuckerberg get rich" Facebook.  Further, becuase the internal facebook is not centerally controlled and many contributors can use it to generated strong wealth, many market contributors will innovate ontop of these networks.  Thus, over time, it is possible that networks with the market may out perform similar networks outside the value-market given the greater participation internal solutions enjoy.

		In any case, it is a large difference betweent the types of markets, and it is driven not out of a desire for faster innovation, but rather out of a desire to avoid the "bad" competition that stems from the maneuvering and resource spending that occurs in trying to gain dominating control of these network effects.

		**--- HYPER SLICING ---**

		A third problem with capital markets as they apply to IP goods and services is the inhuman size of the contributions require to make and advancement.  By the nature knowlege goods almost all efforts required are bundled into the heavy fix costs required to produce them.  Once this is done a much smaller or sometimes non-existent variable costs occurs after that.  Because these markets are planet wide many of the "easy" items have already been supplied once, and now they are available for use.  What remains are the items that are less than obvious, items that wont yield a purchasable benefit, and items that are larger and more complex to build.  None of these are really great fodder for building ones mission around.

		**MARKET OBJECTIVE** -- The _**objective**_ of a value market is to maximize the producer-to-consumer value transfers occuring within the market subject to the constraint that these transfers are not destructive to human thriving or other concerns of societal importance.

		- **MAXIMIZATION SYSTEM** -- To a first approximation a value market is simply a distributed decision making mechansim for maximizing value transfer within the market itself.  
		- **ESCAPE HATCH** -- The limiting constraint is added as a kind of escape hatch from the markets core functioning in cases where that core functioning is clearly going off the rails.
		- **VALUE ASSESSMENT** -- The value of a given transfer is inherently measured in terms of the utility it has for the recipient of that transfer.
			- GLOBALLY ASSESSED -- 


		MARKET PROPERTIES -- In service of the objective of a value market, they are expected to satify the market properties listed here.  In various ways these properties have been show to have value for the works of such a market.

		- DISTRIBUTED -- Humanity has melinnia of experience with different mechanisms for decision making.  Clear that as complexity grows the need to distribute societal decision making become essentail.  Thus societal/market goals are generally not achieve directly, but rather as emergent properties of a distributed decision mechansim where each market participant are freely choosing actions from some market-constrainted set of possiblities.

		The section details the workings of a value market independent from the motivations and reasons for choices shown here.
		The section focuses exclusively on formally how the market operates.  It is broken down into several large sections:
		- **TERMS** -- This section details the terms used to formalize the market mechanism.
		- **FINANCIAL SYSTEM** -- This section details the major components of the financial system, and how they interoperate.
		- **CREDIT ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM** -- Fine-grained credit assignment is what allows this market mechanism to slice problems down to human sized bites, and is also the mechansim that defeats the "lock-in" effect that occur within traditional IP-based, capital markets.
		- JURSIDICTIONAL SYSTEM -- Traditional governance models tend to be monolithic with fixed structures.  Requiring a single universal set of rules that apply uniformly to all products, all consumers, and all contributors is very dis-empowering to the individual and is sure to fail to align with the values and desires of at least some market participants.  The value market's jurisdictional system allows both contributor and consumer to each choose the jursidiction from which they operate, and the mechanism derives the rules that will be in force for each interaction.


		_
#### === TERMS ===



		_MARKET PLACE TERMS_

		**MARKETPLACE** -- A _**marketplace**_ collection of participants connected by a web of contributions that are produced (contributed) by some and consumed by others.

		**CONTRIBUTION** -- A _**contribution**_ is a specific version of some intellectual property that was produced by a particular contributor at a particular moment in time.  Each contribution may derive in part from one or more prior contributions of this or other producers.

		**PARTICIPANT** -- A _**participant**_ is an individual that is, in some way, participating in a marketplace.

		**PRODUCER / CONTRIBUTOR** -- A  _**producer**_ or _**contributor**_ is an individual that, by their own effort, produces some contribution that is subsequently used by others within the marketplace

		**CONSUMER** -- A _**consumer**_ is a market participant that uses (consumes) end product(s) from the marketplace.



		_FINANCE TERMS_

		**UNICOIN / UNI** -- The coin used within a value market is called Unicoin (UNI). Unicoin is a stable coin in the sense that it has a kind of tether to the USD.  But it is not a full currency in that it, by design, is redeemable, but non-transferrable.  This property is central to the value market ensuring the fruits of labor are always received by that labor and not by capital or the owners of capital.

		**THE FED** -- The Fed is a fully mechanical market-making mechanism for managing the supply of unicoin.  It seeks to maintain unicoin market liquidity with a robust and prediable relationship to USD or other target currencies.

		**THE BANK** -- The bank transparently holds USD-denominated assets in service of various market participants.
		For market safety the actual assets are held and transparently managed by existing large tradional institutional investment firms (e.g. Vanguard).  Assets are transparently managed in the sense that agreements are in place where any fund movments in these accounts are published publically before or at the time of transfer.

		**THE FUND** -- An investment fund that owns all intellectual property (IP) contributed into the market place.  
		Shares in this fund are may only be purchased by market participants based on currency they obtain by their personal  efforts.  (Any kind of capital market conversion fund shares is specifically disallowed)



		_CREDIT ASSIGNMENT TERMS_

		**COMPONENT** -- A _**component**_ is a named, versioned sequence of contributions that has an identified purpose, structure, and function.  (It maybe helpful to think of a component as a repository or a defined subpart of a repository, and a contribution as a single commit to that repository.)

		**DEPENDENCY DAG** -- The marketplace _**dependency DAG (DD)**_ is a collection of contributions, components, and end products within a marketplace forming a complex DAG linking end product consumption with all contributors for that product.  The tops of this DAG are the end products produced by the marketplace.  Immediately below these are the components that make up those products.  Recursively below each component are its contributing sub-components.  The lowest levels of the DD are the contributions produced by specfic contributors.

		**END PRODUCT** -- An _**end product**_ is a component that is not primarily inteneded to be a sub-part of another component within the marketplace but rather is inteneded to be directly used (consumed) by indiviuals within the marketplace.
		 type of contribution designed to be

		**FRONT** -- A _**front**_ or _**store front**_ is the producer that packages, brands, and markets end products for consumption by consumers.

		**COMPONENT MAINTAINERS** -- A component maintainer is a participatn that is authorized to accept contributions that alter a component.  A maintainer role is adjudicate which contributions are moving the component forward -- which should be accepted.  The maintainer may or may not be the author of these contributions.

		**COMPONENT LEAD MAINTAINER** -- the individual authorizes others (and themselves) to be one of the maintainers of a system.

		**COMPONENT CONTRIBUTORS** -- adding somehting

		**COMPONENT FORK** -- 



		_JURSIDICTIONAL TERMS_

		**JURISDICTION** -- A _**jurisdiction**_ is a collection of term definitions and governance rules expressed in a combination of natural and computational languages.  Together these define and constrain the operation of the a market place.

		**THE BOARD** -- The market place conscience 

		**THE COURT** -- 

		**OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTION** -- An _**open source contribution**_ is one that is provided with a fully unencumbered licence.

		**CREDITED CONTRIBUTION** -- A _**credited contribution**_ is a contribution whose terms are dictated by its jurisdiction of contribution.  Its conceptual and textual derivation from other earlier one that tracks the contributions and sub-components used in its creation.  Typically crediting is performed in order to provide some value back to those producers that expended effort in the creation of this component.  Typically ensuring some value back requires some form of constraint on how the component may be used which makes the component not fully open source.  Typically components retain many open-source-like properties since the explict aim of the marketplace is to maximize value transfer.

#### === THE MARKET MECHANISM ===
##### --- CASH FLOW ---

		Before diving into the details it is helpful to follow cash through this system as a way of understanding how it works.

		**UNICOIN** 
		- **CURRENCY** -- Unicoin is a "participation currency", it is given to both producer and a bit to the consumer for each value transfer from creator(s) to consumer.
		- **WALLED GARDEN** -- The purpose of unicoin to provide a separated currency that blocks the traditional capital markets from having access-to and owning-of the fruits of human labor.  Only the participants in a value market have a legitimate right to the fruits of that market.

		**FED** 
		- **MARKET MAKER** -- The Fed is the market maker for the unicoin currency.  It accepts external currencies like USD creates new unicoin to provide in exchange, and accepts unicoin that it burns in return for external currencies.
		- **TETHER** -- The FED maintains a 1-to-1 tethered relationship between USD and Unicoin on the sell side.
		- **MEMBER BANK** -- The FED uses a collection of member banks to hold the USD denominated assets it will use in order to maintain its 1-to-1 tethered peg for Unicoin.  Member bank accounts are implemened as a public trust managed by existing banking insitutions (e.g. Vanguard or Chase).  Part of the trust's mandate is to publish holding balances and transfers on a daily basis.
		- **NON-TRANSFERRABLE** -- Unicoin is a non-transferrable asset.  Coins are given for market participation and may be redeemed for cash, but not transferred. (to avoid having a capital market)
		- **UNICOIN SELLING** -- Unicoin selling is always performed by dividing total USD held by total outstanding Unicoin.  This ensures the FED can always maintain its peg.
		- **ACCELERATION** -- As USD are paid for value transfers this cash is provided to the Fed and is converted into uncoin at a rate less than 100% of the current selling price, this gap ensures that over time the Fed's USD per Unicoin ratio will go up.  The higher the market place volume, the faster unicoin appreciates relative to USD.  This incentivises participants to hold Unicoin.

		**SIMPLE PAYMENT FOR SERVICES RENDERED**
		- **FRONTS** -- Various store fronts provide goods & services in exchange for subscription fees or one-time USD payments.
		- **CONVERSION** -- This incoming USD is converted by the FED into unicoin, so each front receives a stream of unicoin.
		- **CREDIT ASSIGNMENT** -- The value DAG is programmatically used to partition coins among all contributing components.
		- **CREDIT ASSIGNMENT** -- Over time multiple participants have contributed to these components, coins distributed to each component are further partitions programmatically down to all contributing producers for these components.
		- **DISTRIBUTION** -- Participants may elect use the FED to covert their recieved unicoin back into USD & simply spend it.

		**THE FUND -- PARTICIPANT INVESTING**
		- **INVESTING** -- Alternately participants may invest in the future of the marketplace itself by buying shares in the fund.
		- **STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS** -- The fund uses these investments accumulated over time in order to make strategic investments intended to grow the marketplace itself.
		- **UNICOIN SPENDING** -- The fund can drive and shape the larger community's investments in the development of specific IP by paying for and contributing to the development of those specific capabilities or components.  In exchange for these early investments the fund receives a portion of the future value produced by these components.
		- **USD SPENDING** -- The fund can covert unicoin into USD and use this for marketing, strategic alliances, or any other outward facing methods for growing its value.
		- **BOUNTY PROGRAMS** -- The fund may create a variet of bounty style programs where specific guaranteed funds are specified for the completion of certain components or capabilities, where the fund will receive some defined future compensation for from the usage of those capabilities.

##### --- TRANSACTION ALLOCATION ---
###### -- Subscription Bundle's revenue split into Product -- 

		Bundle Rev Split -- A bundle's revenue split is the fraction of a subscription bundle's revenue which is attributed to the particular items available within that bundle


		**ABSTINANCE TESTING** -- An _**abstinance testing**_ measures the relative value of a product to one of its regular users gaining access to the product via their purchase of a bundle.


		HOW IT WORKS
		1. Over time small fractions of customers are selected to participate in an abstinance test.
			Before the test begins the participants are selected, a set of products are selected for each participant, and a hidden random abstinance target is selected for each product.
		2. The customers are asked if they want to participate in the abstinance test and are told what their participation reward will be, and are also given a hash code for the list of products randomly chosen for them.  Those who decline to participate stop at this step.
		3. Each agreeing customer is then presented with a list of SHOW products and are asking what rebate would they require in order to abstain from the use of this regularly used product for some period of TIME.  (e.g. SHOW might be 40 products and TIME might be 1 month)
		4. The customer specifies an abstinance price for some each shown product.  
			(They need not provide a price for all items.)
		5. The list of "abstinance" products for a given participant is the subset of shown product where the participant selected an abstinace amount that is LESS than the hidden randomly selected target amount.
		6. For each abstinance product:
			- The participant's access to the product is disable for the specified period of time, and
			- The participant is paid the amount they selected for each product.
		7. As long as they selected MIN product abstinance prices within some hidden "resonablness range" they will be rewarded the participation reward regardless of how many abstinance products they selected.


		WHY IT WORKS
		- Each participation is motivated to provide an accurate abstinance price.
			- If they price too low they are stuck without having access to the product for too little money
			- If they set the price too high they are missing out on cash in cases where they went above the hidden target price.
		- Particpants are given a reward for just participating in order to incentivise them to spend the time to think about what pricing they would accept.  (this is especially important for wealthier demographics that prize their time over money.  They can be given a high participation fee in order to collect their data)
		- Participants cannot "pretend" to participate since they will earn no fee if they just pick a bunch of outlandish prices, they must select real prices that might cause them to forcably be without the product.

###### -- Capability Allocation Assessment -- 


		HOW CAPABILITY ALLOCATIONS ARE DETERMINED

		- ALLOCATION -- Each participant in the marketplace receives coin allocations directly or inidirectly for their participation within the marketplace.  The unicoin may be redeemed by the FED for traditional usd.

		- REVENUE ALLOCATION -- Consumers make purchases directly at different seller store fronts, each of which advertise, price, and bundle the products sold.  These dollars are converted by the FED into coin allocations for each seller.  The resulting coins are called the _**revenue allocation**_ for that seller.

		- COMMONS RATIO -- Each node in the sellers tree has a _**commons ratio**_, this is the fraction of all allocations for all decendants that is automatically diverted upto this node for distribution.  The allocations for each node is calculated from top of tree to the bottom.  Each node's allocation is taken from all revenue allocation of all descendants of the top.  Then child nodes take their allocation as a fraction of the remining revnue allocations.  Finally the revenue generating nodes retain all remaining allocation.

		- NET ALLOCATION -- Each seller node then has a net allocation which results after taking into account all direct revenue allocations it receives minus allocations diverted upwards based upon the commons ratios above, then adding in allocations from its own commons ratios (if it has one).  This net allocation is the allocation that is under direct control of this seller node (as controlled by weighted voting of all direct revenue allocations for descendents of this seller node.) from below  based on the inflows and outflows caused by its commons ratios above and below it as well as by the  it directly recieve.

		- CAP ALLOCATIONS -- Each seller node divides its net allocation among across allocations it makes to various capability groups within the caps tree.
			- The split is chosen by revenue weighted voting of all descendants of the seller node.
			- The capability allocations specify a node within the caps tree to receive the funds as well as the type of funding being provided.  e.g. if it is for mantaince, growth, or for some spot feature.

		- allocations 

		- of each incoming childs allocation that is automatically diverted up to the parent node.  Each node in the market 

		-  of revenue each   this is the percentage that each of  its children's revenue which is automatically diverted to up to this node.  


		WHY THIS WORKS
		- **COMMONS RATIO** -- 
			- This money is used to avoid the 'tragedy of the commons' where each participant only funds special capabilties importnat to itself, trying to force others to fund capabilities which are important for all.  
			- Since the parent node's resource allocation is voted on by the entire group, that group will naturally want to fund these common capabilities in proportion to their respective need for funds for stability and improvement, and will not favor specilist needs since it is voted by all.
			- Level setting -- At first it might seem that allowing each node to vote to set the percentage of allocation that it controls would result it in INCREASING its control.  But this is not correct, since those voting are the very children nodes whose revenue is being TAKEN.  Realizing this it might seem they might vote to drive this fraction downward towards zero, but that is also incorrect, since each child node knows the best way to fund commonly required capabilities is to increase the funds available at the parent that way they ensure that OTHER children also pay for their part of those common capabilities.  This will lead to a balance where each child votes up to the place where they feel the common vote will start voting for things that are not essential, and it would prefer to retain more control.
			- TOP TO BOTTOM -- Allowing commons ratio at multiple places in the tree allow for the funding of universally valuable capabilities high where one can ensure that all children will pay according to their usage of them (their income from them).  Then intermediate levels can pay for more specilized capabilites which are of specific interest to the sub-portion of the tree.  

		- **CAP ALLOCATIONS** --
			- At each level within the seller tree the cap allocations made are expected to ONLY focus on those capabilities that are of speific interest to its constituents.  
			- If there are more general capabilities they require the will push to up the commons ratio for some level above themselves in order to cause EVERYONE to fund those commonly required caps.
			- Likewise any specility capability will not receive sufficient votes for this level, and will need to receive its allocation from lower in the seller tree.
			- At each seller node there is total freedom in assigning their allocations ANYWHERE in the caps tree using any kind of funding type (e.g. spot vs growth), and assigning to a broad range of caps by funding higher in the caps tree, or more targeted by funding lower towards the leaves of the cap tree.
			- Naturally higher nodes in the seller tree will focus on caps that provide very broad benefit to many sellers within the market, while lower nodes will make more targeted allocations.
			- Further higer levels in the seller tree (as well as "the fund") will likely care more about the longer term health and vitality of the whole market place and will thus likely make LESS targeted allocations; allocations that are higher in the caps tree, that are not spot features, but genearalized growth and maintance allocations, and allocations that are historical allocations providing ongoing incentives for by rewarding historical work.

			- Each seller node allocation's are expected to ONLY focus on capabilities that are important

		**KINDS OF ALLOCATIONS** -- Each capability receive's it allocations in several specified kinds which indicate constrains on how that allocation may be used.

			**SPOT ALLOCATIONS** -- Spot money is provided for the delivery of some specific new feature or ability for the capability.  Spot money need not fully cover the new feature, but is only paid upon completion of the feature as measure by some formal or informal acceptance critera.
	
			**GROWTH ALLOCATIONS** -- Discretionary resources afforded to a capablity of pool of capabilities to be used to improve the functionality of those capabilities as desired by their contributors, and as desired by the product owners whose products use those capabilities.
	
			**MAINTAINANCE ALLOCATION** -- Resources that are provided for the maintaince of a given capablity or pool of capabilities.  They may be used for debugging, testing, and running the capability (paying maintainer retention), but many not be used to pay for any extensions in capability. Maintaince money may only be spent in order to achive some stated target level of robustness.
	
			**HISTORICAL ALLOCATIONS** -- _**Historical allocations**_ are allocations that are awarded in the present for capability work that had been done in the past.  These may are ear marked for previous spot, growth, and maintaince allocations that were done a some point in the past.  Each historical allocation specifiy a reward function which typically computed as a function of distance into the past as well as the allocation that was awarded in the past.  (with more recent and larger contributions getting more of the historical allocation)


		CONTRIBUTION ASSESSMENT
			ASSESSMENT BY TASK -- 
			**ASSESSMENT BY HOUR** -- _**Hourly allocations**_ are assigned per hour worked rather than based on meeting specific required output  targets.  This work requires much less logistical overhead, but requires greater trust.  Hourly work is only availble in specified amounts to specifically qualifying contributors (who have demonstrated sufficient quality, integrity, and velocity).  Any spot, growth, or maintaince allocations may be voted to be converted to hourly allocations.

		TASK PROPOSAL
		- TASK ASSESSMENT -- Task assessment determines the allocation payable for the completion of the task on a task by task basis.
		- ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA -- The acceptance critera for a task may be implicit, informal, or precise.  
			- Implicit critera depend upon community determined critera for indicating completion of a task. (e.g. it is not complete without some level of documentation or functional testing, etc.)
			- Informal critera build upon implicit by specifying some aspects of the acceptance critera qualitively 
			- Precise critera add quantitative or precisely defined critera for specifying acceptability.
		- PROPOSED PRICING -- The creator of a task 
		- SPOT TASKS have a base allocation set by the seller for their completion.  The cap itself may add funds to this allocation if it decides the work is valuable, but the funds are not sufficient.
		- INTERNAL SPOT TASKS -- members 

		TASK PRICING
		- PRICING CAP -- Each task has an allocation cap, this is maximum of the median allocation indicated by the tier one contributors for this task or the spot price given by the sellers.

###### FULL FED MODEL

		THE FED -- Within the value market _**THE FED**_ is the algorithm used by the market place to serve a function a kin to a service provided by the US Federal Reserve serves -- namely the printing and destruction of the unicoin currency used by the value market.

		MEMBER BANK -- The member banks of the value market are traditional banks within the existing financial system who have agreed to hold account balances for the value market trust.

		VALUE MARKET TRUST -- The value market trust is a legal entity that owns and controls all USD held by the FED.  The value market trust is controlled by a legal document which specifies that it member banks must download an auto-building FED CHAIN NODE and maintain and securely maintain this system under their control, and execute transactions as indicated by this system.

		FED CHAIN NODE -- The Fed chain is a block chain and block chain algorithm that execute the functioning of the market place and records the transactions as executed by the market place.


		Key aspects:
		- 100% algorithmic mechanism for converting between USD and UNI
		- Maintain's account balances for all market participants.  (this is very different than existing FED)
		- Ensures market liquidity and the 1 to 1 tethering peg for UNI to USD conversions
		- Creates and destroys Unicoin as USD is enters and leaves the marketplace
		- FED is constructed to safeguard the interests of all participants who have contributed to the value contained within the marketplace.
		- Thus FED policies are voted on and ratified by a weighted vote of all Unicoin holding participants.
		- The value market place limits the tyranny of wealth accumulated by prior generations over existing labor, by having transfers between individuals subject to heavy "estate-like-tax"

		Unlike the US Federal Reserve, this value market's Fed allows no room for any politics it is a simple algorithm that is based upon a few parameters which are voted on by the market place coin holders as a whole.

		The fed mechanism is designed to represent the will of the historical participants of the marketplace.  It is those historical participants that built up the value which exists within the market place thus it is natural that their interests are the ones being honored by the Fed -- the instituion charged with managing the currency that serves as a proxy for that numerically 



		HOW THE FED WORKS

		FED MATH
		- MEMBER BANKS -- The fed transparently handles a store of USD; which is maintained across a set of member banks.  These banks are conventional USD handling institutions (e.g. Chase, JP Morgan, or Vanguard)
		- UNICOIN REDEMPTION RATE (URR) -- Any holder of Unicoin may redeem that coin for USD at any time.  
			Each unicoin is redeemed for an amount of USD equalled to the URR = USD_balance / COIN_count, where
			- USD_balance is the the total USD transparently held by the fed, and 
			- COIN_count is the total number of outstanding Unicoin in circulation.
			- NOTICE: this ensures that even if all coin holder demand to have their coin redeemed at the same time, the FED will have the funds to pay all w/o dropping the payout rate.
		- UNICOIN PURCHASE RATE (UPR) -- As USD is provided to one of the member banks for induction into the market place, the fed will conconcurrently create new Unicoin and assign that new unicoin to the depositer of that currency.  The purchase rate is a simple fixed fraction of the unicoin redemption rate.
		- UNICOIN DISCOUNT RATE (UDR) -- The discount rate is the percentage of money lost in a round trip from USD to UNI and back.  Formally:  UDR = (1 - UPR) / UDR
		- The entire marketplace as well as the existing labor force (somehow vote) on changes to this discount rate.

		FED CHAIN ALGORITHM
		- The fed chain algorithm specifies how USD and Unicoin are converted, as well as how coins are allocated in response to marketplace purchases.  
		- The fed chain algorithm uses public/private key technologies to ensure that only valid actors may record each piece of information onto the block chain.

		FED CHAIN NODE
		- Each member bank runs a fed chain node, as does the fed itself, and anyone else who desires to track the working of the value market.
		- The fed chain does not rely on either proof of work nor proof of stake in order to ensure correct execution of the fed chain algorithm.  Instead since we are already relying on each member bank 
		- 

		- The fed maintains a block chain in order to provably ensure correct processing of both coin and dollar.
		- FED CHAIN software run on computers local to each member bank are used to record redemptions of Unicoin based on cryptographically signed requests and only into one of that account holder's tied accounts.
		- In this way only the holder of that account holder's private key can initiate such a transfer.
		- Likewise market place purchase orders are signed by the relevant store front so the Fed can only create new Unicoins in conjuction with a deposit at a member bank and a cooresponding purchase order from some store front.
		- Determination of all allocation related choices are all also recorded on the fed chain.  This means that all subsequence account balance transfers that result from  the value market's allocation mechanism are entirely computable from data on the fed chain.
		- The means all fed chain watching systems are in a position to verify the full working of the value market place prior to execution of any transaction.
		- Fed chain is neither proof of work, nor proof of stake based.  The assumption is that each member bank will faithfully execute the chain algorithm as automatically built from sources on a machine that they control.  This is part of the trust chart. ey control

		FED LEGAL
		- The USD funds held by the FED are held in accounts at tradional banking institutions.
		- Legally the funds held in these banks are held by a trust whose charter requires that funds managed by each trust are managed according to the rules of the market chain as indicated by outputs of their copy of the FED CHAIN software.
		- At a practical level these trusts will accept and disburse funds as the FED CHAIN algorithms indicates.
		- So notice no human owns the funds managed by the fed, thus no human has legal right to control them.
		- Further since the trust charter indicates that transactions may only be executed in accordance with the fed chain algorithms, those funds are as secure as long as the fed chain algorithm remains secure.
		- REDEMPTION SECURITY -- In the case that the fed chain were not functioning for some reason the last valid block can be used to support redemptions at a member bank.  The block chain maintains an assignment of account to member banks in case of failure, this one member bank can be used to redeem that account holder's shares w/o communication with the chain

		SECURTY AND ASSURANCES
		- The value marketplace's security rests on several assumptions:
			- Member banks execute the terms of the trust incorporation docs as legally specified.
			- Fed chain algorithm is correct.  This algorithm is heavily vetted and is in the open.
			- The trust also contains a number of provisions that limit the damage that any bugs in the chain algorithm might have, or loss of keys etc.  These provisions throttle cash outflows and require extra validation steps in certain cases.

		- The correct execution of a value market is entirely validatable by market chain validation.
		- This ensures that even as the balance books for the market swell in value, there is very little that the managers of the value market can do in order to embezzle funds.  
		- Each member bank is an established multi-billion dollar bank within the existing banking systems.
		- Each of these member bank is running its own copy of the fed chain algorithm, and 
		- Because the fed chain algorithm is open source and well vetted by the community, and entirely depends upon private keys held by various participants in order to construct valid entries, the whole system is quite protected from bad actors.


		CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SYSTEM
		- The FED can always pay its bills.  Specifically even if all holders of Unicoin wanted to redeem all coins at once, the Fed would be able to service all requests without running out of USD, and without needing to reduce the rates it uses to pays to each Unicoin holder.
		- The value of unicoin goes up over time.  The rate of appreciation is tied to the discount rate.  A discount rate of 10% would mean that 90% of each purchase is awarded to the relevant store front while 10% is not awarded.  This 10% means that the ratio of USD to UNI will go up over time.
		- This provides an incentive to hold the Unicoin that one obtains from one's participation in the marketplace.  The rate of appreciation is a function of the volume of unicoin entering the market in the form of purchase divided by the total number of unicoin that are held within marketplace accounts.
		- Providing this incentive likely increases the participants willing to put their prior earnings into "the fund" which in turn invests most of its proceeds back into the market place. (see "the fund" to understand how these reinvested labor outputs end up making the laborer rich while not allowing external capital to "buy into" the market.)


		_
##### --- THE FUND ---

		((move to section on ))
			-  
			- Setting a healthy (larger) discount rate will greatly encourage saving ones earning as Unicoin and not converting directly into USD.  
			- This in turn will increase unicoin available for investing into "the fund".
			- Much of the coin invested the fund will be reinvested into the market place as spot bounties growth fees.
			- This will drive yet further work developing assets that are controlled by the marketplace.
			- Which will result is yet more Unicoin which can be reinvested.
			- The circular process will expand as long as participants see the future value they will be obtaining from continued delay in taking payments are worth the wait.


		- This last point is super important



		WHY THIS WORKS
		- REPLACES CAPITAL WITH LABOR -- The key Virtue of a value market it the it awards labor in the same way that traditional markets award capital.
			- A value market incentivies all participants into a virtuous cycle of reinvestment into the market.  
			- Just as with capital investments these labor investments provide the resources needed to grow the market.
			- And this ensures that future value obtained from the value market is then owned and credited back to the participants that performed the labor which grew the market in the first place.
			- Since unicoin is non-transferrable only redeemable, it ensure that existing capital has no way to "buy" its way into the market, the only way to obtain unicoin is through your own personal participation and contributor or consumer within the market.

		- In a way that only 

		- to reinvest as much of their earnings as they can afford back into the market.

		-  into the market and thus growing the market.  but instead of some capital owner getting rich off of all of this hard work, only the participants within the market have access to this

##### --- THE BIG MONEY BACK DOOR ---

		Seriously?!?  WTF?!?  The entire raison d'etre for value markets is to KEEP BIG MONEY OUT!
		So why then would we explictly put a back door in for big money??  And what they F would we be so public about it???

		To answer the first question:  This value market may not be a capital market on the inside, but this market must win in the capital market that lives on the outside.  And in the capital market that lives on the outside, it is not always the most virtuous and most efficient that wins.  Often it is the most connected and well positioned that wins.  And what gets one connected and well positioned?  Money.  Big Money.  So simply put, in order for our value market's products to win in the larger capital markets in which they ultimately live, sometimes one will need to wheel and deal with existing power brokers in order to get ones products into the correct places.  So we need a back door where we can give access, control, and ownership to external players that otherwise would be excluded from these markets.  When in hell one must on occasion deal with the devil.

		To answer the second question:  The reason we are so explicit about this backdoor access method is we know we ARE dealing with the devil here.  If the wrong deal is struck we are giving long lasting access and control to powerful interests outside of the market.  This is a deal with the devil, so it must be executed with great care.  Still we cannot adopt the purists view that no such money or not such partnering is ever allowed.  If we do this we relegate our marketplace only operate in areas of lower concern for big money... (e.g. areas with low profit potential.)  But this greatly limits the impact our market can have. 

		No, the marketplace must partner with powerful allies---allies that are going to want access, control, or ownership in return, not for work they did within the market, but rather for the benefits their existing capital, positioning, and power can bring to the marketplace businesses.  This is just the way that the existing capital system works.

		So we allow these power deals, but we manage them in a very explicit, visible, and carefully vetted way.

		Here is an outline of the process of developing such a back door deal:

		1. The lifetime costs and benefits of any such deals is first assessed by the store fronts or the market participant that want to bring the partner into the market.
		2. The terms of this deal as well as the analysis of the costs and benefits of this deal are then delivered to the fund for a deeper and more careful analysis.  After all it will be largely be the fund whose future returns are both positively and negatively affected by such a back door arrangment.  They have significant interest in getting this right.  Don't give away more than is needed, but do give away what is needed to move the market as a whole forward. They have both the resources and reason to get this choice right from a marketplace profit point of view.
		3. If the fund approves of the deal finally it is passed to the ethics board for approval.  The ethics board is going to take the financial analysis as provided by the fund mostly at face value.  The question that they ethics board asks is whether the deal in some way damages the larger mission of the marketplace.  To a first approximation the mission of the marketplace is to maximize value transfer which is largely (but not completely) aligned with the maximizing of profits which the fund will be focused on.  The ethics board is simply looking for reasons why the deal would do signficant damage to other considerations which the fund does not have primary concern for.
		4. Since the fund represents the interests of all existing and previous contributors, and becuase it has ownership of the assets that are affected by such a deal, it is the final signer for any such deal.



		SHARDS -- SEPARATED MARKETS
		- SUB MARKET -- In case that an investor or a product owner is only willing to join the market place in the case that they retain some defined fraction of what they bring, a shard or sub-market may be created.
		- SEPARATED RULES & INVESTMENTS -- To a degree agreed by the overall fund this shard, both sub fund may segregate both purchase profits component profits
		- SUB FUND -- The IP from this shard is compensated according to the rules 




		Typical shard agreement:
		- x% of top-line revenue is given to the 
		- A community and plain version of the software is maintained

		- GROWS BUSINESS -- The fund spends this income to further grow its business.
		- INVESTS -- The fund invests excess USD with the bank.
		- DIVIDENDS -- Over time the fund provides dividends denominated in USD to it share holders.
		- 100% PRODUCER OWNED -- The only way to obtain fund shares is in exchange for unicoin earned by value transfer,

##### -- details -- 

		 the market fed and 


		THE FUND -- The fund is an investment fund that owns a stake in some marketplace fronts.
		- Shares in the fund are bought and sold in unicoin.
		- The fund maintains a market buying and selling shares of the fund for unicoin
		- The fund recieve USD from its marketplace fronts and converts this for holding into unicoin
		- 15% of the shares of the fund are given to the founders, in exchange for setup and for all inital IP 
		provided during the first two years.
		- Remaining shares are sold of on a fixed schedule during the first 20 years with weighting towards the first years.

		THE BANK -- The bank is used to manage USD denominated assets.
		- USD-denominated assets (e.g. mutual funds) are held by a traditional investment company (e.g. Vanguard)
		- The FED maintains a USD balance with the bank, and the bank sets a very modest risk-free rate of return for the FED
		- UNICOIN investors may buy leveraged risk with the bank as an interesting optimzation.

		FED -- The FED maintains a market for unicoin
		- The fed maintains a market for unicoin.
		- It will BUY UNICOIN from any holder and provide USD in exchange
		- It will SELL UNICOIN but only to THE FUND in exchange for USD
			(the fund may not transfer those coins except for the buying and selling of fund shares)
		- UNICOIN price maintenance.
		- The FED has several mechanisms it uses to maintain the stability of UNICOIN.
		- UNICOIN PURCHASING
			- The FED can print more UNICOIN in exchange for USD and keep the USD to back the currency 
		- UNICOIN REDEMPTIONS
			- FLOAT - The FED maintains a float of USD. Float is used in cases where USD redemptions exceed purchasing.
			- BASKET - The FED may invest its USD float into a basket of low-risk, USD-denominated assets for return.
			- LOANS - The FED maintains a line of credit based on subscription invoices from the fund.
				The Fund agrees to make a certain percentage of its invoices available as colleral.
		- STABILITY - The FED adjusts the supply of UNICOIN over time in order to maintain a modest, smoothly appreciating UNICOIN-USD exchange rate.
			- The FED has a steady flow of USD in from Fund subscriptions for handling redemptions
			- The FED has has invoice-backed USD loans for spikes in redemption rates
			- The FED can print more UNICOIN in exchanage for USD anytime the fund has incoming money.
			- The FED keeps USD off its books by transferring it to the bank for holding.
			- The FED looks at the appreciation rate of FUND shares measured in USD and sets its target appreciation rate comefortably below this rate.
		- MECHANICAL - The execution of the Fed is entirely drive by a simple fixed algorithm

		COIN VALUE
		- A conservative measure of UNICOIN value can be derived by dividing the transparently known number of coins by the transparently known value of all assets held by the bank.
		- The value is likely to be higher than this however since there is no method to purchase these coins, they can only be earned within the market place, and they are the only ways to invest in the FUND.



		FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM
		- Assuming that the total value being generated by the system is increasing over time it will strongly reward contributors that keep their coins in the FUND, or simply held in unicoin.  since they are the only ones who can purchase shares in the fund.  (outside investors cannot!)

		FRACTAL NATURE

		- 

##### --- DD CREDIT ACCOUNTING ---

		**COMPONENT DATA**
		- **CONTRIBUTION** -- One view of the entire marketplace is simply a large collection of _**contributions**_ -- intellectual property that has been licenced to the marketplace.
		- **CONTRIBUTOR** -- Each contribution is provided by a participant called the _**contributor**_ of this contribution.
		- **COMPONENT** -- Contributions are organized into _**components**_, indeed each contribution accepted into a component will alter that component yielding a new verion of the component.  (Think of a component as being a software component and a contribution is a pull request on that component.)
		- **VERSION** -- At any given moment in time the marketplace will have a specific _**version**_ of each of its component.
		- **DEPENDENCY** -- Each version of each component explicitly enumerates its _**dependencies**_ -- the list of sub-component upon which it depends.
		- **DEPENDENCY DAG (DD)** -- The graph of these component dependancies may not have any cycles in it -- it is not legal for a component to recursively depend upon itself.  Thus the graph of dependencies between components is a directed acylic graph (DAG) and is called the _**dependency DAG (DD)**_.
		- **FRONT** -- The top nodes in the DD are called "store fronts" or just fronts, no component depends upon these, instead these components are directly "sold" to consumers.
		- **COMPONENT TREE** -- For comprehensibilty and management components are organized into trees where the internal nodes are components whose contributions just add or remove subcomponents.


		**COMPONENT MAINTENANCE**      (NEEDS REWRITE AND FINISHING)
		- **MAINTAINER** -- Each component within the market is controlled by a specific market participant called its _**maintainer**_.
		- **CONTROLLER'S DUTY** -- The primary responsiblity of a component's controller is to best manange the component and compoenent potential contribution's in a way that best serves interest's of the entire market.
		- **WIN-WIN COLLABORATIVE** -- The expectation and demand of the market is that controllers serve the goals of the market as a whole, if they do not serve these ends there are many remedies available to the market.  But as a first remedy discussion and agreement is attempted to achieve consensus on collaborative win-win ways forward regarding any dispute.  (see 'remedies' for discussion of the range of more coercive solutions to this issue.)
		- **CONTRIBUTIONS** -- In the end, the controller specifies an ordered sequence of contributions that were each accepted at a specified moment in time (think 'pull request').  These contributions fully specify the state of any given component at any given moment in time.
		- **DELEGATION** -- A component controller may delegate all of their component related abilties, including the ultimate control of the component itself.


		**DEPENDENENT CRITICALITY**
			What is the criticality of the subcomponent within the context of the importing component that depends upon it?
			**DC1**	--	subcomponent has incidental value
			**DC2**	--	subcomponent is clearly additive but not essential to the core functioning
			**DC3**	--	subcomponent (or another like it) is essential to the core functioning of the component
			**DC4**	--	subcomponent's design is transformational to the core functioning of this component

			By default all dependents are DC3.  The author of a component can choose to "downgrade" dependencies that they feel are not essential to the component, and in cases where a subcomponent design really transformedly improves their component's capabilies this can be indicated by DC4.  (The system works pretty well if all dependents are simply listed as DC3)


		CONTRIBUTION PROPERTIES
			SIZE	-- An automatically computed measure of the effort required by the contributor to author this contribution.
			NOVELTY -- A one-time indication of the 
						IMPLEMENTATIONALLY NEW, CONCEPTIONALLY NEW
			RECENCY	-- The recency of a contribution is a measure of how much time and activity have occurred on the component. 


		JURISDICTIONS
		- JURISDICTION -- At the top of the component tree are a list of different "jurisdictions".  Each of these jurisdictions has its own rules and laws for how components are managed and compensated.
		- ONLY ONE -- Initially there will only be one jurisdiction, but as the needs for different sub-communities differ there may be need for different jurisdictions to handle compensation or other aspects of the market place differently.


		SPECIAL CASES
		- FORKS -- 
		- IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES 



		=== **ALGORITHM** ===

		**CONTRIBUTION CREDIT ASSIGNMENT**
		- At each moment in time the entire history of contributions for a component are considered for assignment of credit to its current state and value.
		- Each contribution for a given component is given a contribution score and these contribution scores are scaled to sum to 1.0
		- A defined contribution score is also automatically assigned to each maintainer that was active during 

		**COMPONENT CREDIT ASSIGNMENT**
		- Each USD purchase is made to a specific store front at a specific moment in time.  Each purchase is immediately converted to unicoin and credited to that front (which is a root node in the component dependency DAG).
		- The recursive requirements for this front at that moment in time are derived from the DD
		- For each required component a contribution score is computed and then are collectively scaled so their sum is 1.0

		**PARTICIPANT CREDIT ASSIGNMENT**
		- For each purchase made at a store front, the unicoin generated is partitioned into a set of contributing parts:
				PART(i, j) = SCALED_COMPONENT_SCORE(i) * SCALED_CONTRIBUTION_SCORE(i, j) * PURCHASE_AMOUNT
		- The sum of these parts will equal the original equal the original purchase amount and since each part is associated with a single contribution (pull request) it is also associated with a specific contributing market participant.
		- Thus these part designations are simply added to the unicoin account balanced for each of the relevant participants.

#### === JURSIDICTIONAL CONTROL SYSTEM ===
##### --- THE MARKETPLACE MANAGEMENT BOARD ---

		The marketplace has been specifically constructed in order to best align individual interests with the larger objectives of maximizing value transfered, enabling human thriving, and generally being a force for good within society.

		Nonetheless no codified system can account for all possible interactions or exceptional cases.  

		We believe the marketplace mechanim acheives substantial improvements in the alignment of individual interests with many societal goods relative to traditional or many other market mechanisms.  In particular we belive it remedies several key gaps that exist with the currently dominate captial market systems.  So hooray, if we are right about these advancements!  

		Still, even if we are correct with this rosy assessment, we can already enumerate specific ways in which this new market mechanism falls short of fully realizing it objective of enabling human thriving.  (We include one such example below.) Further even if one could adapt the market to cover all of these second order and third order effects, there would always be yet additional completely unexpected cases where the marketplace fails to live up to its very lofty objectives.

		It is for these reasons that the marketplace ethics board exists.  This board is an "escape hatch" for the mechanisms of the marketplace, an explicit human-in-the-loop check on that the emergent behaviors that the sytem are driving are not far from alignment with the stated objective of the market.  This board is comprised of participants from the marketplace, but explicitly strives to be independent of any benefits that might accrue to those specific individuals and instead is constructed to try to assess the appropriateness of the behavior of the system, and of specific optional available to the marketplace in light of the stated goals of the marketplace.

		OPERATIONS
		- COURT SYSTEM -- The ethics board is a kind of court system that is invoked to determine the appropriateness of specific market-wide actions that could easily have counter productive effects.
		- ENUMERATED CHECKS -- The market mechanism has an enumerate list of actions which require ethics board approval.  As matter of course these actions require an explicit "ok" before proceeding.
		- PROSECUITORIAL CHECKS -- In addition, the market has an explicit list of categories of inappropriate action which a specially empowered prosecutors office uses to look for cases where the behavior of the system is not appropriate.
		- PARTICIPANT SUIT -- Finally participants may "sue" arguing that the system or individuals within the system are operating in appropriately.
		- ARMS LENGTH -- as much as possible the ethics board strives to utilitze participants that are at arms lenght from any advantage or disadvantage they might acrue related to the question being addressed.
		- INTEGRITY -- The entire marketplace is relant on the members of the ethics board being honest in the execution of their duties.  (Our experience is that appropriately chosen individuals, who are at arms length from issues at hand can be trusted to maintain integrity better than any other method that we have uncovered to date.  It is the best we got, and quite often, when set up well, it can be quite good.)



		For concretness we provide a single example here:  After a period of time the system will generate significant value in the IP contained within the market; importantly the participants be the owners of this value ensuring they are fairly compensated.  But the shares of that fund which are available to future contributors is an unconstrained aspect of the system. If current owners pinched this down too far it would precude future workers and kill the system as well as their value.  Still they might be encouraged to just SQEEZED future contributor in order to get an outsized reward for their early contribution.

#### === TOPICS ===
##### --- SIMPLE MECHANSIM - V1.0 ---

		**THE FED V1.0**
		- The fed seeks to maintain a 1-to-1 tether between USD and unicoin.
		- It transparently maintains a USD balance with the bank equal to the number of unicoin in circulation.
		- It creates new unicoin when requested to convert USD into unicoin, and deposits provided usd with the bank
		- Conversely it "burns" existing unicoin when they are provided for redemption and directs the bank to transfer USD to the appropriate market participant.

		**THE BANK V1.0**
		- An existing investment bank (like vanguard or morgan stanley) serves as the holding bank for USD assets.
		- Contractually all USD transfers must fit within withdraw limits and requires approval of both FED and ethics board
		- All USD transfers (initially) are publically shared with all market participants in aggregate forms.
		- The simplest version of the bank only maintains FED assets
		- And the simplest bank only utilizes low-interest, risk-free vehicles thus ensuring that the fed always has the required USD in order to meet its 1-to-1 tethering obligation.

		**THE FUND V1.0**
		- Contributors are encouraged to invest their earnings back into the system for larger returns later.
		- Contributors do this using their unicoin earnings to purchasing shares of the fund.
		- The fund's share price has a simple geometrically increasing purchase price.
			(this gives modest incentive for those earlier in the market's history to contribute, over time this advantage for earlier investments becomes less)
		- The total number of shares in the fund increase or decrease as purchases and redemptions are made.
		- The fund invests its unicoin back into the market thru a variety of bounties, incentives, external marketing etc.
		- In all cases some fraction of the benefits of these actions are paid back to the fund.
		- The oversight board must approve of the different pay-back schemes developed for the fund.
		- (Notice:  The fund is 100% owned by the contributors, so even if we get the payback rules wrong the damage is minimal since it is more/less direct money to the contributors as pay but then less/more indirect monies paid since they are the owners of the fund.)
		- A weighted vote among all share holders in the fund are used to select the three board memebers for the fund.
		- At any time share holders may vote for a new selection of board memebers (once 30% of share holders indicate a desire for a new vote, or on each 2 year boundary)

		**PAYMENT PROCESSING V1.0**
		- Payments are taken in external currencies and converted into unicoin.
		- A flat tax is take on these purchase and put towards specific marketplace needs:
			- marketplace execution costs (server costs, personnel costs), 
			- fund tax (provides additional resources to grow the marketplace)
			- founder tax (a fixed 10% or 15% is granted to the founder of the marketplace; 
				this is phased out after as millions are collected)
		- Remaining unicoin is distributed according to the DD credit accounting algorithms
		- Resulting unicoin amounts are added to each participant's wallet according to credits due.
		- Participants may manually manage their unicoin account, or set their account to automatically sweep into the fund, or may set period payments in USD back to an external account.

		**JURISDICTION V1.0**
		- For simplicity the entire market will begin under a single jurisdiction.
		- This jurisdiction contains all the rules and procedures the govern the execution of the marketplace.
		- These are mostly a set of rules of conduct written in natural language.
		- But they also include formulas and algorithms used to drive the behavior of the marketplace itself.
		- The fund represents the "will of the contributors" and it also represents those with the most "skin in the game" thus the funds governing body acts as the marketplace's legislative branch, it reviews and edits the jurisdictional rules which govern the execution of the market place.

		**OVERSIGHT BOARD V1.0**
		- All participants (both contributors and consumers) vote on the oversight board membership.
		- Marketplace culture dictates the participants vote their conscience for this vote.
		- Quite explicitly board members are in no way intended to act or indicate favoritism towards any particular group.
		- Such behavior is ethically bared by the jursidictional rules of the market itself, and can be grounds for excluding an individual from being considered for the board.
		- The board is intended to operate like a "supreme court" for the market.  It interprets the rules of the market place and make specific determinations based on those rules.






		BANK 2.0
		- A more complex banking system allows for different participants to differentially share in the risk / reward tradeoff around the held USD.
		- Both the fund as well as market contributors can stake either their future component earnings or USD held as collateral in return for a leveraged returns from the invested USD
		- SIMPLE EXAMPLE:  
			- Assume the FED needs to store $1000 USD in the bank.
			- A participant might stake $500 USD in order to gain the excess returns on that $1000
			- The bank then invests the $1000 in a broad-based equity mutual fund and uses the additional $500 as security in case the mutual fund drops below $1000, in that case the participants money is used to cover the difference, and the participant must contribute addional moneies to keep the position open.  
			- In the case that the market increases then the addional monies accrue to the particpants $500 account.  In this way the participant has leverage access to the USD equities market.
		- SECOND EXAMPLE:
			- The fund has many sources of recuring revenue from the many compoents that it has a stake in.
			- It may use future earning from these to secure invoice loans, or just provide "naked" collateral to the bank in exchange for access to leverage earning from the housed USD.
			- In some cases this could result in temporary limits on the FEDs ability to redeem unicoin.  Assuming the marketplace is still functioning and still bringing in profits, then eventually it will have the income to cover any run on the bank in selling off massive numbers of unicoin.
			- The ethics board would need to weigh the risks of breaking the 1-to-1 peg of the unicoin tether against the advantages of allowing the fund to use future earnings as collateral to provide it access to leveraged returns from the USD equities market.
			- Likely if the percent of the unicoin tethered assets leveraged by the fund remained not too close to 100% then the risks that a run on unicoin redemptions not being covered could be contained.  Further if future earning from the fund assets was strong and fairly assured, then the risks to participants seeking redemption could be significantly mitigated since the fund would be very likely over time to has the resources to fully cover the 1-to-1 tethering peg.

		- allows both the fund as well as market contributors to take on part of the risks associated with 

		- bank will allow market contributors to put USD collateral or future component earnings at risk in order to gain leveraged access to

##### --- ASPECTS OF HUMAN THRIVING ---

		We are interesting in developing a marketplace (and ultimately a society) that supports human thriving.
		It is helpful to provide more detailed list of properties that are important for such a thriving.
		These properties generally stand on their own, they are claims about what is important for human thriving.

		We list these up front before the details of value markets since those details were choses specifically to support these properties.  Still we recomment skimming this list for now, as most properties will seem like motherhood and apple-pie  -- obviously true and good, but rather disconnected from any practical plan for action.  What gives them weight is when one sees how they are related to the workings of the value market itself.



		**INDIVIDUALIZED** -- A single person's mission is the meaning for that person's life, so even if this mission is supported by others with related missions, is it ideal if the fruits of this mission are somehow personalized to each individual.

		**VOLUNTARY** -- A mission freely selected by an individual is far superior to one forced upon them, when considering it as a source of meaning for their lives.  In the latter case they are merely following orders or the ordering of a system which they did not create or nor do they control.

		**CREDIT** -- The most potent missions are those taken on without any consideration from the individual regarding the credit they might receive as an individual.  Still, lesser but quite valuable missions are done in part or in whole for the credit one expects to receive.  Receiving credit "as one deserves" is a valuable and important stepping stone motivator.  Further having others "unfairly getting credit" due to an individual is a potent DEMOTIVATOR to be avoided.

		**COMPENSATION** -- Likewise the most potent missions are those not tied to individual compensation.  Still lesser but quite significant meaning can be tied to a societal mission done in part for personal compensation.  Both as a stepping stone towards the more selfless soceital aspects of the missions, and well as serving the practical physical needs of the individual.

		**CONSEQUENCE** -- Concrete conditional consequences must flow both to the individual and to the missions larger target if that it is to be a satisfying mission.  Winning has no meaning is loosing is not a real possibility.  Thus shielding the individual from failure is itself creating a second kind of failure.

		**PERSONAL AUTONOMY** -- Many missions are collaborative and large, Thus are significantly constrainted by others and things outside of an individual's control.  Nontheless in order for a mission to give purpose to a person's life there must also be a significant autonomy in its execution.  The individual must feel important aspects of the mission results from choices they made, which could have been made otherwise.

		**VOTING WITH ONES HANDS** -- The modern societal context affords an inscruitably complex, nearly limitless, space of ways an individual might use one's efforts (one's hands) to contribute: write a song, a story, or software.  Ah but which song? what does the software do?  for what audience?  There is great value in letting the individual choose these things.  It significantly adds to the autonomy of their efforts.  Further, since we hardly know the larger consequenes of any given choice, having many individuals guessing is far better than some top-down process for choosing.

		**WISDOM OF THE CROWD** -- This approach has the advantage that it is distributed decision making system.  It scales well as the number of individual swells since it does not try to a priori connect actions across multiple actors.  It also leverages the "wisdom of the crowd" in the sense that a path will be explored if any one individual is sufficiently motivated and beliving in that path.  Top down planning can easily be blinded to many alternatives specifcially because fewer are driving the planning.  [[this one is out of place???]]

		**NATURAL CONSEQUENCES** -- While expending effort may be rewarded with recognition and compensation, the natural consequences of an individual's effort resulting in societal value should be an increase in recognition and compensation for that individual.

		-**A PRIORI CLARITY** -- In consideration of the weight of these choices that each individual's must make, society endevors to provide each individual with the greatest possible clarity regarding the value of the possible efforts they might make.  In particular information should not be hidden or restricted in a way that might limit or obscure possible individual action.  We encourage each to strike out into the night to gain glory or suffer consequence, but always equipped with the best flash lights and maps we can furnish.

		-**A POSTORI FEEDBACK** -- In consideration of immense complexity of choosing, society endevors to provide the most timely and valuable feedback at the smallest possible grain sizes for each individual's action.  Costs of dead ends are best contained not by stopping the attempt, but providing timely feedback on aparent progress.

		-**VOTING WITH ONES FEET** -- Not only do we empower each individual to choose how they expend their efforts, but we empower each to choose which other's efforts they enjoy as a consumer, and which other's efforts they will build upon as a contributor.  This increases the autonomy afforded to each individual.  Additionally this freedom affords a finer-grained measure of value.  There is nothing like allowing an individual to freely choose between alternatives as a way to measure of the value of those alternatives.

		-**GOOD COMPETITION VERSES BAD COMPETITION** -- 
		There are two ways to cause A to be greater than B.  Either you increase A or you decrease B.  Likewise there are two ways of out competing another, either you improve your performance in some way, or you systematicaly limit the performance of all others.  We refer to the first kind of competition as "good" competition since it aligns with the idea of having a mission to produce some output of benefit to the larger society.  While we refer to the second approach as "bad" competition since ones energies are focused on identifying and gaining sole control over a systematic way to limit the performance of all others relative to oneself.  Both can be legal, and both are "winning" strategies in a capital market, but only the first one is consistent with human thriving -- with having a mission to improve something larger than oneself.  (In the capital markets section we see that not only do capital markets not favor good competition, but worse yet the bad version is often more effective and thus often preferred.  Quite a tragedy when thinking about human thriving.)

		OBSTRUCTIONIST -- 

		-**COERCIVE CONTROL** -- _**Coercive Control**_ is particular form of bad competition where a participant leverages some control they possess over the actions of others in order to reap reward from their actions or limit their actions in a way that magnifies their own rewards.  Coercive control is measured counterfactually, supposing the coercing participant was never part of society, does their non-participation now open rewards for other that were blocked by their participation?  Further there are alternate arragements which lower coercion and increase total societal value transferred?  Not all cases where others would counterfactually benefit constitue a case of coercive control.  Assessing coercive control is complex especially in borderline cases.  Still egregious cases of coercive control are unmistakable, clearly identifiable, and very damaging to human thriving.

		Simplified solution to coercive control:  Provide participants credit and compensation for what they have done in the past, but disallow "ownership" of the future use of those contributions.


		HYPER SLICING -- GRAIN SIZE -- As much as possible society seeks to 



		_
###### -- COERCIVE CONTROL DISCUSSION --

		Network effects are an example of coercive control.

		The owner of a network should get "good competition" credit for having brought this valuable new network into being.
		At the same time, the definition of a network effect is that mere usage of the network streghtens the value of the network.  This streghtening is not due to the creator of the network, but rather due to the many users of the network.  The are the rightful beneficiaries of that increase in value.  Yet in capital systems with current IP laws typically it is the creator of that network which reaps the rewards generated by the actions of others.




		The human thriving approach toward management of coercive control.
		-1-	Identify the value of the contribution that created the potential for coercive control.
		Likely this contribution has significant value for society, that is what allowed its creator to gain their coercive control.  We wish to assess and compensate this value fairly.  This can be done simply by 
		- post-hoc measurement of the usage of this contribution
		- incite measurement -- a more challenging measurement assesses how inciteful the contribution is.  Was this idea already existing in other places and other forms?  if not was the possibility or need for this incite newly formed and this participant was just the first to realize it?  Or did the possibility exist laying unconsidered for years or decades?  By default we assume all new contributions are inciteful and credit them in that way.  But when it is clear this idea not new, or it "would have soon been discovered" its value is reduced






		COERSION MANAGEMENT MECHANSIM

		The simplest solution is one where the maintainer of a component fork is not actively contributing to that fork, but instead is simply testing and choosing among contributions that have no connection to.

		The next level is one where they and others contribute but there are no coercion complaints, nor 


		_
##### --- REHABILITATING CAPITAL MARKETS --- 

		Since the world presently runs on capital markets it is helpful to identify aspects of those markets which are consistent and supportive of human thriving, and which are detrimental to human thriving.  This provides us something of a roadmap for the things we wish to retain verses things we hope to change and we develop a new market mechanism.

		Has several key attributes that we hope to retain

		- DISTRIBUTED -- Distributed decision making
		- SCALABLE -- scalable, distributed decision making system
		- EFFICIENT -- Tends to focus capital in places where it will make the largest impact.
		- FAIR -- 
		- INDIVIDUALISTIC -- 

		but is also broken in critical devistating way -- 
		- HOW -- It incentivises bad competition.  Indeed in the knowlege economy it generally incentivies bad competition over good competition since it can likely generate a much more durable moat.
		- DEMORALIZING -- demoralizing because it incentivies bad competition
		- INEFFICIENT -- 


		_
###### -- Good vs Bad Competition --
		This may be legal, and it will cause one to out compete the others, but not in a way that is beneficial to larger society.  The more beneficial path in the second case would be avoid any limiting of others, this would yeild better outcomes for society as a whole, but would no longer ensure that you would repeatedly be the winner in the competition.

		As long as one stays within the letter of the law, capital markets don't favor one kind of competiton over the other, either one can causes one to outcompete others is favored.  But human thriving definitely does favor good competition.  Bad competition can certainly occupy ones life, but it does not lead to human thriving since the focus is ensuring that one never looses the ability to limit others ability to benefit society.

		Worse yet, in a capital market it is not enough to outcompete others on one occasion, rather one must arrange for some form a "sustainable differentiation" -- some systematic way to ensure that you have a method to repeatedly outcompete all others no matter what.  There are cases where one can arrange to some how be and magically REMAIN so much better than ALL others that it becomes a sustainable differentiation, but this is quite rare... whatever you can do, they could potentially copy.  No often the path to strong sustainable differentiation is to identify some absolutely critical ingredient to success and then arrage that you will have exclusive access/control over this ingredient.  If you can do this in a strong way, then you have one of the few truely sustainable differentiations.  Almost all massive companies today are built around such a blocking strategy.  




		It is the holy grail of capital markets, just look at how prolifically VCs will throw  huge cash at busiensses that even have a chance at coming to control one of these strategic blockers.

		But this is all bad competition!  It is so lucrative in capital markets that we have normalized it to the extent that we pretend it is a respectable goal to have, but it is not.  One is spending ones life ensuring that others cannot get a foothold on the hill that you are commanding where you can 



		different relative to ALL others that causes you to repeatedly win the competition.


		repeately outcompete others

		_
##### --- MARKET RECIPROCITY ---
		MARKET RECIPROCITY -- Market Reciprocity is a collection of principles and mechansims that facilitate interoperability between independently managed markets/ecosystems to allow value-market benefits to multiple ecosystems in a way that incentivises participation both at the individual level and the marketplace level.

		The core idea behind a value-market is the idea that banding greater numbers of producers and greater numbers of consumers into a larger market drives value by increasing super linear benefits obtained when greater numbers of producers coordinate to service greater numbers of consumers.  It is thus natural (and quite important) that independently developed markets with similar goals are somehow combined in order that the super-linear benefits span the communities, rather than being divided by them.

		For many practical reasons it is unlikely and undesirable to try to force all value-market benefits to stem from a single marketplace developed by a single organizing entity.  Humanity is too large and too diverse for this to be practical and workable.

		Fortunately we can outline a minimal set of principles which allow for the conbining of benefits from multiple such market ecosystems w/o trying to force all participants into a single market.


		These four genearlized precepts underly the notion of value-market itself.  In order for a market to gain benefit from the maximizing of value transfers it must adhere to these principles.  These also form the bedrock upon with reciprocity is built:
		1. SHARING OF IP -- It is sub-optimal for a market to incentivise duplication of intellectual property
			Thus the only way to eliminate this waste is to make all intellectual property open and available.  To ensure this the market needs to:
			1a. (approximately) ensure that the compensation one obtains from simply copying some IP is the same as the compensation one obtains from rebuilding it.
			1b.	one much also ensure that the value obtained from some IP is not smaller than the value one can obtain by keeping that IP outside the marketplace.
	
		2. NON-COERCIVE -- Both producers and consumers freely participate in market
		 3.	COMPENSATION -- Value-market style compensation mechansim
			 NOT PRICED -- Not build upon restricting the usage of the product.
			 PRODUCER INCENTING -- Best action for producers is to place products into the market

Truths

THE PROBLEM - The value obtained by consumer in the creator-economy far exceeds payment provided to its creators.  Chief among the problems created by this reality is the collapse of the system itself:  Huge value is lost to consumers because would-be creators exit the system, that creators that remain are greatly penalized by a system that does not pay them what they are worth.


THE CAUSE - A special kind of "creator economy" network effect is inherent to consumed content which causes it to operate very differently than other traditional market goods.  As with transitional goods, value accrues to the recipient of created content as it is consumed.  But paradoxically value *also* accrues to the creator of the content each time the content is consumed.  This second factor makes the traditional licensing/purchasing model wholly in appropriate for such content, resulting in many market contortions as creators and groups of creators struggle to adapt a misaligned mechanism to the realities of the product they are selling.




PROPER MARKET BEHAVIOR - So if, the traditional market mechanism is ideal for traditional goods since it tends to maximize collective utility of those goods.  What properties would a "creator economy" mechanism have?
- 100% content availability.
- maximal non-coercive creator-consumer collective utility.

KEY POINTS
- Mkt Objective: Support flourishing by Maximizing Token Flow from retailers to producers
	- Not a chairity; No Entitlements; Not a government; max cohesion; max diversity.
- Contributions: Participants may choose to contribute some IP to the market.  
	- Only way to get compensated by the market.
	- At a minimum this provides an irrevocable licence to the market for the IP.
	- It may be exclusive.  be open source.  be full assignment of ownership. be licenced outside mkt
	- Voluntary: Participants choose when, how, and how long they participate in the market
		- may stop contributing newer version of IP to the market.
- Simple Post Hoc Payment mechanism as basis
	- Weighted Voting.  Node's voting weight is proportional to the coin flow at node.
	- Credit assignment.  Each node assigns 'credit' to it dependents (as assessed by the node)
	- Coin flow is a monotonic function of incoming credits
- Homeostasis
	- Permissive/Optomistic -- System built on assumption of good will, openness, profiting is good and then has several mechanisms to patch up places where these assumptions are wrong.
	- Extra Rules -- Participants add area specific constraints to limit gaming & other damaging behaviors.
	- Punishments -- Courts will mete out specific punishments when generalized
