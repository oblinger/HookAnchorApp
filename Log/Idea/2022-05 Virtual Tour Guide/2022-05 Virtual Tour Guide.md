# Google Search + Google Lens: Contextualized Influencer Content Platform

## **Problem**
1. End users; especially the younger generation, increasingly start their search on social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram instead of Google Search or Map. They prefer to get their content from creators they trust and in more visually-rich narrative form.
2. Content creators flock to these ecosystems that allow them to grow, manage and monetize their followings.
3. Google Search structure does not make it clear on where 3rd party content is hosted on Search because it's designed to crawl from upstream contents. The experience also does not drive content creator's relationship with their followers; thus creators go elsewhere.

**Objective**
Create an environment to attract content creators to incorporate their contents directly in the Google
Search ecosystem that allows them to provide highly contextualized content and grow followers.

**Google Search Current Strengths**
- **Universality of Google Search** -- Many users will consider a Google search as the 1st option for a broad range of topics. This affords a content creator the potential hook to grab new followers.
- **Query Specificity** -- Typical search queries provide specificity that could drive hyper targeted retrieval of creator content.
- **Image Library** -- Google's vast image library provides superiority in using environmental images as a potential index into creator content.

**Solution**
Use Google Search + Lens to provide a unique/powerful platform to support the growth/management of a content creator's community while bringing location-contextualized content to their followers. Similar solutions could also work by collaborating with other PAs (e.g. Map).

Content creators need a 'garden' where they can corral their followers. This can be added to search by having the click-through on a snippet-info box go to a specialized creator-only search area. Subsequent searches would be contextualized by location, by search terms, and according to the influencers followed.

Using Lens' ability to facilitate hyper-local search will enable the creator's narrative content to be presented at the exact right moment. Existing social networks support growing followers, but have no support for contextually indexed content. Google Search could leap-frog them in this area.

There are many user personas we can come up with the targeted solution for. The user persona I would
like to address to illustrate the use case is as below:

| Name | Who am I            | My Statement                  | What are my goals          | Frustrations                 |
