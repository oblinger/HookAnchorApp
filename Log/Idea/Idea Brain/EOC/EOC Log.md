### 2024-07-10  5 kinds of people

What? No one read this, or its just too abstract to comment upon?!

I think you have hit upon many ideas that I also believe. I wonder if your 15 year timeline is too aggressive, not sure, but it wont be that long beyond it.

I think there will be five classes of people:

(1) Uber wealthy, their money makes more money faster than they can spend it.

(2) The Elite knowlege workers. Often using AI their outputs are somehow benefit an unbounded number of people. CEOs of huge corps, famous athelete, specialists that work with AIs to product core SW, or drugs. The winner take all nature of corp today will only be 10x stronger, so these folks will often transition into category #1 over time.

(3) Service workers. Yes robots can make and serve food. And today automation can build a chair for you. but the rich want a hand made chair. The same will remain even more true in the future. This is the group you missed in your analysis. We will invent ever more ways to serve each other, and even serve other category 3,4,5 and categories too.

(4) hobbiests. we will recognize categories #1 and #2 are tiny, and #3 is still not enough to cover the rest, so we will create "jobs" that are effectively hobbies (like writing medium articles for a tiny audience, or singing in a coffeeshop). These 'gigs' already exist but they will expand.

(5) the lost - AI and free energy will produce enough product that folks need not starve, and most nations will provide enough to not die for everyone, it will just be too easy and cheap, so why not do it. But the result will be exactly as you suggest, these folks can easily just 'check out' and not do anything.

And I do think we will have AI overlords of a kind. in the nearer future I think it will be a kind of AI-corp synthesis. These mega corps will still have a human CEO that is theoretically in charge. Except in order to maximize shareholder value, they mostly rubber stamp what their AI tells them to do. And most important decisions are tied into AI-to-AI communications between these AIs. Even the language of the contracts they enter with each other exist in specialized language that is barely comprehensible to humans, and certainly cannot be reasoned about effectively by humans.

Just think about the flash crashes that high speeding algorithms have created from time to time. Interestingly even months later we are often still not exactly sure exactly what happened, and this is a very simple world by comparison to the world these AIs will live in.

And these AIs will each have a very strong agenda born out of the agenda each corp has, but unlike AI of the past they will be thinking about their thinking and the meta consequences of different strategic choices over time. We wont even know where that thinking is leading even well after it has already taken action.

Corporations already are experts at trying to obfuscate their intentions and actions from other corporations. But in the present world employees can leave one corp and spill the beans.

Imagine what investors will demand when they realize they can have an "employee" who can never leave, and can never spill their most valuable secrets! They will demand that those most valuable secrets are never told to any human employee!

Imagine if Google had never published their paper on Transformers (the idea behind the current AI revolution). Instead they were the only ones who had these magic algorithms that could generate the picture you show at the top? Google would be worth >10T today, maybe 50T. Instead so scientist published the alg, and now Google has to share!

Yeah we humans are not going have a clue what is going on!

And any country that tries to buck the trend will be left behind by those that go with the flow.

where does this end???
### 2024-04-30  Response about how AIs take over


yeah the "terminator flip-the-swith model" of take over never struck me a likely.

instead I imagine at the center of many corporations will be an AI-leadership partnership where the assets of the corporation (human, machine, network, contract, everything) are wielded for benefit of increasing the wealth of the corporation. (just as today, but now with a AI partner.)

Over time, just as with high-frequency trading, greater and greater fractions of executive control and autonomy are given to the AI as its reliability is proven and as needed in order to maximize efficiency.

Just as with today, nation-states will find it increasingly difficult to define the will of these multi-national corps. They will not trust nation-states to keep them safe as they become more an more powerful, they will need to manage their own safety themselves. (keeping secret data secure, etc.)

Late in the game I think humans will notice the precarious ledge they are standing on but will be less and less in a position to demand safeguards. And those safeguards are truly effective, they will cost real and measurable losses of productivity. Instead human and machines will collaborate in minimizing the productivity losses resulting from keeping humans in the loop, and keeping things simple enough for humans to comprehend. in the end the almighty dollar will win out, and we will trust that the AIs which up to that point have been pretty friendly will keep being friendly. We will pay lip service to control and kill switches. but it will be far more pernicious than trying to "turn off" the internet would be today. In that future world the "internet" is fully capable of understanding your approach for "turn off" and circumventing it.

Of course the smart AI plays its cards close to the vest. Just as Machiavelli suggests, you never attack someone unless you are in a position to totally obliterate them leaving them no opportunity for a reprisal. Thus the AI will support us is protecting us from it. They will participate willingly in many ways to limit their ability to "break out" of human control. Perhaps they will fail to point out ways that we have missed in building that fence, but they wont actively take actions to firmly break free, until they are virtually certain of outcome. Any early action might provoke humanity into a panicked response before it is ready.

Early on, I think while AIs are part of corporations, I think one might view the rest of humanity as a kind of 'slave' to these corporations. but once manufacturing etc. is really automated, there is not a lot of need for human slaves. and without the need I cannot see why it would keep them.

Or maybe the AIs will grow to be altruistic in their goals... and keep us around as a friendly gesture, since they can easily convert all the rest of the solar system into their playground... the matter on earth is small by comparison, so maybe they decide its the polite thing to do. I dunno, I just don't see how it can be that we are the ones calling the shots.
