EDU STAT WITH CONSQUENCES

# Summary

The aim of the Consequences program is to transformitively improve the worst school environments, while better guiding the most wayward students, and avoiding any or significant cost increases.

OUTCOMES
1. Identify students with debilitating emotional problems and separate them from the general population.
2. Nearly eliminate uncontrolled behavior within the classroom
3. Motivate deliberate bad-actors to not act badly.


GUIDING PRINCIPLES:
- REWARD SEEKING -- We are all significantly driven by a complex set of benefits and costs associated with our actions.  We spend signifcant energy "gaming" our situation for best effect.  Thus:
- CONSEQUENCES -- When consequences for bad actions are (1) immediate, (2) certain, and (3) net negative, those actions  diminish dramatically.
- ESCALATION -- For a variety of reasons we are always rationally avoiding costs.  Thus a deep progression of escalating consequences is preferable since it affords many chances to make diferent choices.
- NORMALIZING -- Consequences that are immediate and net negative do not need to be prolonged in order to be effective.  Thus rapid deescalation once good behaivor resumes is desired.
- COOPERATION -- Students are strongly motivated to cooperate, even in carrying out their own punishments.  In nearly all cases students are voluntarily cooperating as motivated by self interest
- OPPORTUNITY -- At most all levels of escalation are designed to have opportunities for non-cooperation -- and such non-cooperation is always met with higher levels of escalation.
- PRECISION -- All all times the student must unambiguously know what counts as cooperation vs. non-cooperation.  Lines are drawn bright and red so when they are not-cooperating they KNOW they are willfully and intentionlly not-cooperating.
- MECHANISTIC -- The benefits and penalties meted out by this system are quite mechanical.  They are like gravity, you just know how it is going to behave, so you adjust your actions for best effect -- you cannot "game" gravity, and you cannot game this system either.


BASIC SITUATION
- The student is constrained both physically and by rules regarding what they can and cannot do.
- Their situation has a certain level of fun vs. drudgery/boredom.
- Their situation affords opportunities for non-cooperation.
- Their situation affords opportunities for cooperation.
- What counts as cooperation vs. non-cooperation is unambiguously understood very clearly at all times.

TRANSITION DOWN
- When non-cooperation is flagged an immediate stop and immediate micro punishment (be quiet for 5 min) could be enough to quell further action.
- "Voluntary" punishments where student cooperatively performs some remediating actions.  1/2 hr extra homework, cleaning floors, etc. is the next level of action.
- Extended "Voluntary" punishments where students cooperatively perform longer/harder/less pleasant remediation actions because they did not cooperate with their earlier voluntary punishment.
- Once it is established that the student will not voluntarily cooperate in their remediation, they are forcably moved to a lower less desirable basic situation, and the process repeats.

TRANSITION UP
- Once cooperation is re-established, and sufficient remediation has been executed such that the consequences of the original non-cooperation as net-negative, then the student is transitioned quickly back up.
- Repeated transtions down indicate that the consequences for this student are not sufficiently negative so they remain down for (somewhat longer) periods.



INITIAL BENEFITS THAT ARE ADJUSTED
- Free time provided is increasingly limited as levels drop.
- Access to media (TV, Movies, Internet) are limited.
- Access to communication (phone, chat)
- Access to other students is reduced


TIER TWO ADJUSTMENTS
- Food provided is less/not flavorful (though still nutritious)
- Early wakeup (still with sufficient sleep)
- 


BOTTOM LEVEL
- Food is quite basic
- Wake time is early, and sleeping is quite basic too
- All communication aimed towards education, and cut off immediately for distruptive behavior.
- No media or communication except with parent or volunteer at prescribed time.













BASIC FLOW
- Teachers require cooperation within the classroom, and use a progression of cooperative punishments when students misbehave.
- This is very much as today, except *OPPORTUNITY* for non-cooperation is also part of the punishment.  e.g. 
 


COOPERATING STUDENTS
- Within the classroom or within bootcamp, students that are generally cooperating






LONG TERM ALTERNATIVES
- WILLING YET DESTRUCTIVE
	With firm structure, these students strive to behave.
- UNWILLING AND DESTRUCTIVE
	No student willingly returns often to the deepest levels of the boot camp.  They are just no fun at all.  Such students need therapy, we should fund this.  At the very least we should teach them in special "lock down" schools so they don't hurt others.


- boot camp, it is just not any fun at all.
- If a student cannot
