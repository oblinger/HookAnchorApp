## Specific Digital Discussion Experiments

| Project | Organizer/Contact | Year | Platform Used | Purpose/Outcome |
|---------|-------------------|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Wellington Alcohol Policy** | Loomio + Wellington City Council<br/>*300 participants* | 2015 | Loomio | 6-week deliberation on alcohol management. Citizens, experts, officials collaborating. Led to policy changes. |
| **Barcelona Participation** | Barcelona City Council<br/>*Decidim development* | 2016-present | Decidim | City-wide participatory budgeting, neighborhood planning. Thousands of participants in ongoing processes. |
| **Pirate Party Democracy** | German/International Pirate Parties | 2009-present | LiquidFeedback | Internal party decision-making using liquid democracy principles. Delegation-based voting. |
| **Madrid Decide Platform** | Madrid City Council<br/>*Contact: decide.madrid.es* | 2015-2019 | Custom platform | Citizen proposals, participatory budgeting. Tens of thousands of participants in municipal decisions. |
| **Estonian Participation** | Estonian Government + CitizenOS | 2014-present | CitizenOS | National e-democracy platform. Citizens initiate policy discussions and petitions. |
| **Occupy Movement Tools** | Various global organizers | 2011-2012 | Multiple platforms | Early experiments in digital democracy, consensus-building. Led to development of many current tools. |

## Contact Strategy for Digital Discussion Groups

### **Most Approachable for Small-Scale Outreach:**
1. **Local Civic Tech Groups** - Open Twin Cities, Chi Hack Night, Civic Tech DC
2. **Platform Cooperatives** - Loomio (worker cooperative, mission-aligned)
3. **Open Source Communities** - Decidim, CitizenOS communities
4. **Academic Researchers** - Online deliberation labs at universities

### **Best for Learning What Works/Doesn't:**
1. **Loomio Wellington case** - well-documented 300-person policy deliberation
2. **Barcelona Decidim** - city-scale implementation with metrics
3. **Alliance for Civic Technologists** - network of practitioners with varied experiences
4. **Academic deliberation labs** - Stanford, others studying effectiveness

### **Contact Channels:**
- **Platform websites** - Most have contact forms or community forums
- **GitHub repositories** - For open-source platforms, developers are accessible
- **Meetup groups** - Local civic tech meetups in major cities
- **Academic conferences** - Digital democracy, civic tech conferences
- **Twitter/social media** - Many organizers active on social platforms

# HOW POLIS WORKS - Polis Consensus Finding Approach

  Core Mechanism

  Polis uses statistical clustering and machine learning to identify consensus by:

  1. Collecting statements - Participants submit short opinions (<140 characters)
  2. Voting on others' statements - Agree, disagree, or pass
  3. Clustering participants - Algorithm groups people based on voting patterns
  4. Identifying bridging statements - Finding what different groups agree on

  How Consensus Emerges

  Opinion Mapping:

  - Creates a 2D visualization showing how participants cluster
  - Groups form based on shared voting patterns
  - Distance between groups shows ideological separation
  - Consensus statements pool to the left of the visualization

  Key Innovation:

  Instead of highlighting divisive comments (like most social media), Polis elevates statements that find agreement across different groups. As people vote, the algorithm
  identifies:
  - Majority consensus - Statements most people agree on
  - Group-bridging consensus - Statements that opposing groups both support
  - Hidden common ground - Unexpected areas of agreement

  The Taiwan Uber Example

  The most famous demonstration:
  - 4,000+ participants with strongly opposing views
  - Initial positions seemed irreconcilable
  - Polis revealed: "Everyone really just cared about safety"
  - Consensus emerged on:
    - Insurance requirements for drivers
    - No undercutting minimum fares
    - App-only dispatch (no street hailing)
    - Background checks for drivers

  Technical Process

  1. Seed statements introduced
  2. Participants vote and add new statements
  3. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) maps opinion space
  4. K-means clustering identifies groups
  5. Algorithm calculates:
     - Statement agreement percentages per group
     - Cross-group consensus scores
     - Divisiveness metrics

  Why It Works

  Psychological Design:

  - No reply button - Prevents argumentative threads
  - Limited characters - Forces clear, concise points
  - Anonymous participation - Reduces performative behavior
  - Vote to see results - Encourages engagement

  Mathematical Approach:

  - Dimensionality reduction - Complex opinions mapped to visualizable space
  - Real-time updates - Opinion landscape evolves as people participate
  - Weighted consensus - Prioritizes statements that unite diverse groups

  Types of Consensus Found

  6. Universal consensus - 80%+ agreement across all participants
  7. Bridging consensus - Majority agreement in otherwise opposed groups
  8. Unexpected alignment - Issues where traditional enemies agree
  9. Priority consensus - Agreement on what matters most, even if solutions differ

  Key Insight

  The breakthrough is that Polis doesn't try to resolve all disagreements. Instead, it:
  - Maps the disagreement landscape
  - Finds islands of agreement within that landscape
  - Builds policy from consensus points rather than trying to solve everything

  This approach has proven especially effective for seemingly intractable conflicts where traditional deliberation fails due to polarization.
