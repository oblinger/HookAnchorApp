# V2 UX - Next Generation User Experience

## Overview

This document captures proposed user experience improvements and new features for Version 2 of the political discussion forum platform.



## Presentation Pane

The Presentation Pane is the primary view for displaying political positions with integrated challenges and commentary. It uses a two-column layout to show the main argument alongside contextual annotations.

### Layout Design

![Presentation Pane Layout](./presentation-pane.excalidraw)

**Left Column (2/3 width):** Main content area displaying the position
- Title/headline of the position statement
- Narrative explanation with supporting reasoning
- Bulleted key points at the bottom
- Specific text intervals are underlined to indicate annotated segments

**Right Column (1/3 width):** Challenge and annotation bubbles
- Rounded rectangles containing critiques of specific text segments
- Each bubble shows:
  - **Challenge type** (larger text): 1-3 word label like "Misleading", "Studies Disagree", "Wrong"
  - **Brief explanation** (smaller text): First line or two of the detailed reasoning, ending with "..."
- Light connecting lines from underlined text to corresponding bubbles
- Lines route between text lines to avoid overlapping content

### Interaction Patterns

- **Click underlined text**: Highlights the corresponding annotation bubble
- **Click bubble**: Expands to show full explanation and supporting evidence
- **Hover over line**: Shows preview of connection between text and critique
- **Vote on challenges**: Users can support/oppose each annotation

### Color Coding

- **Red bubbles**: Factual disagreements or errors
- **Orange bubbles**: Misleading statements or logical issues
- **Blue bubbles**: Minor corrections or clarifications
- **Green bubbles**: Supporting evidence or strengthening points
