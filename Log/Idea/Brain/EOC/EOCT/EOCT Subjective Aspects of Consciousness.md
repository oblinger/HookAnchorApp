- SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS - We each have the subjective experience of being conscious and aware.  
- CENTRALITY - We have the sense (belief) that this subjective experience is an indispensable aspect of being conscious and of generative "out of the box" behavioral creativity.
- NECESSITY - We doubt that any constructed intelligence that did not have a parallel sort of subjective experience would be conscious in the important way that we are conscious.

- WHAT IS HIDDEN FROM US - UNCONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE - Much of what we experience is hidden from us.  These experiences affect us, they can change the beliefs we hold, and the actions we take.  Still they are hidden in the sense that we cannot articulate them.  We often cannot state when they occurred or didn't occur, or what they were, what change they had on our beliefs or actions.
- UNCONSCIOUS INFORMS THE CONSCIOUS - 
- WHAT WE KNOW - CONSCIOUS THOUGHTS - 
	- Example:  being hungry causing one to be angry.  might be unconscious or conscious
- ALL THAT WE CAN KNOW - If we cannot "pull" some unconscious experience into a specific conscious assertion then we cannot "know" that experience even as we have been affected by the experience.
	- IMPT:  We need not be articulate about the details in order to have some knowledge from an unconscious experience.  
	  EXAMPLE:  For example we might decided somethings "not right" about this person standing on the street w/o being able to articulate anything further.  This is still knowledge which one can articulate, even if one cannot articulate why one believes this.
	  CONTRAST:  But if we never consciously thought there was something "not right", yet we absent mindedly crossed the street early in order to avoid the person, we can say we were affected by the perception, but we did not know it.
	
- KNOWLEDGE 




ASSERTIONS
- NATURE OF PART DECOMPOSITIONS and FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS
- NATURE OF THIRD PERSON PERCEIVER-THINKER-ACTOR SYSTEMS - 
- NATURE OF FIRST PERSON P-T-A SYSTEM

- UNDERLYING EMOTIONS AND UNDERLYING INTENTIONS - The existence of emotional states and intentional states.  Recognition that both emotional states and intentional states affect the thinking and actions of the FIRST PERSON P-T-A system
- CATEGORICAL MEMBERSHIP - 
- PRIVLEDGED INSTANCE - 

- PRIMACY OF "DIRECT" EXPERIENCE - Recognition that the unexpressable, irreducable "direct" experience is causally antecedent to the thinking and actions of the first person P-T-A system.

- VANTAGE - There exists an "ur" entity; a functional entity that is doing the perceiving and thinking of the first person P-T-A system. 
	- VANTAGE - This vantage of this ur system is connected to direct experience and actions
	- INSIDE - "inside" and "antecedent" to the P-T-A system, and is "inside" the first person body.
	- STAND ALONE - This 'inner' vantage stands alone, it is not the first person body, nor is it the first person P-T-A system that is KNOWN.  
	- DRIVING - Instead it is some irreducable, unknown entity responsible for thinking and action.
	
- EMOTIONAL / INTENTIONAL ALIGNMENT - The emotions and intentions of the first person P-T-A system are THE underlying emotions and THE underlying intentions are the primary drivers of the first person PTA system.

- IRREDUCIBILITY - This inner vantage appears to be atomic and irreducable.  

- UNREPRESENTABLE - This inner vantage is non-representational.
