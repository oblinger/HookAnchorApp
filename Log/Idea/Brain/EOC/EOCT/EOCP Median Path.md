## Summary

- [[EOCI]] 
- [[EOCI Human Reasoning Conjecture]] - Type II reasoning is the primary missing component and it could be developed anytime in the next years
- [[Loop_Closing]] - As humans are removed from the entirety of the activity loop an iterative process that process jumps discontinuously upward in efficiency
- [[EOCI Corp Decision Making]] - Corps make the choices 
- [[EOCI National Decision Making]] - Nations are power maximizers, but not a reliably as corporations

### 2024-00-00  TOP-BOTTOM-MIDDLE
- Most futurist analysis of AGI are top down.  Make sense since at some level such an approach can account for the broadest range of futures.
  But it eschews any causal or constructive analysis of the future.  both fuzzy in their predictions

# - LIKELY PATH -
- Top down arguments like Ray Kirzweil's analysis of AGI timelines based on moore's law have the advantage of being generalizations that at least appear to apply to all (or a wide variety) of bottom up approaches one might take toward AGI.
- Bottom up analysis have the virtue of being more concrete and potentially more precise since they are committing to a specific framework for achieving AGI.  But they also could be wrong if there is some other faster/better path to AGI.
- Still here we adopt a bottom up approach because of it specificity, and because we believe we can argue persuasively for the merits of each key assumption our bottom up approach makes.
