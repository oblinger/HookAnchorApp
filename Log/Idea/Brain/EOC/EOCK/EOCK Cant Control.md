**Executive Summary** - Even if this challenging objective of building ASI systems that are aligned to the purposes that humanity intends, we will still ultimately be at the mercy of these ASI systems as well as other unaligned ASI systems that humanity also has directly or indirectly created.  Humanity will not be in control. Instead, a plurality of these ASIs will be.


This is not an argument that there could not be a kind of ASI configured in a particular way that it was under human control for some indefinite period of time, that may or may not be possible. This is an argument about the tendency of the system as a whole over time.

We notice as a rule, in a competitions for control more powerful groups tend to dominate less powerful groups.  There are many exceptional situations where less powerful groups can effectively manage more powerful groups for extended periods of time.  Still in worlds with a degree of chaos, this inverted situation tends to fail eventually and when it does the fate and existence of the less powerful group is in the hands of the more powerful group.

We see this kind tendency across several different forms of power: physical 'muscular' power, mental or 'intelligence' power, perceptual power, velocity or 'speed' power.  In systems where
