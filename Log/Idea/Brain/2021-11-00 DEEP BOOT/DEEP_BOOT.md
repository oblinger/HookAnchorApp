# ### LOG ###
### 2022-01-04 - MERI GUY RESPONSE

- UNDERSTANDING THE FUTURE AS AN ENVISIONMENT

- REFLECTIVITY
	- Key capability required for GAI
	- Enormously/irresistably valuable & powerful
	- Inherently uncontrollable

- BEST WE CAN HOPE WE CAN:
	- BRIEFLY CAGE IT 

- NEED TO BUILD IT

_
### 2022-01-04 - REFLECTIVITY

--- TERMS ---
- POST GENOMIC TASKS / POST GENOMIC LEARNING -- Learning performed on tasks that are not connected to tasks or environments that exists during evolutionary times
- ARTICULATE REASONING -- Thinking / computation that can be expressed as a level that directly relates to 
	(or can reproduce) the thinking / computation in order to independently derive the same results. (CONSCIOUSNESS REASONING)
- REFLECTIVITY -- Articulate reasoning about articulate reasoning


--- REFLECTIVITY ---
- REFLECTIVITY NOT REQUIRED FOR STRONG PERFORMANCE -- More effective virus is not necessarily a more reflective virus
- REFLECTIVITY IS NOT REQUIRED FOR STRONG LEARNING -- Learning to run, 
- REFLECTIVITY CAN IMPROVE WHEN NATIVE PERFORMANCE AND LEARNING ARE NOT ALIGNED TO THE PROBLEM -- 
- REFLECTIVITY IS 
- REFLECTIVITY IS KEY -

### 2022-01-04 - WAYS TO CONTAIN IT

--- BROAD APPROACH CATEGORIES ---

FENCE GUARDIANS - Containment that does not depend upon reasoning inside, but rather at the edge.

THOUGHT POLICE - Containment that closely monitors and censors thoughs in order to ensure containment.

EQUANIMITY - Containment that depends upon the inherent nature of the contained GAI to not wanting to escape.

INHERENCY - The nature of the GAI is somehow self limiting by its very nature.



- UNCONSCIOUS THOUGHT COP - 

- OVERWHELMING COGNITIVE POWER - 

- INFINITE FENCE - A singular simple containment mechanism that is tied some unavoidable aspect of the physical or computational universe.  e.g. nothing can move faster than light, or there is no finite decimal expansion for square root of 2.

- ASYMPTOTIC ENVELOPE CONTAINMENT -- GAI can be viewed as a progression of AI systems that result from the reasoning of prior systems.  This containment approach is based on attributes inductively conserved across this progression of derived GAI system. 

- UNKNOWN UNKNOWN CONTAINMENT -- 

_
### 2022-01-04 - WAYS TO BREAK FREE

- END RUN - Escape containment by operating outside the perview of the containment mechanism.

- TAI CHI - Use the power/capabilities/knowlege of the containment mechanism to thwart it.

- STENOGRAPHIC ATTACK - Disguise attacking reasoning/actions as an indistinguishable part of legitimate reasoning/actions.

- MURPHY'S LAW - Complex mechanisms cannot be designed to never fail, thus in a situation where one failure is all that is needed to ensure permanent loss of control, therefore loss of control is a foregone conclusion.

- EMOTIVE IMPARATIVE - Striving to improve capabilty on nearly any significant real world task 
	"subtask" to improving generalized ability/capability; an inherent drive towards escape.
	==> True even for a system that genuinely is striving to NOT escape

- BUMBLING ESCAPE - Thinking is diverse and expansive.  It brings the thinker to places they did not intend.

- JAILER PSYCHOLOGY - Find humans that can be manipulated.

- Gödel's incompleteness - Any system strong enought to contain an level X attack requires capability of level X+1

### 2022-01-02 - Key Capabilities

- POST GENOMIC LEARNING
- META STRATEGIC LEARNING -- Learning full configuration and steps for various forms of learning and reasoning
- INSTROSPECTION -- Ability to abstract knowlege and reasoning into some compact rule grammar
- ABILITY TO BOOTSTRAP -- 


_
### 2021-12-28 - Deep Introspection Claim

Core Claims: 
- AGI requires? generalized introspective adaptation (GIA)
- GIA is uncontrollable


AGI requires
- Conscious reasoning chains
- Explicit optomization of reasoning chains

AGI requires creation of and optomization of
- PGRP - Post Genomic Reasoning Frameworks


_
#### PGRF - Post-genomic processing strategies
- Most professions that require years of training

### 2021-11-29 - Deep Learning + Bootstrapping Microtheory



**TEMPORAL PROCESS CAPTURE**
- CHAINS w CONTEXT -- capture all complex procedures as possibly branching temporal chains with recursive context.


HOW TO CAPTURE PROCESS -- Need to follow along:
- 

HOW TO BOOTSTRAP COMPLEX GOAL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR

- LINGUO-FEEDBACK FEATURE LEARNING (for goals and building blocks) -- deep learning paired with language and focusing heuristics allow teacher to quickly teach static recursively defined concepts.



CONCEPT TRIANGULATION
- SUBSUMPTION VIOLATION -- sub concept is triggered but parent is not
- GAP VIOLATION -- no child is triggered
- COLLISION VIOLATION -- multiple children are triggered on an XOR node
- CONCEPT FORMATION -- related situations getting reified


PROCESS TRIANGULATION
- TRANSITION VIOLATION
- MISSING NEXT STEP
