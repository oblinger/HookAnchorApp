## Ideas

### --- New Model Of Learning ---

#### Old Model Of Induction

Inputs:
- Training Set -- Training samples drawn iid from world and labelled with supervisory signal.
- Objective Function -- (scoring function)
- Supervisory Signal -- labelling of training elements with score.

Output:
- A 'hypothesis' a model drawn from the algs model class according to its bias which best matches the objective function over the training data.

Key assumption implicit underlying this model of induction as an engineering tool:
- The user of the induction algorithms does not have access to the 'hypothesis' being sought -- one the models the training data.  If they did have access to this hypothesis, then they would have no use for induction, since that model is the primary output of induction.


#### New Model Of Machine based learning.

Inputs:
- Interaction with a world of experience along with a benevolent teacher.

Expicit Assumption:
- The teacher knows something of, or everything of the concept which is targeted by learning.
- It is not convenient, cost/time effective, or practical for the teacher to supply this knowlege in a computational form.
- The teacher's knowlege is operational.
