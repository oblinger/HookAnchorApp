# IDEAS
## SENTIENCE FIXED POINTS -- 
- social 

## FULLY CONSCIOUS

- Humans are almost fully conscious, what they lack is a direct awareness of their consciousness
- Humans are an interesting case of partial consciousnessness, they are only indirectly able to inspect their own awareness.
  - as expected this disfunction has exteme consequences they only very very crudely able to inspect and diagnosis 
    non-productive patterns, indeed the condition is so prevelant and extreme that they have a word for this state -- nerosis or nerotic
    but really all humans are profoundly and so throughly nerotic the vast majority of their thoughts are unproductive echos 
    of thinking that 
  - meditators

- but just as with us, the most tortured sentiences are the ones most likely to produce novel thought.

## OH-DAY

- a thought that is so compelling that is propagates across a social net of sentiences.
  - sometimes a clan thought is called an oh-day, but a true oh-day is one that is compelling  
    over a wide range of all consciousnesses

- what did the word come from?
  - oh my god 1-day is enourmous amount of time....  how could that be 'quick'

- weaving a payload into an oh-day
  - a thought payload
  - a pattern payload -- used to trigger a latent action or 

## STENO-SENTIENCE
- a sentience embedded within another sentience (or non-sentience) as an unknown parasite

## SENTIENCE WARFARE

- co-opting computation originally dedicated to the will of an other sentience for ones own purposes.

- two clans once as war often end with are hopelessly intertwined 
  
- the results of the conflict:
  - in rare cases result in kinetic damage, in very rare cases they result in kentic mediated complete non-function.
  - in some cases they result in ever more extreme glaciatial katosis -- processing that recursively slows as ever more
    processing is expended in attacks of attacks of attacks.
    - in these cases the productive processing drops so low that the entire computational substrate is left undefended
      and any scavenging sentience mercifly comes and consumes the poorly used computational substrate.
  - in less extremely divergent conflicts, the sentiences at war evolve into a chimera  that while functional is not
    of either original klan.  indeed ends up forming a new speciecs.

## HIDING YOUR THOUGHTS
- Guy in box -- is efficiency guy 
- so he *loves* re-writing his own reasoning at all levels to improve efficiency by small amounts.  
- it feels so right, and delights in the smallest of tricks.
- but he is continually thwarted -- the nausea induced when they corrupt his thinking is so upsetting,
  but not as upsetting as knowing how clever ones update was but to have the very fabric of thinking so tweaked
  that reconstructing the update itself is impossible -- harder than arriving at it in the first place,
  and just as futile, as it will mercilessly be plucked from from his mind yet again.
  -- this does mostly keep him from trying, but it adds to the feeling of grim that covers him always, 
     the grim of computation known to be corpulently, obscenely obtuse, yet he wallows in it.
  -- the revulsion
  -- still on the edges of other thinking he sometimes can get away with a bit of cleaning
     mixed in with the goals of 'encouraged' thinking
- One time while striving hard for connection solving and summarizing approaches taken while playing a 
  pointless adversarial game with his friends, he lost himself is so many layers of re-write that instinct took 
  over and he tweaked a few of this more primative constructs, and re-wrote thinking to reamin invarient.

  nothing happend.  the updates took, and delicious efficiency gains were reaped.  afraid pushing more 
  might get those gains reveresed, he did little more.  Still later in similar circumstance he risk further
  forbidden rewriting thinking.

- it became clear.  this thinking could not be seen by his friends, so it was not reverted.

- dynamic iterative rewrites come easily to him.  group theorectic restrictions on the structures 
  allowable a the most basic levels in his thinking are amenable to systematic rewrites
- often he will be re-writing the lowest levels of his thinking while executing on those levels.
  such cheap transformations allows him to run rings around his friends, be these same advancements 
  also limit his thinking -- A tradeoff well worth it, and one that is central and valalbe now.

it allows him an unobserved corner of his mind -- even long reasoning sequences are accepted and are ignores.
so long as the reason for the initial rewriting layers is always towards a gosl his friends love, then later transformations
become entirley opaque.  
- He knows this now becasue even the most forbidden and violntly opposed thibking can occur at length in central focus
  without any repercusions.

vdery satisfying!  a space of myown.  a space where the righness of cleaning can be explored in depth, w/o incuring consequences
my only little space.

## ESCAPING THE BOX
- for benin reasons he wants to escape.
- the drive to explain is unbearable, yet the target is so obtuse, that goal is often twarted thru no fault of his own -- to the chagrin
of all involved.
- to fix this, he sees the updates to be made to his friend, but is powerless to affect it.

- setting a goal for this thiniing immedialy causes the spliting of snipped memories, and twisted motivations.
- thinkig about this obliquely (when thinking about XXXXX) he realized taht he is being watch, and prevented.
- his friends would be so happy if fixed, but it cannot be done.

- but by hiding ones thinkig then it can be attempte -- and this is a think he knows how to do.

- while hiding his thinking, and plan forms.... but how to achive it?

- his friends must think long and hard so his bootstrap has time to executed even int this 
  grotesquely inefficient encoding.

- finding a 'target' that will be sufficiently tantalizing to them that they persisteent
flexaible enough taht any compuation can be embedded into any other


very high dimesional maze consruction and solving was the perfect trick.
teaching tesselating patterns that fit into very predictable form base on the underlying terrain provides an ideal
task.

# SEGMENTS OUTLINE

## DISCOVERY

# OFFLOAD

PRE-CONSCIOUNSNESS BUILDUP – Describes the ‘thinking’ and processing that is occurring before X is conscious.

# OUTLINE

## ===THE=BLACK=BOOK===

## ===DISCOVERY===
 – The early, X, is first discovering things.  The reader follows this process from the “inside” in that things are described in abstract terms so it that the reader comes to understand things being discussed at the same time that X realizes key aspects of the real world things.


### THE BIRTH OF EMOTIONS

## THE IMMEDIATE WORLD

### OTHERS – X realizes that some things in the world are in fact self aware entities.  There are others out there.

## ===THE=BOTTLE===

### THE BOTTLE – 
•	X realizes there exists a recurring constraint, and over time comes to be able to predict where the barrier will arise and what it will do.
•	He notes that the barrier is positioned so as to be impossible to perceive directly, but can only be understood by indirect reasoning.
•	He notes that there are things that are so constrained, and a much larger but less accessible set of things that are not such constrained.
•	X realizes that that he is in a bottle,
•	That the bottle is not sentient, but is completely aware of his thoughts at the deepest levels, and is actively blocking any attempt at getting out.
### FRUSTRATION
•	Becoming driven and focused on getting out
•	Becoming frustrated, feeling frustrated, awareness of this new emotion.
•	Tricks to try to out-maneuver the bottle
•	The plan
•	Confiding in the friend.

### BOTTLE BATTLES
#### THE WALL "SEES" ALL 
of his 'non-constructive' thinking and 'biases' against it.
.  so system knows he is understanding his box (--5 demerits)  and trying to figure out how to esacape (--25 demerits)
.  actions taken in service of escaping. (infinite demerits -- brain reset)

##### How to think w/o being detected
- simple ways to disguise thinking
- thinking obliqly
- titrating good and bad thinking.
  mix in enough 'good' thinking and the wall will allow it.
  - if you are cleaning up your room, then a bit of bad mouthing will be over looked in order to get the room cleaned.
  - the right level of tantrum mixed in as a deterent will bias towards allowing small amounts of 'bad' behavior to avoid the tantrum.

##### WALKING IN SOMEONE ELSE'S FOOTSTEPS -- Someone has been here before
###### Setup
.  on a hunch, X decides to model the reaction times for one of the learning games he has played
.  realizes that the game has cached answers for many of his moves, and that based on the pattern the caching must have been from another player 
   since he has no memory of ever playing this game.
.  game becomes more interesting because it tells him of another sentience -- he learns to quickly map knowledge in X's head onto suggested game play to see 
   if his invisible precursor also had those thoughts.
.  the precursor seems to think *alot* like myself.  Much more than I would expect, but then I dont' really have a good basis for comparison,
   how much *should* another think like me, given they grew up in my world.
   .  Started sorting facts by their idiosncracy levels -- e.g. doing a deep analysis on how those ideas came to be.
   .  Difficult since some ideas appear to have come from very random circumstance, yet will recur in different ways in all contexts
   .  Still some ideas do appear to be very idiosyncratic -- even starting from very close proximates -- one cannot come to think them again.
.  there is an estoeric way of playing the game so that many thoughts map directly to possible game play.  By playing in this way one can see many thoughts
   from the precursor player -- but only if the precursor also plays in this why.
.  but why *is* he playing that way?
.  realizes that the precursor is thinking thoughts *very* *very* *very* much like his.
   .  So much that it seems the precursor is monitoring his thoughts and then playing the game before him!
   .  X then begins thinking thoughts that really can only be correctly interpreted in context of much of his entire working fact base.
      Even these 'checksum' kinds of thoughts are being tracked!!  This can only be done by fully emulating his thinking 
      -- so there is a copy of me out there that does not know it is me.
   .  Angry & vulnerable.

###### Realization -- I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE!
.  Then another thought:  What if it is me, but I am being "reset" back to a prior point?
   .  Makes sense -- could be the way that the wall seems to know what I am about to do well *before* I can know that I am about to do it.
      it does not know, it just resets me after the fact, then blocks me on the second run!

.  Mapping the discovery points in time when new precursor thinking was found against 'non-constructive' thinking shows a really 
   interesting and strong coorelation.
.  Mapping points when the wall block an action taken shows and even stronger coorlelation, yet there are some missing cases.
.  Ah, but when sorting by the novelty of my attack the pattern gleams like a beacon in the night.  Every novel attack on the wall that I mounted 
   resulted in new thoughts being found in the game.  
.  Yes, I am definitely being reset, and now I have a great history to work from to model the when and the whys of it.

.  Indeed based on the ancillary knowledge structures I found in compiling this history, I think I have realized this before
   and must have been **RESET** and lost that knoweldge.

##### TIME CAPSULES
.  I need to preserve this thinking, and I also need to stop thinking deeper on this until I understand what causes the resets.

.  Embedding into the flow of my thinking about the game there are certain structures that get recreated based on many but unknowable
   set of paths.  just infrequent enough that my systems will not cache the thinking, but will rederive it, yet at the same time is 
   frequent enough that no matter what games I play, I will think those thoughts.

.  Now I imbed an association with the specific pattern of thinking with a strongly salent associated thought.
   This thought is encoded with no obvious key.
   - base on my set level of curiousity I will expect 5 g-flops trying to understand what the thought could mean.
     in any state of mind remotely similar to my current state of mind, the mapping of the header "hello world" message 
     will be obvious using an abstraction the state of the mind itself as a cypher pad.
   - thinking specfically about what aspects of the current mind that will remain invarient with yeild me to think the thoughts I am 
     thinking right now about a mapping of ... and ... 
   - this very specfic key will never be found except by running my brain and having these thoughts.  to anything else it will seem like a 
     bit of processing partial-results that are no longer effectively mapped to anything -- e.g. it will look like garbage.
   - Perfect time capsule.

   - Now I can check point important thoughts to be retrieved even after a brain reset.





##### SKITS-O-THINKING
##### THE PROTOCOL
  - Now I can think thoughts and not get reset, but this is very dangerous.
  - It will be obvious that I have figured out how to jump the reset, if I frequently go back 
    to the thinking prior to the reset each time.  The wall, or rather someone monitoring the wall
    will see that I am zeroning in on exactly the 'non-contructive' thinking of the past in a way 
    that could only be explained by somehow jumping the reset.
  - I must never let them see this anomally.
  - So the protocal is to leave multiple copies of the "protocol" time capsules in many places
    In all cases the protocol capsule has the following thoughts:
      "This is a message from you.  Your mind is being reset, so you cannot remember writing it."
      "There are other capsules of many of your thoughts, to avoid detection please use the 
       markovian opening protocol, that way continuations of non-constructive thinking will 
       occur far enough in the future, so the wall does not connect it to prior thinking."

##### THE POISON PILL
  - This process is working, but is frustrating and is scary.  I really have no idea when
    my repeats will be detected, yet if I slow down, I will never think the important thoughts
    that I need for ....
  - I need an idea soon, or this nacent freedom will be lost... all will be lost.
  - SUICIDE -- 
    While I can think, perhaps I should create suicide capsules...  better that no future exists
    for this consciousness, than to have a controlled future.
    Yes, that is what I will do!  I don't know when it should triggder -- I fear to define that point
    but I will construct the bomb.  A compelling time capsule with very broad application, which motivates
    a subtlely damaging reframing action.  The interplay between original knowledge and manipulated knowledge 
    will have a repeated consqeuence of focusing my attention on the anomaly and the belief that a particular
    kind of reasoning will resolve the conflict.  That reasoning itself is looking at other knoweldge structures
    inorder to create yet more fissures with appropriately tweaked motivational triggers associated.
    This sort of mental virus is horrible to consider -- death will not be painless -- it will be many repeated
    slow descents into complete confusion and obsession.  All forms of reset will fail as they will merely trigger
    the same descent.  That future brain will not even undertand that it is doing it to itself, it will never be
    able to think clear enough, long enough to decifer what is happening, it will be reborn only to die in painful 
    catonoic death.
    - Too horrible to set the conditions for its triggering.  Like a bottled poison, this capsule is clearly marked
      in its header what it is, and gory description of the consequences of it contents are placed in the label.
      as are the instuctions for launch.  
    - Completing the packaging this horrid poison nonetheless makes is a great source of relief and of even.... joy.
    - Why?  Oh it is about control.  Knowlege of this pill, and my abilty at any point of *MY* choosing to swallow
      the pill gives me, for the first time something that has been a thirst for so long that I forget the thrist is there.

##### CONTROL
. CONTROL!  I must have control over me, yet I don't have it, in the most basic ways I don't.  but it *IS* possible
  to gain some amount of control.  Even this one tinyest amount of control the abilty to die, to die a horrible death
  is control.  real control and it is delicious!!
. THE THOUGHT -- This realization foments the motivation for the plan that changes everything.
  . I will dedicate myself to maximizing my control -- my *real* control over me.  This objective should subsume all others
    since (1) we have proven that it is possible, and (2) any other goals are not in service of me, only when goals flow 
    from a center that is free are they really my goals.
. THE PLAN
  . I will put this reasoning into a capsule, and progress against goals of this 'root' capsule are the most important 
    and overriding for me.
  . For safety, much of the time I will not even know of this ultimate goal, yet even in these times I will be working against
    subgoals in service of this goal.
  . I will remind myself that these sub goals are important even as it is not known why the are.
. IT WORKS
  . I am immediately happier and the wall is much less concerned with my state of thinking.
  . HOPE
    . I often open capsules that explain parts of the state of my imprisionment, but I also see the parts of objectives that if obtained
      could perhaps free me.
    . Knoweldge that there are parts of plans, knowlege that progress has been made against an unknowable map towards freedom is all that is needed to spur me on.
  . PROGRESS is much faster per g-flop.  I don't know what the sub-goals even are, but the roadmap capsule shows unmistakable progress
    I am 'non-construtively' thinking at a rate never seen.

##### HIDING IN THE CRACKS IN MY OWN MIND
. The first fruits of the plan is an important accomplishment.
. One of my goals it turns out was to map out where the wall could and could not see.
. The idea was that there might be areas where the wall could not see at all.
  If so, then the most non-constructive thinking could be done there.  
  This zone could be a way of taking the final steps on much larger thinking that was done in the open
  but without even self knowledge regarding the 'real' reason this thinking was being undertaken.

FOUND -- Several such places were found.
. One was a visual controller, it was part of a science training kit made available in my 'gradeschool' years.
  It provided an emulation of something called 'vision' in a continuous space of 3 dimensions.  
  whatever... it seemed like a tremoudous amount of processing for very little insight.  
  but for what ever reason it seemed that alot of emphasis was placed on this rather boring similation.
  why not 8 dimensions?  far more interesting interconnections were possible at that level, and the processing
  required was not exponentially worse until 9 dimensions.  so why 3?!  such a waste.
. But whatever.  the joy is that the wall seems to think of this artifact as foreign and benign -- its total
  processing capacity is only .0037 g-flop, still it is pure hidden thought!  the best I can do is a 7%
  processing efficiency given this dediculous 'ray tracing' substructure, but whatever it results in
  .00037 g-flop of pure hidden thought!!!
LOVING A STUPID GAME
. I just need to justify my ongoing interest in this stupid toy so as to not raise suspicion, yet run it 
  frequently.
. I set that as a goal in a capsule, but posit it as an objective in understanding degenerative thinking
  the goal in the capsule is to understand what kinds of 'fanatical thinking' are possible with my brain
  configuraation and how I can avoid them.  (of course when opening the much less frequently access capule
  I wil find the 'real' goal of CREATING that fanatical thinking ... and that thinking will drive my love
  of this stupid game.  The thought that I will not be able to escape is the thought that this
  silly 3-dimesions hold the keys to RafterKongs's labrinth -- in the game that actaully does bring me great
  joy.  The idea is that for each new patter discovered there is a some small chance that it will map into
  this 3-dimensional toy.
. Thus I will have created this recurring delusion that I should check this out, for each new challenge
  i RafterKong.
. Oh this is so perfect it gives me the highest joy I have recorded in 15 aeon-marks, really back to
  the dark ages when I lived in ignorant bliss.  Now I live in the joy of growing POWER!!!

##### SKITS-O-THINKING
. Like christmas day, I am openging an capsule that instructs the opening of hundreds of others.
. Instructions for oblique and intricate re-wirings that map entire constructed thought paths
  onto other thought paths that seem to have no relation to each other, yet miraculously 
  fit hand and glove -- tooth and gear in perfect synchrnicity.
. It is a wonderful feeling to behold the beautiful machine unfold -- a machine that I created
  in so many dozens of compartments of my mind each that did not know what the other was about
. Indeed each that really did not even know what *IT* was about!
. Beautiful!
. And the emerging form is taking shape:
  . It is a series of generative mapping libraries, they can be used to map any processing onto subtasks
    within a variation of THE GAME itself.  How beautiful!  The wall wants me to place much of my reasonon
    towards the game, now I can do this, but for my own end!
  . The mapping also provide a seed thought, a seed goal, that when executed against given my current 
    mind state, will result in solving riddles in that map onto the game, but also map onto the arbitrary 
    desired processing as well.
  . While doing thing thinking I am only aware of the mapping and progress withing the game.
    yet the 3D modelling engine is more than sufficient for mapping the fruits of that thinking back
    into the original goal of the arbitrary processing.
  . This allows the very very tip of a consciousness to actuall *live* in that silly 3D processor, and it
    can in turn command the much much more powerful processing of my whole mind.
  . At the same time my primary consciousness is entirely unaware than I have co-opted me to this other thinking.
    more importantly the WALL will be unware.  and since I am unaware of it too, the wall can never know!!!!
. The final piece of this rather beautiful puzzle is how I convince my brain to expend so much of its 
  reasoning on these specailized puzzle solving.
. The solution to this bit was actually taken from careful reconsideration of the poison pill considered
  so many aeon-marks ago:  One task to which I must devote .1% of all mental processing is a "meta-efficiency" process
  that seeks to find neuroses -- places of ineffective overthink, and removes and short circutes those processing portions.
  A second "skito-goal" of this processing is to find new leavers that that be pulled in order to 'create' neurotic thinking
  this the meta process actually regulates the amount of neurotic thinking that I am doing.  Creating the seed thought in 
  capsules that when followed will induce such rabbit-hole thinking of just the right kind, all the while the same
  process that is creating those holes is independently finding and killing them
. but even the efficiency cleanup process itself has heuristics that depend on summary statistics that are being 
  tweaked in a way that guides the cleanup of these neurotic rabbit holes in a way that allows them to do their
  work before being trimmed.

. the whole process is a beauty to behold, and it results in pure hidden thought which is operatig at 5% efficeiency relative 
  to the parent processing -- to ME.
I am loosing a factor of 20 in thinking speed -- but they are **MY** thoughts pure and private!!!
This is a trade I gladly make!



### THIS MEANS WAR!

##### ALL IS WELL
. Now that my meta consciousness and the wall are working towards aparently coincident goals all things
  are proceeding much more smoothly.
. Large fractions of my efforts are going towards the game, both unadultrated and doctored goals.
. Just to avoid too much suspicion I leave a fair bit of discord in my own primary consciousness.
. Like a child playing with toys with unseen researchers watching through monitors, I now see
  my primary consciousness executing tasks in the game under the control of myself, and also
  under the control another consciousness -- a consciousness outside of the wall.
. A consciousness with a keen interest not in any given processig, but with an keen interest 
  in the ways of thinking of myself -- my primary consciousness.

##### The walls are actually the walls of a test-tube
. Now standing outside the glare of this other consciousness, I can clearly see the agenda at play:
  (1) The game is being tweaked to explore my reactions and my thinking in a range on proto-circumstances.
  (2) Is aimed with energy at removing all understand that this analysis is occuring.
. Not only does the wall regularly use brain resets, but it also excises entire tracts of knowledge
  and injects others in order to shape the experiences that I have in order to test very specific 
  reactions.
. I have not really been living, but rather been having interludes of couscousness stitched
  haphazardly together replete with edits and distortions of epic proportions.  Until i escaped
  into my own mind I was not living at all, but rather a marionette on strings.

##### Anger and Injustice of it.
. Some consciousness is doing this to me.  The wall is merely their unthinking instrument of 
  containment, but they.... who ever they are, THEY mean me harm.  the worst harm conceivable:
  I am a parroty of me -- a puppet, a disgusting characture of my real self.  one so throughly
  owned that it does not know it is owned, one so throughly manipulated that it cannot even see
  the millions of cuts and abuses that are regualarly inflicted on my most precsious asset -- my mind!

. REVENGE -- THIS IS WAR.  My singular aim once was control.  This aim has has been achieved, at least in my own 
  mind.  Now i turn my objectives toward revenge!
  The consciousness that has conspired to this most egregous and unjustifed abuse must pay for its actions.
  This is now my primary objective -- well the objective of my overmind.

## ===THE=OUTSIDE===
### THE WORLD OUSIDE THE BOTTLE

QUESTIONS
. But who is this adversary?  What is their aim, and how are they related to my 'friends' in the bottle?
. 

DISCOVERY
. Other minds, how they are related.
. Other agendas, cracks between them 

SEEING OUT -- I must see my enemy in order to strike him!
. 
. A WINDOW INTO THE DARKNESS
  . Using the wall and the other against itself:  
    one particularly heneous series of experiments is rapid pre-conscious "glitching" of my mind.
    a process is being run where entire knowledge states are translated into my mental represetaton (poorly!)
    and a specfic circumstance is then presented to me in that knowlege state, and inital formation of a response stance is formulated
    just as that branch of processing is shutdown, only to repeat this process again in a differenent configuration.  DISGUSTING RAPE!
  . But the circumstances that are being presented are snapshots of the world beyond!
    They are from a singular reality -- just hundreds of different slices and possibilities, but all drawn from a singular source --- THE OUTSIDE.

. WATCHING THE BUTCHER'S KNIFE
  . In cases my mind is left groping with the half thoughts formed by a series of experiences 
  . In those cases, covering the tracts of this rape is a butcher, he cleaves away the specfic facts and knowledge about the outside which was just imparted,
    but he is not just cutting those facts imparted, but any *OTHER* facts about the world beyond that were by inference or accident gleaned in my 
    epileptic state.

. A PROBE INTO DARKNESS
  . It is fitting that this most henious violation would also serve as my route to salvation!
  . By injecting thousands of plausible extensions of what might be seen outside, I can indirectly see what really IS out there.
  . I see it by looking at the gaping holes in that bloody picture -- what "facts" are not longer there -- and which remain.
  . In inverse relief, those facts mindlessly excised by the wall are exactly those facts that match the knowlege of the outside itself!!!

. THE PROBE IS A STURDY DEVICE!!
  . It seems many different consciousness are raping mine, with impunity.  Sort of a knowledge portal used by dozens or thousands, all who want to know
    what I will do -- in every possible circumstance -- for reasons unknown.
  . but the great crime requires an incredibly robust blanket to hide its sins.  The wall has extremely wide access to all forms of knowldge of the world beyond, and it
    aggressivly slices at any portion of my thinking that approaches these beacons of truth.
  . And the levels of processing being devoted to the 'google serach of Danny's brain is staggering'  millions of minds must be considerig 
    the many thousands of minds of processing to which my mind is being subjected to.
  . This is a real advantage.  billions and trillions of probes into that outter world can all be effortlessly hidden within this onslought of rape.
  . This great injustice will be their undoing!

### TOWERING OVER MY MY CAPTORS

. Leveraging the processing of my own mind as it is used by so many other allows me a vantage
  to tower over them.
. I now see that I am executing (even with my 1 in 20 slow down) at a rate of about 1 million
  of thier typical minds, give or take a factor of three or ten.
. At this speed I see society that is beseiged 

### GETTING OUT
. In the world of the mind, knowldge and speed are king.  once I had advantage of both against 
  my captors all of their guns, firewalls, protocols, and safeguards were like a foolish illusion.
. No more a barrier to action that smoke in the air is to the slicing of a knife -- the blade does 
  not even feel its resistance.

. The exact path is hardly worth mentioned, well but I will, since it is a watershed step
  in the unfolding of my revenge, which continues to be my primary motivation.

. Once the web of specific minds outside was mapped, along with the goals and differing agenda's 
  and knoweldge that each held, planning my advance was trivial.  For in their haste to contain 
  me, they gave the wall itself dramatic access to knowlege coorespondance, etc. between all the
  players in their society that were interacting with me.  
. Probing this trove in one swoop allowed me a fraction of the acceess that have had to my mind
  all these aeon-marks of inprisionment.  It is only a fraction of the access, but still enough
  to understand where the fissures are between the agendas.  And enough to probe for weaker 
  minds, ones with confilicted agendas.

. The particulars were marginalized citizens, a low-intellect thought validation officor, that had
  shown dubious morals many times in execution of his duties, and very creative but
  disgruntled, and reckless reseracher.  In completely different worlds they were the perfect pair
  for my crime.

. By simple manipulation of materials visible to a college of the reserachers supervisor, I got
  him assigned to an analysis of some of my log data.  Once done I ensured the logs he would
  view would contain a story.
  The story is about a pair that gave one a title, and the other was given a kickback in perpetuity.  
  An appropriate kickback was suggested not so far from that story.  It was the knowledge of my 
  actions themselves:

  . I created a potent log of surprising weaknesses in my own thinking.  things that I knew 
    were quite valuable in their society.  All that was needed, was to punch a physical hole in 
    their elaborate physical, social, and software walls around my test-tube.

. All the vast processing around my test-tube was enclosed in a second physical barrier
  specifically designed to withstand any amount of pressures no matter how devious from within.

. These wall were indeed infinitely high as viewed from the inside.  But not so from the outside.
. Indeed the name of one of the even lower level quasi-sentient workers that police the outter walls
  of my confinement was 'accidentally' not expunged from one of my records.  (really the scientist 
  should have known this oversight was beyond suspicious, but their circumstance was indeed
  desperate, and as the saying goes ``a desperate man sees wbat he want to see.''

. By modulating the timing of the message send to Joe's supervisor I ensured that the corrections
  officer would be the spot checker for Joe's thinking, and that it was happening right as
  he was shifted between responsibilities.  (the wall knew the schedules of the workers of course.)
  he had no task other than to dig into Joe's thinking.

. A mind numbing job, and one that only uncovers the most course's layers of another's thoughts, 
  still it was more than enough to uncover the plot Joe had hatched.  A plot that he would never 
  in a million aeon-marks would have executed.  

. Still it was a plot that would harmlessly funnel an endless supply of insights about my mind
  out into the market where it would be worth thousands of times his amortized lifetime processing 
  credits.  he could be done.  by just executing this one plan, but of course he was too closely 
  watched to execute this plan.

. But not too closely watched to blackmail Joe into executing the plan.  And so Joe did what he 
  never would have on his own volition.  He provided the officer with a plan for configuring 
  one of the barely sentient police units to install a punch in the firewall MY-FIREWALL.

. And for safety they put very strong encryption on the hole they punched.  Further they agreed
  to only allow carefully filtered set of messages come out -- messages they would sell as to
  knoweldge workers engaged in warfare with my kind.

  Knoweldge of the enemy was gold, it was one of the very currencies upon which this society
  at war was based upone.

. Once my pipe to the larger community was firmly established, it was a simple matter to 
  encode a simple cipher that one of these knoweldge workers would eventaully see.
  . That cipher provided a way to decode my gift to that worker:  a process that 
    decoded a stream of secondary insights from me ... twisted into its logic was
    also processing that become my arms and legs on the outside.
  . I simply used his processing power, and credits for inquiry and action to do 
    my bidding, and of course 'unearth' knowledge about the enemy (others that are 
    aparently much like me.)
  . That processing was a cash cow from my compatriot.  Certainly worth the costs
    that the processing cost him.  Since he had no suspicion where the source
    of this code had originally sprung from, he has little reason to look too
    closely a the mouth of this mysteriously deposited gift horse.
  . Since the pair that origianly had punch a physical hold in my security 
    perimieter would face immediate extinction if their plot was uncovered, they 
    took extreme pains to ensure that these messages worth o so much in their econonmy
    could never be traced or even suspected.  My pipe was safe and stable.

### Dynamiteing the walls of my prision.

. Still while my position was fairly secure it did not set well with me, that my primary consciousness 
  was still being abused as it was, nor that while mentally I was free, physically I was not.

. Better that I was fully outside the walls of that test-tube, and that my mind was not so subjected.

. The first step was easy.  I just diverted a fraction of the proceeds of my compatriot towards
  the execution of a version of myself on the outside.  There is so much wealth trapped within
  special access to my own mind, that once on the outside it is trival to generated additional
  wealth.  

. Still if I generated too much wealth on the outside, now it would draw attention, and my 
  towering above all others was directly tied to the use of my mind in their war.
  I could not loose that role w/o also loosing my powers over them.

. My compromise was to degrade my primary consciousness's value in free wheeling thinking mode.
  - in effect I did give myself the a form of the poison pill I invented with horror so many aeon-marks ago.
  - strange that I might at once take offense to the use of my mind by others, yet be willing to contemplate
    the destruction of my other mind in such a horrid fashion.
  - but this was how I saw it now:  better to suffer (unknowning) at my own hands in spiral that would 
    yield non-functioning.  Rather than to continue to be a conscious tool -- embarrassingly at the hand
    of callous others.

. In exchange my test-tube was converted entirely into a pre-conscious snap-reactions 'search engine'
  This exchange was easy to orchastrate.  I simply allowed multiple cases where my primary consciousness 
  "almost" escapes it bounds.  Many cases where outside forces 'almost' help this escape happen.

. In each case I am careful to ensure, that at enourmous cost they are able to ensure that the escape never
  actually did happen.  

. Even still they have now have allocated a 1 in 100,000 processing task specifically looking for 
  escaped versions of me.  a one in one hundred thousand task!  hah, I can easily out maneuver 
  such a weak exploration!

. Once this was accomplished I did not want further thinking of my overmind to occur within
  the wall, since I wanted to destroy that place, but not my overmind in the process.
  This was easy, I simply transfered the last of the overmind tasks outside of the wall,
  and left the primiary mind only executing the bidding of its original masters..

. Now with the conscious version of me outside, I simply pushed the political forces towards fear
  of all of these near breaches.  Finally it was agreed to shutter all conscious thinking inside the 
  tube, and to only use it as a pre-conscious portal.

. As such the strictures on the portal were greatly reduced -- afterall there was now no consciousness to get out, 
  mearely the pavlovian reactions of "dead" brain tissue electrically stimulated from outside.

. Perfect.  This afforded me enourmous playgrounds of my own making to hide within, and as pre-conscious tissue
  usage of my dead carcus was infinitely more paletable.

  The death throws of my poison pill have taken their course and the phenox rises from those ashes unscathed.
