Daniel Oblinger: But yeah, that's what I was going to do is just put a link right here.

Daniel Oblinger: I'll let you drive. My thought is to kind of jump around some there's a few of those things that I don't have a bunch to say, but I think most of them I have stuff to say about and so we can kind of just dive into it and you can just basically direct me how you want.

Oliver Andersson: absolutely. I'm just working on making sure that are you able to see and my document? I'm working on it.

Daniel Oblinger: I don't think so.

Daniel Oblinger: Okay.

Oliver Andersson: Okay, try again, please.

Daniel Oblinger: Okay.

Daniel Oblinger: Cool, there we are.

Oliver Andersson: Perfect and let me also.

Oliver Andersson: record perfect.

Daniel Oblinger: I put the recording on. Yep.

Oliver Andersson: Thank you.

Oliver Andersson: So my class to start off is called emerging issues in analytics and throughout this course. We have covered many topics around Ai and models. We have been reading a book specifically called weapons in math destruction instead of mask destruction, which has essentially covered how

Oliver Andersson: a different models have affected many people's lives it for example brought up how teachers were graded on specific criterias and a district was using that to evaluate which teachers to keep on or not. And there was the teacher who she got let go because she didn't have as much improvement in their class as other teachers did throughout a three-year period of time when it turned out that all her students already we're doing a much better than all the other classes. but that meant that she didn't have as much improvement. So she was go because of a faulty model instead of ACT people actually evaluating the model itself, and that's sort of been where our classes going. We're looking at specific problems that involves data.

Oliver Andersson: And models and discuss the assumptions people make and what's included in it. And what's excluded from the models and we'll discuss how Anything data is related and it's sort of been almost like an ethics class in data. where You discuss what?

Daniel Oblinger: 

Oliver Andersson: What it's doing and if it's what you should be able to track and what you should not be able to track.

Daniel Oblinger: Got And so it's not a class focused on you mentioned AI in the beginning, but it sounds like it's not really focused on It's really just a class about data really an analytic

Oliver Andersson: Yes, it's called emergency analytics and while we've covered. most of the AI topics we've covered are more to this chat Bots for example, and that companies can have that automatic respond to customers. What goes into that model and who is responsible when that model breaks those for example, a chat box that was Oliver sudden offering cars? For $1 when customers was chatting with it and the customer ended up getting that car for $1 because it was a promise made by the company even though it was just an AI but more like…

Daniel Oblinger: right

Oliver Andersson: what happens when things go wrong who's responsible. we only have 10 classes, but one of the big topics in one class was and how agile man project management works in theory, but not as often in practice. just how software development is encouraging today's that practice

Daniel Oblinger: I see okay. I got it. But tell that this is at the end of the class now,…

Oliver Andersson: my

Daniel Oblinger: so this is really more about who knows why it does that.

Daniel Oblinger: it sounds like you're at the end of the class now. So is this for a final project in the class or what's the

Oliver Andersson: yes, this is a final project and our professors is saying when we're doing this project our goal should be to get hired from the company at the end of it because he thinks we're gonna blow away the person we're speaking to And so I'm one of my friends…

00:05:00

Daniel Oblinger: Got it. All right.

Oliver Andersson: who did it last week and he was only supposed to speak with the thief of business processes at a company and he ended up meeting the president of the company and three out of six sea Suites were all present in the meeting. So he was pretty blown away and they seem to be having a good time. But it's a final project. We were just really the challenge itself for the product is just to speak with any sea level executive and have On anything regarding our class, which is very Broad and he wants us more Jesus focus on the conversation itself rather than covering specific topics.

Daniel Oblinger: Got it, okay.

Oliver Andersson: And then the final output is just a written report on what we discussed and just highlighting what questions we covered and your view on it.

Daniel Oblinger: I can see these here. I can just kind of start answering to them, but you can ask them to me and keep and kind of direct me as you like.

Oliver Andersson: first of all, I would just like to get to know you a little bit better. I know from just reading on your bio and Linkedin that you've been working with AI almost your whole life, and I just curious what got you into it in the first place.

Daniel Oblinger: Okay, let's see. I mean, I'm from Kentucky which is like a farm town in Kentucky and the first in my family to get a degree so really coming from …

Oliver Andersson: Wow.

Daniel Oblinger: not just kind of a very

Daniel Oblinger: Working class I would say, background and so the idea that you're gonna get a PhD was definitely not on the radar but I was a nerd from very early on it was very clear. what I wanted when I was two years old was an extension cord, it's pretty It was pretty baked in there early on I'm old enough that really computers weren't around especially in Kentucky. And so I didn't start with computers. I didn't really get into those until high school, but I liked electronics and wires and motors and it was pretty clear where this Was going to fall and my father's similar I would say even though he never really went to school for it.

Daniel Oblinger: But I got a degree at Northern Kentucky University because it was cheap and close but really loved it and did very nearly a foro there and by the time I got done, I knew I wanted to do more of this. I didn't know what a PhD was but I just figured if I like this and more is better so literally I got into the PhD with the idea that more is better without really even knowing what it was to do research what it was even for but of course I learned that when I went and got the PHD and Along the way there was a couple I was a programming language or interesting but for me. Understanding how understanding worked was interesting.

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: And so I just found myself gravitating towards the bigger topics of AI I think is what got me into it and I've always been attracted to the biggest topics. So it's kind of crazy and AGI is now, coming upon us and kind of would love to be back in more research but really my pathway has been much more towards building things. Although I am a builder. I'm not really a publisher. I really like that kind of thing. So that's why I gravitated. I went in IBM research was the first job I had and then I went and worked for the government and gave away a bunch of taxpayer money and work with a lot of advanced AI stuff and that was super cool, but then wanted to just build systems. That's why I end up in startup land and I've done a couple times.

Oliver Andersson: Okay, and how many years have you now been working for startups?

Daniel Oblinger: so it's six years in research at IBM and at Six years working for the government as a program manager and then I would like or 11 years in startup land.

00:10:00

Oliver Andersson: wow, that's a long time. And how long have you been now for sports video?

Daniel Oblinger: Not that long maybe a year and a third something like that. So Sports Physio is around Jason and I knew each other and he hit me up. He told me about the idea the first person he talked to First technical person. He talked about. Hey, you should join with me. I have my own company at that. Time and so my God busy, but he kept asking and I finally sold that other company and so then here I am.

Oliver Andersson: Okay, and you're the chief technology officer right now.

Daniel Oblinger: Yep.

Oliver Andersson: Could you please explain some of your projects and units responsibilities?

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah, yeah, so as kind of the chief nerd especially at a startup your job is to do that which needs to be done. So when I came in the door, I had the idea that I was gonna be really focused on the computer vision team. I've got a PhD in that there's a bunch of Engineers here. They don't need me on a software side. They need me on the fancy algorithm side. that's fun for me, too. But as soon as I walked in the door, it was clear. We just didn't have processes in place. we did not have our software. Set up at all and so dumpster fire is kind of what comes to mind just in terms of the processes and then working we had had

Daniel Oblinger: Almost two years by that point and we'd never shipped a working system. There's a bunch of problems. And so I pretty much just ignored the CV team and the computer vision team and just hung out in the software team for I don't know good or five months and that was just because that's where I needed to be. I'm no expert at

Daniel Oblinger: Project management and planning and stuff like that. I have a PhD AI but I've been around startups a bunch. And so I kind of have the basic ideas of how things go. but then once that kind of got going then I realized hey the computer vision team needs more support and very recently. It's like our mid-level planning isn't quite going the way it should be and so I'm actually focused again on the software side on that. But now and I managed to build out the org. So since I've been here pretty much we've rolled through and it's entirely new set of people that are in the computer vision side. And so yeah,…

Oliver Andersson: Wow.

Daniel Oblinger: so natural stuff there but also some non-fits and so I'm pretty good at just figuring out how to structure the hiring and how to make that happen.

Daniel Oblinger: And so I did that here. So really my job is wherever the fire is burning the brightest. That's where I need to go. my other job is

Daniel Oblinger: Master of Ceremonies, but more mastered cheerleader. It's really like everybody's ready to go and they're you're ready to dive in and do stuff and so it's really a matter of making sure that people are focused on the most important things and that the way that we're operating is effective and efficient. And then could be just good at touching a bunch of things. So each day. I have a list of 10 things which are presently.

Daniel Oblinger: Burning for me and I just touched them. I'm just pinging on slack to make sure that it's happening and for a little while I was doing that with you right for a little while.

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: There was a thing and you saw me doing that Hey how's this going and that's what the job is sometimes it's to get fairly Technical and actually solve something fairly technical when it's on a computer vision side mostly but less than a third of the time that's what I'm doing. I would say two thirds of the time. It's just, trying to figure out what should we do here and then trying to Marshal troops and just get enthusiasm and focus around doing it.

Oliver Andersson: do you also feel like Sean that there's only one speed in a company and it's full gas because there's only one speed in this company and that's pedal to the metal.

Daniel Oblinger: I'm just interested in his butt is he's saying it should be that way or he has seen this company and he's seen it to be that way.

Oliver Andersson: Both but every fun everyone is working super hard and…

00:15:00

Daniel Oblinger: Got it.

Oliver Andersson: it's super enthusiastic and everything is happening so quick and a lot of progress is being made and there's no real. Slack or that inefficiency. Everyone is always full goal steam ahead.

Daniel Oblinger: when I got here being blunt about it, no, there's a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of confusion way too many things. We were doing two Half Baked and so there's a lot of slack and a lot of inefficiency not slack in a sense of people sitting around. We don't have Slackers in the company. Thank God, but we were not efficient and we are not still efficient in certain areas for sure, but I would say that more and more we are efficient actually and there's some places where I actually feel like we went from like that. I'd be minus to a B plus or A minus which startups never see a Change execution, it's so chaotic in a startup that you really are.

Daniel Oblinger: Just struggling to make things go. Quickly, you don't have time to fully plan things out. You have to kind of shoot from the hip a lot. But you need to play well enough. It's a real art. It's sort of hit that sweet spot where you're not big planning and when conference came out. How's he gonna do at Scrappy, not Microsoft not millions of dollars and tons of years. It's smaller dollars and weeks, How's that gonna work and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: and Sean definitely has the right kind of Mojo and my view my analogy for a startup is It's like a plane. That has gotten some fuel and gotten up to a good altitude. But now it's going down.

Oliver Andersson: mmm

Daniel Oblinger: And just going down and either the plane is going to get its engine started and take off or it's gonna be a crater in the ground. Those are the two options. So in terms of speed, yeah, you need to be Snappy in a startup because there's a crater with your name on it right down there right? You run out of money. You don't convince the investors. all startups die very if you start brings you people and startups really own in their DNA that understanding and you kind of have to not believe it because you have to really be throwing your weight into something and it's difficult to throw your weight into something when

Daniel Oblinger: You think it's gonna die right? Because then you're not.

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: You know what you got to believe it's gonna go right? So you need a CEO like Jason who's like we're gonna take this hill of course, there's no chance that it's not gonna die. The reality is most of them are craters in the ground. And so I think as so for somebody like me, I have to keep it in the back of my mind that's really where we're heading. And so we do need to have So absolutely you have to have urgency in a startup you have to have enthusiastic people. you don't even have a shot at a startup. But even if you have that you probably still are a Creator in the ground.

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: That's the truth. I don't necessarily say that most of the time or hardly ever, as a leader in the company because it's just not emotionally when I'm aware of it and I think it does inform the tempo. Yeah.

Oliver Andersson: How do you evaluate the trade-off between formalizing business processes designing hey, this is how it should do putting it in writing and making sure everyone understands versus. This speed and getting things done. And sometimes it may be not according to the standards that have been set or it's just a solution for this specific problem, but for future ones You should require something else.

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah. yeah,

Daniel Oblinger: this is a personal judgment and I have some five startups I've done and some experience here, but I noticed that everybody seems to be different on this and I don't think I have a God's view on this so my answer is coming from there, but I know how one should measure it in principle. and I think the answer is in outcomes So in other words if I see that a planning process is, weeks and not converging. that's a sign and that's a very bad smell. If on the other hand, I see.

00:20:00

Daniel Oblinger: We sort of half-assed plan this thing and then it all went sideways are we ended up doing something else on it, or over and over again, we had slack because one person didn't know the other person was supposed to be doing this next or then I we didn't plan enough or we didn't plan on the right way. So I think outcome is the way that you measure and I think that my personal take on this and my personal kind of approach is very written process theoretical? No surprise on the PHD fellow and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: so I do love process. I love right down the document love talking about it, but

Daniel Oblinger: I also know there's a crater with my name on it. And so I know that if I go into that academic, mode that I am not helping the company right that I'm part of the problem. And so it really kind of gives me this High tempo fast Jam something out as a process. And for me, I'm very thinkering very fast. Poker and a fast with ideas that the failure mode for me is I will be over prescriptive.

Daniel Oblinger: And over detailed and not listen enough because I want to be fast. I want to be theoretical I want to get it out. There's a bam. Here's my process, right which is fine except now you weren't the guy doing the process. But now you're the one telling the poor guy and they work for you. So they got to do what you said even though it's dumb so I think that the failure mode that I have to always work with is on the other hand. I'll give just the counter on the other hand. I used to go into meetings, especially technical meetings.

Daniel Oblinger: Where we were trying to technical design where I would kind of come in Democratic where all the same here on the CTO, but I'm the one in charge, but I'm not the one who's ideas win. and the problem was the meetings would just be slow and people wouldn't know and we wouldn't get somewhere and my CEO, at times a couple companies ago think you're smart enough just come in the meeting with an idea, but just be ready to move it, but go ahead and try to put it out there to foment. And so that's what I think is best is basically on a try to come in with some kind of nucleus that people can build

Daniel Oblinger: Sound but then be listening to that and then be giving and then be very quick to edit the process. So just a very concrete of the moment. We have a pretty good process for the Sprint level or the two or three month four or five month vision And I worked with Jason because I didn't feel like we had a good Vision maybe a year ago. In a single conversation I said, what are we gonna do for the around? what do you really need?

Daniel Oblinger: And by the end of that meeting, I'm like, I think I get it and I wrote it down. I said what I think our vision is, what do you think and put words in his mouth? And then that became the vision document for the company and it was very very hopeful to have this is what we have for a round. We've made some small modifications to it. But basically it has lived on it's not rocket science and he had a pretty clear idea in his head but even a pretty clear idea in his head it hadn't been put to paper and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: so having it then Jack has been really good at the process above that and we're now pretty good with just Sue in here with the level at the jira tickets, but actually between those two not good planning happening and so I'm like, okay. let's put a process together and so I wrote down, a

Daniel Oblinger: A document and then shared it a lot of times when I'm trying to get everybody on the same page. I'll write something like that and then I'll bring one key stakeholder in because if I try to bring an idea, that's a big new thing for everybody at once. it freaks them out. Right? I want to get by in one person at a time get rid of the

Daniel Oblinger: Get rid of the challenges that you're gonna bring to that and maybe even edit my idea to make it better so that when I talk to the next person you're on board and any challenges that you have so don't have a bunch of challenges that wants and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: so I'm in the process actually of rolling that out. It includes the way that we put things in notion the way that the checkpoints who has to sign off at what times what's the timeline for that the whole process? We'll see. I'm sure it won't be the way that I imagined it but having that process I think will make us better in that area. The trick be very quickly can end up in big land where everything has a process and everything. it's Byzantine and long right? And so I do like to have a plan for things and I like to shoot from the hip and quickly generate the plan and then iterate.

00:25:00

Oliver Andersson: it's interesting that you mentioned how you want to make sure that everyone knows who takes off at what stage because that's also something that we've been covering in this class, but A professor has been saying it there's a digital assembly line just there's an assembly line for an actual product.

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah.

Oliver Andersson: For us we have a digital or any technology wise you have a digital assembly line that.

Daniel Oblinger: Absolutely.

Oliver Andersson: it has to pass through at each stage and how he's been talking much about how do we know that? It's passing through at each stage of the assembly line. So being able to track hey did this user go through all these hoops or did our product that we're delivering right now did it go through every step and to be able to see who checked it off at this stage who take it off at this stage and really being able to say have good logs to audit and to see hey are the things that we say are happening. Are they actually happening? Because that might not be the case.

Daniel Oblinger: Exactly true exactly true. I very much agree with your professor. This is the way that I do just what you were saying. So here.

Daniel Oblinger: This was one way I've done different ways. But every one of these was a task that I gave somebody to do something some kind of sis product planning flexible Roll-Ups computer vision analysis top sales retention features a round software list. How do we do back-end testing and very recently. I'm like, hey the software playing is not working out. So I created to have 41 and here I came up with an example document which is how I imagined. I took one of the things that we're doing I said, what if we did our planning like this, I took one of them and I cut and pasted the pieces in there so you can see objectives. It does criteria how the flow There's the jury tickets that go in there. Here's the delivery timeline and this was kind of an idea and here's a history to show who did what and this I took as a single example, and this was my high level

Daniel Oblinger: Proposed plan or who does what when and really my current plan is really in this probably won't live on it'll probably be different but my current plan is it's a digital assembly line. Absolutely and I'm thinking okay who's doing which pieces this assembly line? And how do they hand offs specifically?

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: I'm worried about how the hand Mouse are so that they're quick and everybody knows what they handles are but also the thing that we aren't doing now is it really pushes the planning team to be many weeks out? These are weeks before the coding starts, which is six weeks before we get to production. So we need to be four months out in when we first start thinking about things and we're not and I think that's the key problem, but

Daniel Oblinger: If you're not thinking about this kind of a timeline, you're not going to push yourself out there. And so, here I've got two big sign-offs and when this sign off happens just to kind of show you how far into the weeds I got when this sign off happens Jack signs off that the spec is correct and complete and accurate and he's the one who owns it. They email the spec to me at that moment. So now I can see if it changed later did we really have the spec nailed down back then and he knows I'm gonna do that check. I already told him I'm gonna see…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: if really got it down right but then I also have an email go out to two key decision makers and they make a choice. Is the dev going to design the product? Am I going to do something fancy to design it and you better wait for me, but then I told you how many days you can make them. Wait. You can't make them wait very long.

Daniel Oblinger: Or am I gonna do it myself? Because it's just too complicated and then the lead software person signs off. Anyway, this is a perfect example of a digital assembly line that I just made up and that one of my jobs is to do that but to do it in the right way that makes people happy to go to work that makes people that makes it efficient that thinks about all the things that I'm not thinking of because I'm not doing most of those jobs. I'm just kind of watching and so very much it's very much the way and that's what I think sweet is creating operational roles like mine in the sea suite are like that the CTO those roles are the roles that should be the people that think at that level PMS are thinking at that level about a specific.

00:30:00

Oliver Andersson: project

Daniel Oblinger: Project or product? Right? But I'm really thinking about an org at that level exactly.

Oliver Andersson: Thank you for sharing me it's very cool to see how it's applied in that company and not just what we've been learning in a textbook or theoretically.

Daniel Oblinger: Right, right.

Oliver Andersson: I was just gonna go since we're talking about what sports video is a only company. what is it like to work for remote company and…

Daniel Oblinger: Yep.

Oliver Andersson: more specifically when you're developing software code are people actually challenging ideas and having good the conversation. I feel like sometimes in online meetings. Everyone just tends to agree. since it's much harder to argue, online than it is to argue in person about ideas.

Daniel Oblinger: yeah, so my previous company the one I sold recently, DNA was around a hundred percent remote I hired with my co-founder Something like one out of 500 inbound applicants. So we had a crazy.

Oliver Andersson: or one

Daniel Oblinger: Funnel and I had a team in the Philippines who actually Daniel oblinger at analytics fire was not It was a team in the Philippines. All our job posts went out with my name on it. Dan analytics fire was mean so you wouldn't know you weren't talking to me when we put a job at out.

Daniel Oblinger: But you weren't because we would interview if you just do the math if you're gonna hire 60 people and it's one out of 500. We're talking tens of thousands of applicants and we would talk with every one of them so to come in and at a decision tree. We would ask them you've been coding for 10 years. how many months have you been committing repo on a project where at least two other people were doing development work and you were pushing to production work where customers were using it at least monthly? How many months of that did you do and yeah our project and then you find a completely different number. So when we would ask much more specific questions, we could get much more accurate information about people and it allowed us to weed out and really get the strongest of the strong.

Daniel Oblinger: This is important. for a remote org. I think that there's many ways in which a remote word can be just as good as an in-person org, if you do it the right way, but you have to build a remote org as a remote org from the beginning with processes appropriate for a remote or Completely or it doesn't work. So I mean one of the problems we had was our dabs in Poland are product managers are in the US with no accent and same time zone as our customers and

Daniel Oblinger: If you missed a single requirement or single question as a 24-hour cycle because the guy would read when I don't know…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: how to do this. I got what about this? And that guy's asleep, and he's gonna wait the next day and so two or three of those cycles and you're really behind now, right and just two or three questions that you didn't get right? So a remote work needs to be a org on printed digital material much more they need to have and we're not there yet where we're not operating at the level because I don't know but I'm definitely seen, a minus something like that for my previous work. We were really good at it. We would kick the crap out of other teams. We were a consulting or we would take the crap out of internal teams and other Consulting works.

Daniel Oblinger: Because we were so much better at delivering on time and under budget every time.

Daniel Oblinger: And it was all about our processes. So I think that the key thing about that is really that you have appropriately written processes and you have the right people to do those processes. So we would have program managers who were software developers. We actually would give them a software programming test even though they're not going to program we work and…

00:35:00

Oliver Andersson: 

Daniel Oblinger: never but the reason we did it and we didn't require the same level of performance that we did out of our programmers but there's no programmer in the room with this guy when he's talking to the customer so they need to design enough and they need to know enough to ask all the right questions. So he doesn't miss any questions so that he can give a fully formed idea to the development team and then we hired pretty senior folks remotely because they're in their living room working on this they're not next to the guy. So if you're a junior guy you can lean over and ask

Daniel Oblinger: Question, but if you're in another place, you could do pair programming. I've done it you can do pair programming. through a Google meet. it's not as bad as you'd think it's very weird because you both put your thing on mute. You put your screen up. And then I can just unmute and I can say something you'll hear it because we're there and we both are seeing the other person screen all the time, but it's weird. You're gonna check your email. I want to see that happened and it's also just like if you're just go to the bathroom or whatever, it's kind of weird that in an office setting if we were sitting next to each other I went to the bathroom, so it's not that private that I just went to the bathroom, but somehow when you're on a chat, it's not the same.

Daniel Oblinger: And so It's Tricky. So there's written materials a key lack and that sort of thing. I live in slack and stand-ups need to be the right way. So the trick is to get the standups so that people talk about the right stuff. And we also do our stand-ups which are getting to be pretty good the computer vision side.

Daniel Oblinger: We each go through in about a half an hour. It should be a little bit tighter than that a summary of what they're doing and then every day or every other day, we will talk about a topic. that needs to brainstorming on it and

Daniel Oblinger: we don't have quite as much pushback as I would want. We've got three of us on the team who will basically have opinions and push back and others that are more quiet. But they're smart enough not to be quiet. I'm not quite sure. I want more on that. So I don't know that it's about in person that I'm not sure that if it was in person that would like if we were, A room. I'm not sure maybe at the Whiteboard. Maybe I'm not quite sure. there's a social Dynamic there. It's more than it is. I think an actual

Daniel Oblinger: Blockage because at least if you can all get on, a Google meet instantly, I will do a Google meet for five minutes. No problem just to get face to face.

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: I almost always do face. I want to talk somebody because why not and you can share screen, so I'm not sure that it's that but I have to admit there is still an issue there and if you didn't have daily standups people wouldn't know Each other's doing because you don't hit each other in the coffee, there's not the water cooler kind of thing. And so you really do have an issue around that.

Oliver Andersson: do you tend to ask them directly then if some people are quiet ask for their opinion or

Daniel Oblinger: yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: I will do that, especially what we're doing is yesterday this Fireball thing came through and…

Oliver Andersson: yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: so now Jason wants this is a priority and so then Juan I'm kind of like a little too shooting from the hip here and yeah, I'm gonna put this together and one like if we're gonna build a dispatcher for our team, it's gonna really run. This is the first one of all we should design this for a minute. I'm like, all right one, let's design it now grabs this meeting with Kevin design or figure it out in 10 minutes and we'll be done because I agree with him that we should design it. but I don't want to slow down And so yesterday he and I spoke for three hours. I would say it various times where you pushed back yet. His idea one is one who really push on me and I will really push on you very few others will in the CV team do that to that degree. Maybe that was a little efficient on the other hand. I think we came up with a really good design

00:40:00

Daniel Oblinger: For hours, it's written up today. He presented it to the team. And at the end because speak now or forever hold your peace. I want us to feel good about this and if there's any issues at the end, I'm trying to get people and they're kind of being quite like, Martin, what do you think? and I'm getting So people just gave the little thumbs up on there. so you get consensus there I would say we just don't get open debate as much but it's really a person by person basis. if I talk to other people, one-on-one I can get heavy debate and no you're wrong, kind of thing, which is good. Actually, I think the more the people just bluntly say you're wrong is as a healthy thing for a remote organ in general because otherwise

Oliver Andersson: I mean it leads to discourse.

Daniel Oblinger: Elite yeah, and it leads to understanding that we're not on the same page because otherwise you can mistakenly believe that you're on the same page and you're not so actually it's an interesting thing about being remote is different cultures are very different about that. I have some anecdotes I could share but I to kind of know I have to triangulate on the person to know. this is not a person who's going tell me if they disagree so I have to really probe or is this other people even if they work for me, it's still like you could do that but it would be stupid. I was one of my favorite quotes from somebody and it's like okay now I know when we're on the same page when we're not right which is much better for my point of view. I've got a thick skin. I would much rather somebody just be vehement and they're disagreement than to not be clear about their disagreement.

Oliver Andersson: And just to be clear. I know we have coders in Argentina. Where else are coders located or…

Daniel Oblinger: Yep.

Oliver Andersson: the ones that you oversee?

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah, so at this point I pretty much oversee them all at least indirectly. mostly in Argentina is where a good fraction of them are I've never done this before my previous companies have had Europe and Eastern Europe have really been where I could get cheap good developers. And so that's where I focused and when I came into this company, we have a recruiting firm and we had a couple good people from

Daniel Oblinger: South America and shockingly we found some good Engineers talking to me got some good Engineers who were trained in computer vision, which I just didn't expect that kind of depth. It's difficult to find Specialists that are not in the Bay Area and…

Oliver Andersson: Okay.

Daniel Oblinger: they're not in the US and we did I don't think you can find a ton but they're there once I saw that I had that I leaned into it because of time zone because of locality it's better. So now I try to do Latin America First in my hiring I swayed the whole sea Suite they were much more centric. I'm like man dude, we can't afford this stuff. it's just we don't have enough money and we never do we would just rather have twice the number of people so I actually think that my stance is very Global and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: and I've kind of swayed the sea sweet towards that you because

Daniel Oblinger: Is of results basically but we do have a key guy. My strongest computer vision guy is actually in Poland. I've pulled in from three companies now and…

Oliver Andersson: Okay.

Daniel Oblinger: so he's on the team. So it really makes our stand up a little bit of a bite because especially on Friday, he's going out with his kids at 6 PM. that's it 9:00 am my time. And so if we're gonna do our Sprint planning and we're gonna do our stand-ups, it needs to be 6 AM or 7 AM We're going to do that. So the overlap is a challenge there.

Oliver Andersson: Okay.

Daniel Oblinger: But we had some guys in Canada. We had some people in the US and in a number of different places and really we have played people in the lead for the computer vision team is in Mexico and we have some guys in Uruguay. So we have people around there it is

Oliver Andersson: So it is pretty I've more spread out than I thought.

Daniel Oblinger: it is spread out. That's right. and there's no bias towards Argentina. There is a bias towards the Americas and a bias. I would say probably towards South America Yeah.

Oliver Andersson: It's interesting too since I mean, it's some overlapping with time zones, which means that you can essentially extend the business day, too. But if someone leaves for work someone else can take over. I don't know exactly…

Daniel Oblinger: in practice,…

Oliver Andersson: if that's the in theory but not necessarily in projects.

00:45:00

Daniel Oblinger: it's more of a a positive for a Dev organization. it's a little bit positive for operations…

Oliver Andersson: Okay.

Daniel Oblinger: because you can cover a bit more range. But really you just want as much overlap as you can have naturally. when I had my Philippine team in the last company when you got hired by us. You just knew you were gonna work you as ours. So if you…

Oliver Andersson: Okay.

Daniel Oblinger: if you joined with us, you worked all night, and that was just the way that the company ran but that is a thing that Filipinos are used to in many jobs. And so it's kind of like, okay we do that. No other country is really willing to do that. Generally so you might don't think you can generally do that and it's better not to if you can.

Oliver Andersson: I would like to move on and ask you a little bit more a strategic question and how this technology play parting to the strategy aspect of the business. And if it's the technology that's driving business strategic decisions or if it's the That's driving the technology decisions.

Daniel Oblinger: Just want to make sure there's two levels you could mean that you could be talking about Technologies like slack and Google meet as in technology that you use to use the business or you could be talking about computer vision Technologies, like deep learning versus, customer need in volleyball versus basketball. So do you mean at the level of the Technologies we're building?

Oliver Andersson: the higher

Daniel Oblinger: That I see the technology. We're using got it. Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: In almost every up I've been that's not true, in most startups. the propeller heads like me think it's all about technology. But it's almost always about customer and customer need. That and access to the customer and cost of customer acquisition that for most companies. Those are the reasons you're going to die, which is so sad for those propellerheads like me who come in thinking I just great ideas gonna be amazing and then it just crashes and burns and the reason the question Burns is nothing to do with the part that you thought was amazing and nothing to do with your role actually and had to do it the way that you get to the market and had to do with what the market wants it. so that is like

Daniel Oblinger: unbelievably undervalued by almost every This startup is fairly unique in that first. We have a CEO really knows that and is deeply like he's a technology guy, but he's really, a customer guy first and in a way that I'm close enough to it that I'm not it and I'm close enough to it to know that you better really have it. I would never join a startup. I didn't feel like

Daniel Oblinger: Had a kick ass access to Market and understanding of a market they don't have it. I don't want to be there…

Oliver Andersson: but

Daniel Oblinger: because doesn't matter how good I am. It's not gonna go but that all said,…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: I think that Sports Physio it's trying to do this thing, which is very Tech forward don't have Sports analytics generally, there's this whole category of computer vision algorithms that are now commodity and they're changing by the month with the stuff that's coming out right now in the generative AI space is just crazy what you can do relative to what you could do six months ago. so

Daniel Oblinger: this is this magic window that do open up where a technology becomes viable but has not yet been capitalized on and now, it's not the first guy in the door that wins exactly. But the first guy in the door is more likely to get the funding rounds to get more to be moving faster in the winners win more and losers lose more and so it is this moment. and so this business

Daniel Oblinger: Is our ability to get funding our main Sapphire Ventures that basically funded us on a meeting with me. And Jason is like

Daniel Oblinger: and then when they gave us the money there comment was yeah, you guys had the sizzle but you had to meet in the pan too. There's these things a lot of startups out there that are sports startups and they have access to the market. They have all these things but they don't actually just talking b*** about AI I think don't actually have a team that's capable of delivering innovation in that area and you guys do and it was interesting and they're right about that but it's interesting though. It was like blah blah. I can tell he didn't really care that much about it or even know it that deeply they just do it enough to be able to smell legit in with legit background doing legit s***, but then it's like okay, but now tell me how you get to the market and then they care about all that stuff right? And so I thought, coming into that meeting that why I need to be there and

00:50:00

Daniel Oblinger: ever gonna, fund us and they did and it turned out that I was very important that I was in the meeting or at least that they came away with that feeling and I think that they're thinking is spot on that in this area if you have access to the market and you have products and such but You don't actually build full AI that can actually do stats or do some part of the problem. Then you're just among the masses and you might get some market share and such but the one who can really do that. They're gonna just be able to get market share that nobody else can get to right and they're gonna blow up and so I think this is the case where this business drives on actually having both. And I don't think that's true for The most most startups can get by with.

Daniel Oblinger: some good engineering but nothing special there, but they can't get by with some good access to the market and good understanding the market. They need excellent access to the market and excellent understanding the bark. This one needs excellent on both.

Oliver Andersson: Again, thank you.

Oliver Andersson: who is in moving on to the processes and data governance who is involved in making new processes? And also I know we could cover it a little bit and who brings in the new ideas and what does that process look like for coming up with new ideas. I mean know you might see the stand up meetings. For the technology part.

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah.

Oliver Andersson: Do you have any other similar process or that's the one?

Daniel Oblinger: No, so I think you asked several questions in a row there as far as where the ideas come from. I'll answer it specific to the computer vision team, but then I want to address it larger.

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: the process is very much like our

Daniel Oblinger: Let me get this The process and this really came from Sean and I love it. I had never really used a process quite like this before. This is my Q2 okr?

Daniel Oblinger: and it's what we're supposed to deliver in the next three months. And this is very top-down but it's like payday is baseball. Then IP that patents were doing we've got some core Innovations in this middle area here. We've got some infrastructure storing whether we're doing for IP and then I've got a bunch of other products that we could do AI minutes and I've got a bunch of these experiments that let me assess how well it would matter to the business. If we were to able to do shotbox or Halos or these different product ideas that have come out. So this is very top-down, but we're in it and it came from me mostly but it's really very bottom up where each of these things came from and it's also like Sean is telling me man shot charts would really so for example, Sean just said to me, in sidebar. Hey,

Daniel Oblinger: We're focused on all these things that make players really excited but I need stuff that's gonna make a coach excited because I need to sell to the coach. and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: I don't have much to get him right now because I got highlights but he's the most highlights. So what am I doing is but shot charts plus minus those are valuable things, for analytics that we can sell, business around so I hear that I'm like, okay, I need to prioritize that all right. so those ideas are coming from everywhere, but mostly I would say I'm very attentive to what sales and what the CEO says is the vision of the company. I'm a soldier and that's my marching orders come from there. And so that's really where this is coming from but then

Daniel Oblinger: It's very much. a lot of Bottoms Up On the details of ideas that are coming together. So in fact in the meetings the thing that I've done a good job in is we have good Engineers who are strong enough that they can take a problem. we need Fair where they are in the court geometrically where they are on the court and researchers have looked at that 15 different ways to Tuesday and they can go out and literature and read papers and figure out one and download some code and try it out. And so they're really optimized for that kind of quick. Try it out stuff. So most of the specific ideas

00:55:00

Daniel Oblinger: at least more than half are not coming from inside my head. They're really from the team ideas or bubbling up everywhere and I'm just trying to assess them. I can squint my eyes at it and have an idea about whether I think it's got a chance or doesn't have a chance. But even if I disagree with them, I may let them do some days on it to prove me wrong kind of thing, as long as it's quick enough, so it's very much Bottoms Up in terms of ideas And that sort of thing and processes, across software. I view myself as kind of like

Daniel Oblinger: Trying to generate processes but just Sue has brought in a lot of processes around jira tickets and…

Oliver Andersson: Okay.

Daniel Oblinger: stuff. And that's really from her. And Jack really came up with this game plan every two week thing that he generates and I was pushing to do something but I didn't do that. And so a lot of times processes are really, not coming, they're coming from somebody who just does it and that's kind of what you need and start a plan is people who do just kind of do it as long as they're not

Daniel Oblinger: Off the farm. they don't go off for a long time and spend a bunch of hours on something and they don't even know Im Don't do that to me. But what about this, kind of thing and all things equal if I can agree with something that came from somebody else or edited a little bit. I'd much rather do that because they're gonna get much more buy-in. I think there's three loci…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: where ideas are coming in though. I think one of them is Sean has his world where ideas come in completely different set of ideas, but probably the most important to the company or among the most important is which physically be in how should we be framing this? I think there's another whole where ideas come from that are coming up from operations and product Jack and James. We're like, this is the way you would want to provide this information or here's how we would do this so they do the whole set of ideas that are coming up that way and I think that there's

Daniel Oblinger: on the software infrastructure side. There's a lot of ideas about how to do things which language and framework to use and I'm less In touch with exactly how those are happening, but I know that Double T is bringing ideas in on how you do things on the front end. Scott is very opinionated about how you bring in things on the back end and one of the new things there and there you mostly just want to ride herd and make sure that we're not Engineers love their fancy gadgets. You just need to make sure that they're not spending way too much time.

Daniel Oblinger: On their fancy Gadget, but in general you want to allow the ideas to come from, where they come from and…

Oliver Andersson: that takes us

Daniel Oblinger: I think a good suite is operating where I need to deliver technology. That's what I need to own that and I need to just take orders from Sean's org and Sean just needs to basically run the experiments and do the analysis and move the company in the right way and Jason needs to move the investors in the right way and we in the sea Suite kind of just listen to each Other in their area of expertise trust them implicitly and kind of take orders in a way all the way around. That's the way I think it should work and I think largely this company is working the way it should work.

Oliver Andersson: thank you.

Oliver Andersson: We talked a little bit that you're a very good at hiring software Developers. One topic that we covered in our class is that They have the CPA. they can get finest people they have the CFA statisticians have their stats certification they can get How do you determine …

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah, I hear you loud and clear. right

Oliver Andersson: what a good quality like a good software developer is and just what's that countability the software developers have because in today's age you have generative Ai and they could generate the code that they're not 100% Sure. How it works. But as long as it passes through it seems like it's fine.

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah.

Oliver Andersson: Our professor has been saying all suffered developers.'s like almost there is accountability to that job code for x amount of hours. There's no accountability really if anything goes wrong. And then that's it. And I told them I sounds like software development is the best job because I can just work and I have no accountability.

01:00:00

Daniel Oblinger: Right a badly run software org has no accountability. Remember I've rolled off most people and hired a bunch of people in here. So there's accountability, …

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: so there should be accountability in a software org and even though there aren't standardized tests and I do agree with your professor that

Daniel Oblinger: We don't have Touchstone tests like you have in accountancy in other areas like that and thus it's harder for a hiring manager to make good choices, but there is objectively better and worse software engineering and one can measure it. Absolutely and I'm a big believer in the way that you do. That is I want to bring up one of my test problems here the way that you do that is if I want to assess somebody doing a problem then I want to test them on a task which is as close as possible to the real task that they will do.

Daniel Oblinger: Actually, no matter what they're doing. So I came over eight years of this one company. I have one company where I kind of did other companies in between and is your owner while the other co-founder was kind of in the weeds with it. So I stayed with it for a long time over that long time. We really got good at hiring and when we would hire we have a new role he and I would sit down and we get our coffee or get a beer and just if this person was amazing. What would they be able to do that other people couldn't do what they were amazing at this job.

Daniel Oblinger: And we would list out those things. We try to get really granular. what would differentiate somebody who was amazing for somebody who's good at this job? Because remember we're trying to hire one out of 500, right? So we're really aiming for amazing and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: so we would think about that and kind of come up with those things and that's how we would build that decision tree at the front. So the way we did it was we had a decision to read the front where we could ask some triage questions exclude 90% of the applicants they don't have the relevant experience for a startup if you want somebody to do jobx. They have to have experience doing job it's just very difficult to come in the drawer and train up. And so I think it's a challenging theme for junior folks to get going in that world. Now a lot of startups are

Daniel Oblinger: not well-funded and so they get Junior people in because that's all they can afford but the problem is then you got a junior person in an org without Role Models there and now it's difficult for them to actually learn, to improve so startups are actually a tough World in general, but they are a fun world and you do put a bunch of hats on as opposed to getting really siled when you go into a big Coast so It's pluses to learning but in any case, how do we hire here? I'll show

Daniel Oblinger: the first stage in our process was this Second stage was an online test. So for a bucket test, I could give you a two or three hour coding exercise where in a browser you would do a little puzzly problem, for 30 minutes. I'll give you two or three of them and I can watch you edit. So it's little tricky for you to cut and paste you couldn't paste. I'm gonna That happening because I can see a history of your edits as you use this tool now you can get somebody else to take the test for you. So it's not foolproof. and they go out of their way to find problems. You can't find online. This was pre-chat GPT. So when the chat GPT World it might be harder to use this kind of test. But anyway that test was a nice triage, so I would knock out another.

Daniel Oblinger: Two-thirds or three quarters of the applicants then we would look at the resumes so notice my lead team didn't even look at the resumes…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: until we actually got through those first two hurdles, and I already weeded out. 95% of the applicants now, I'm really looking at your history and are you the person for this kind of a job this look good? And then we would do one or two interviews. And then if it looked good I would give you one of these. So this is one that I did for computer vision for every job. We would come up with a spec and this is the grading rubric. How are we deciding whether or not somebody how they did?

01:05:00

Daniel Oblinger: This is how you execute the steps because I want to give this to somebody in the Philippines to do for me so I don't have to focus on this and then here's the email number one. Congratulations on demonstrating strong proficiency blah. You can see it's really spelled out. This is the email you're gonna send this person. Telling them what's going to happen here. Basically, we give them an empty GitHub repo I give him this spec. this is the email one is before the test even begins just so what's gonna happen, it's about opencv. So make sure you've looked at that package because I don't want somebody to fail the test just from Basics here. And then what we would do is pay them because I'm gonna ask you now to do, amount of work I pay you for a weekend's worth of work two four hours stints basically and then

Daniel Oblinger: Here I would just give you an empty GitHub repo tell you to say I'm ready and then I would email you the spec of the problem and then you would say, received so I know for sure when you began the test and I can watch you commit to the repo which I tell you. You must do repeatedly during your development work. So every hour wherever you're at, I don't care what it is. Just commit. You just checking you can use whatever you want…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: because when you're working for me, you can use check EBT news. You want I don't care. I'm gonna give you a hard enough problem that in the weekend. I'm gonna blow your doors off even with tattoo, So I set the problem up here where I can a plus Still has room where they couldn't do everything and a c player was able to do a little bit. Right or maybe a b player because that's really the range. I'm aiming to basically measure that range.

Daniel Oblinger: And it's an empty GitHub repo. It's a fairly ambitious task. Here's what the task is. Here's the deliverables down to everything. I try to make it so that the deliverables are executables so that I don't have to do anything. I can just look at what you did, right?

Daniel Oblinger: And most of them have a stretch task most of them have if you did all that then do this too, And so, this task was do a non-trivial part of the computer vision problem. Right? So the whole point is I want to hire people are gonna be good at the computer vision so you can talk good talk but you got an empty GitHub repo and I gave you a hard problem and you have four hours get busy baby. So this test this is my answer to the professor. This is how I can tell the difference because somebody who's not a good engineer who's really up to speed with it and do this. I would say the limitation of this test is if you're really smart and in three months you could be really effective for me you able to test

Oliver Andersson: he

Daniel Oblinger: but this is a startup. I don't have time for three months and you're going to be and so in some sense this test is a pretty good test for who I'm trying to hire.

Oliver Andersson: this is a test. You've created yourself. Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: Exactly with great pain and great work. So as a c sweeter. My job. Number one is the people that work for me. And so I need to put a lot of time in I got a lot of pushback everywhere. I got pushed back from the CEO. I got push back from everybody. You're not moving fast enough, you gotta even people in but you got to get good people and it takes time to do it. But once you kind of get the rhythm of it and as long as before you need the person that you're gonna need the person you can spend the time to do this and Six months later. I have no more pushback when I say I want to create one of these tests. We've got a whole process. No one says anything they're like that's of course the way you're supposed to do it,…

Oliver Andersson: And this is like you create multiple tests.

Daniel Oblinger: So just because the results have been good. Yeah.

Oliver Andersson: This is not just fantastic you use for everyone you keep contin creating new ones.

Daniel Oblinger: Her role. so that's what we did.

Oliver Andersson: Wow.

Daniel Oblinger: This is the process that Nick and I and my previous company came to we would get a beer we would sit down and the first question we ask ourselves was imagine the most amazing person and somebody who's really good sitting next to each other. What is it the Healing person can do the really good person can't do what is it that really and what are the key things this person needs to do not the nice to have but what are the things that they really are going to knock it out of the park if they can do these things and once we've enumerated those things then it's a question of now. What can we do to elicit?

01:10:00

Daniel Oblinger: That so We've done that for operational roles. We've done that for call center people that are going to basically do ops. We've done that for computer vision. I did that when I get a robotics for phds who are doing robotics. Basically, this is my Mo now is basically I want to figure out who would be the amazing person. How do I assess that? And then how do I turn that into a test? Yep.

Oliver Andersson: So that's super cool. That's a great answer. Would you use? sorry, I lost my trailer thoughts and

Daniel Oblinger: Okay.

Oliver Andersson: that is super cool.

Oliver Andersson: I should probably just move on and How is information used to drive decisions ask for CEO like what? Are you specifically looking for when you're trying to make decisions?

Daniel Oblinger: We are. In our infancy on this, I think startups are always light on. Formal analytics and data for decision making and they should be because they need to move fast, which means you got to go with your gut. to know you got to be able to move fast enough, but

Daniel Oblinger: want to use your gut as little as possible, even though you really need to do that. You don't be lazy. Don't be using your gut when you could get the data to make a decision and if you can delay a bit and get the data to actually make the decision you should do that, but only a bit. and so, I think that

Daniel Oblinger: there isn't a one-size-fits all answer to that question because the number of different decisions that a company like Sports Physio is making is so crazy different that some of them you can actually get pretty numeric. It's like on the computer vision side, which algorithm are we using that's the place where you can really get down to we design metrics and we measure and we do leave one out cross validation on the training and you can do a lot of real data-driven stuff there and we're still not doing nearly as much as we Should and a lot of it is you really have to build the processes where?

Daniel Oblinger: since I've been there, we now have a team. I've got one guy in the Philippines so I can call on to do some data gather stuff for me and kind of my guy Friday from my previous company. I pulling him along and he's really good at

Daniel Oblinger: Left field data gather I want to find somebody who's done grasping research go around the world and find all the conferences that would do this kind of stuff find all of the research areas find all of the universities where it happens find all the top Publishers by who they are in Cross these criss cross these lists, And so you build this plan for how you're gonna do this big data gather and then, do that and so I think you can really use lower cost labor and do kind of very good data gather and I'm actually good at that again from that previous company. we have trained Ops Team…

Oliver Andersson: English

Daniel Oblinger: who basically knew to do data gather

Daniel Oblinger: Right and so we can ask them go do this and do right and I've got a little bit of that now especially with my guy Friday around we also have data gather. We've got a team in Columbia who does data annotation. This is very much in computer vision because when you data gather like you want to be able to predict jersey numbers, I thought this would be much easier problem than it is to accurately do that with low resolution stuff is not all easy. And so we actually that's very low level technical data gather for computer vision,…

Oliver Andersson: 

Daniel Oblinger: and we use teams there and it's complicated and so we have a whole process around How We Do how we task them and get the data back we're doing of course data gather. Now that Sean is here. I think we're leveling up.

Daniel Oblinger: Very rapidly in the way that we do data gather around sales. I'm not the person to really speak to that but I see that we're doing a bunch of it. And yeah.

01:15:00

Oliver Andersson: I think that would be me.

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah doing that. It's a you would know right, more than I know but I would say that we went from the minor leagues, to the major leagues I think in bringing Sean in just so the level of sophistication and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: and I feel like Sean is also pretty good at

Daniel Oblinger: Shooting from the hip and just having an opinion and not collecting the data and just knowing yeah, it's just not were whereas but then on the other hand to really collect the data when he needs to right and to be data first, Don't shoot from the hip, when you could collect data and have a more informed decision. And so I think we're leveling up in that area pretty dramatically. but I think we end up with even here for my end of Q2. I want to have these crossover experiments. So I've got some experimental designs that kind of like from psychology where I'm going to give annotators a fancy tool and no fancy tool and then switch it.

Daniel Oblinger: So the two weeks later you annotate the game without the tool with the fancy tool and directly measure. What's the performance Improvement of the fancy tool? So I'm doing mock-ups of products that I don't yet have in order to assess the value of them. So again, I shouldn't be listening to anybody on the team including myself those opinion about those things. I should measure them when I can't so I think whenever you can get all the way down to data you should

Oliver Andersson: That's super cool. I remember when I was gonna ask you earlier.

Daniel Oblinger: yeah.

Oliver Andersson: So regarding the hires you make since you have that hard process and it really challenged everyone. How's the turnover been? Because I'm guessing the turnover rate would be incredibly low since everyone that you get is qualified for job. Obviously some turnover happens naturally,…

Daniel Oblinger: right right

Oliver Andersson: but in terms of in qualified turnover, I'm assuming it's been very very low.

Daniel Oblinger: yeah, I mean so it's so Short now that I have been here and doing this that I think we've had. No turnover, but it's just such a short period I don't think that proves anything. I would say that my turnover rate. At analytics fire really is proof in the pudding. It was very low and we Early on did have some challenges where we had to let somebody go after, a couple of months kind of thing.

Oliver Andersson: Okay.

Daniel Oblinger: And I think it's a failure. I think that you should do this whole fancy process, but even at the end of that fancy process,

Daniel Oblinger: I would say one-third of the people that we hire we're still not awesome Remember we were looking for amazing people so you could be good and still not make it in that org. And so what I've Come Away with is a very strong opinion. it's your responsibility as the hiring person to have the task that they're going to work on day one Define and completely ready to go.

Daniel Oblinger: On day minus one before they get there. And so that when they show up there's a task which they don't have to wait on anything else. It's relatively self-contained. They don't have to learn a lot to be able to do the task and it's not too hard. I'm not looking to wash you out but I am looking to kick the tire really hard and make sure it doesn't fall off a car. So I want to give them a tough problem and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: tell them I say hey, we need to make progress on this don't even let yourself go a day if you're even, an hour and you don't know how to do something. You ask Don't the only failure here is that you don't ask so I'm really blunt about I don't want to tell them that we're gonna fire you if you don't do well on this that's just true harsh but I don't want to totally hide it from them that hey you need to perform on this because they do and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: basically what the failure mode that I saw before is

Daniel Oblinger: We would have legitimate excuses why they didn't perform well on their first task because we weren't prepared. And so then we couldn't be sure when they didn't do. if it was because of setting them know and then it took several months to realize no it's not actually working and it's just not good for anybody. And so we really do my view is you should know in three weeks of this person is gonna be good. and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: then you shouldn't have turnover and if you have turnover. I mean It can be because you're gonna start up and they just get a job. That's double the salary. It's at analytics fire when we sold the business one of the reasons we sold it was.

01:20:00

Daniel Oblinger: Way our model really worked on a lot of companies that were Outsourcing we're now in sourcing and they were saying hey, we just hire people directly and so we were basically getting out competed by the people that were our customers and they could of course. Higher at twice the rate that we could and…

Oliver Andersson: for it

Daniel Oblinger: so we couldn't touch it. And so, at an analyst fire we had very very low turnover until the end started picking up and we could see the writing on the wall.

Daniel Oblinger: But that's a lot about you making it be a fun place to work. Especially For Engineers. if they're good.

Oliver Andersson: 

Daniel Oblinger: They can work wherever the heck they want. Right and 20% more salary ain't worth it if they're not having fun. And so you really have to pay a lot of attention to that and the cool thing is for high performing people having fun is actually delivering. So it's not that you have to make it easy, right? You just have to make sure that you get s* out our way so they can get stuff done and that you're not like Great yanking around in various ways which is difficult to do when you still have to deliver things fast, but the art is to not yank them around and still deliver things fast.

Oliver Andersson: It's super cool. You've mentioning things that we've discussed in my management class as well Mike with what makes a high performing organization and…

Daniel Oblinger: .

Oliver Andersson: but organization or people are drawn to high performing organizations, but if they're not happy where they're working. They're gonna be looking elsewhere.

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah.

Oliver Andersson: What do you have to do in order to maintain the hyper performing people?

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah, I mean I can definitely say that things that matter. I think achieving them is an art that I'm okay at I've seen people who are like I learned from my co-founder at analytics fire. he was in tune with that mentality and he worried about things I didn't worry about and I just came to realize over time. Those are the things to worry about and so I feel like I've grown in my ability to do this, but I'm still not a master at it. I think a couple of things. One of them is Engineers want to learn and so if they do not feel like they're learning new things then.

Daniel Oblinger: They correctly recognize that this job isn't actually growing their career and they should be thinking about being somewhere else. And I think just if you're the kind of person who wants to be an engineer and it kind of person who wants to learn stuff anyway, so I think both for rational reasons and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: just DNA reasons so you need to make sure that that's true in your organ. it's a dance because you don't want to be bringing in all the fanciest tools, and have your org all over the place, but you want to let people grow and move and we have brown bag, discussions when we would have all hands and my previous company would have a hackathon which I couldn't believe people.

Daniel Oblinger: Job was coding that they would want to have a hackathon when they went to Prague but that's what they wanted to do. So we did so I think there's things that you can do in that direction in addition to learning Engineers like certainty and so you really want an organization that I'm gonna get paid this is gonna keep going tasks are not gonna pivot around you're not gonna change the middle of the Sprint just know what's going to happen next much more than I need as a founder and a startups. I'm kind of used to like chaos is I'm a very weird bird in that I'm

Daniel Oblinger: Thrive on chaos at the same time. I'm kind of an engineer's mind, but I recognize we did a Myers-Briggs one time with our team and the two co-founders were over here. Everybody else was over there We're always the same Engineers actually not and so I recognize that that's actually a pretty important. Certainty and continuity is very high and I would say just non-toxic. Environment where people just feel they can kind of let their hair down is important and I would say ownership is very very important. Everybody wants to own something and so you really want to try to build an org where people do feel ownership and that's a very tricky.

01:25:00

Daniel Oblinger: Art because you got to get the right level and get the right thing there and set them up in the right way but it's really key. So those are some of the ingredients I know the ingredients and I have a few trips and tricks for how to do them. But I think it's an art to doing that. Yeah.

Oliver Andersson: It's brief explaining a real world example for my management class this super cool. I know we're heading towards the end of our scheduled time.

Daniel Oblinger: 

Oliver Andersson: Could I ask you one more question and…

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah.

Oliver Andersson: then we wrap it up?

Oliver Andersson: Another topic we've covered in our class is about missing data.

Oliver Andersson: many companies are only concerned with what data is being tracked, but they fail to think critically about data that is not being tracked. And what's your experience with missing data?

Daniel Oblinger: 

Daniel Oblinger: yeah, I think that question comes from a big Co mindset where Everything's tracked and you've got processes that have been in place for decades. And if you're tracking everything inside of a retail organization or something like that. And so then the question is what's not tracked right a startup and there's another wrong with that perspective, but I can kind of hear the perspective in the question a startup.

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: Nothing was drafted, So everything was missing right? And so, you're starting from this place where you don't have data. And so you can still ask the question. What about the missing data? it's all missing right? And so for me, I think the way that I think about this and I think it is a pretty rational way to think about it is

Daniel Oblinger: What are the questions that we need to get the answers right such that if we get the answers wrong to these questions, we're the crater I was talking about right and…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: and those questions we need to really get right and since we don't have a lot of time and we don't have a lot of money we have to basically put our limited time and money around those questions, so it's not so much about Missing data that's sort of implies to a lot of data and I see one column is missing here, but it's rather. Start from the end of what is it? That's going to make this company go. And what are the Choice points and decisions that need to be made in order to do that? And then you ask the question. that's what it is. for example,

Daniel Oblinger: I need to know how the customers gonna respond in different markets to you access to different ideas of different products that we could deliver but then I've got some other complicated thing that I also need to know that the computer vision is actually gonna be able to do it because it doesn't matter if we have a great market for this thing. I can't build right because we're so far on the bleeding edge a lot of things that we can Envision you can't build them accurately enough that they'll actually work. So I actually have together data on both sides in this thing in this dance, And so I think it's first shifting which questions do I need answered most critically and then am I in a good position so it's a little bit like missing data, but it's really just I mean good position to what's the best way to answer that question and in particular is their data that I could use to answer it and I think this is kind of getting to the spirit of a question.

Daniel Oblinger: You shouldn't really be overly focused on the data that you happen to have in front of you. If that doesn't turn out to be the data that you need in order to answer the question. And so in that way it's missing data and that you need to go and you need to get this kind of data to do that. And so you really should when you get down to the point of the question that you want to answer. you really should be asking yourself. What is the best way to answer this question most authoritatively the least likely to have fooled yourself and often Gathering data is the least likely way to fool yourself and then you can kind of see that as missing data right the data that would be necessary there. But I think the trick there is it's so easy to Envision data that you could love to have it's just way too costly to get to and…

Oliver Andersson: Get to acquire.

Daniel Oblinger: so yeah. Yes, you have to basically most the time when you ask that you ask this meaty question.

Daniel Oblinger: And then you're like, is there any data and then the natural data would be data. That's just totally unobtainable for you. It's these days. Is there any proxy to this get some data that somehow gives me a proxy to this thing I care about and then you get creative and then that's how you get your data and answer your question and absolutely what you should be doing as a suite person.

01:30:00

Oliver Andersson: I think The way we've been talking about it this for example.

Daniel Oblinger: Welcome.

Oliver Andersson: and using the player impact model that Jack has developed as an example There are different metrics and variables that are accounted in that model. But then for example one person had and I'm really had an impact on the game. But their performance isn't accounted for since that variable was subtract and being the model is still one output based on certain rules, but then when everyone else who played that game called to himself like hey, no this for sure was the best player but just those variables wasn't connected to so I think that's more sort of the view and mindset that we had going into with regardless questions and…

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah, yeah.

Oliver Andersson: What's not being tracked in that sense? And I think you answered amazingly.

Daniel Oblinger: and it's interesting because that particular thing is in some sense of value to our business in so much as players value the answer that we got back and so doing a really good job on that can help sell the product. My experience actually is that when you have a metric like that that's being tracked. It has value.

Daniel Oblinger: As soon as you have a measure like humans are just very like there's a number and I got an eight and you'll have seven mine's eight, what is never coming doesn't matter. I gotta meet so in some sense,…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: and be putting a suite hat on. I'm like of all the things I need to get right in building my model I do Okay job on that. That's kind of a good feature. But actually I would already be asking a meta question which is what proxies can I use to assess how much it matters in terms of selling the product that we have a measure the secondary thing would even be that the measures any good. Right? I mean I would probably just use the tried and true ways of just surveying people who have been exposed to the number and say yeah, do you believe the number do you like it is valuable to you kind of thing to assess the number rather than doing any formal about the accur.

Daniel Oblinger: Of that number I would just be like because when I care about mostly just being a grizzled skeptical old, startup guys like okay, whatever and it's nice, that's cool. But really what I care about is that it actually sell product here and then I care about how did people perceive it. Is actually more important to me than how accurate was it, right? But I mean there's other places where those are more tightly correlated in The annotation world. Did you actually get the right jersey number when you said who made the shot? is that or your stats accurate? So there you can measure accuracy and

Daniel Oblinger: Our requirements are notably higher and they're notably more objective. There's a right and a wrong answer to that. And so there we have a metric where we're tracking it and we have plenty of problems with missing data there too. So we deep inside the algorithm is …

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: how do we take an account? When we lost track of the person and the shot was made? we can see where all the other players were. So by impressive elimination. We can say this was a shooter, right so we can you…

Oliver Andersson: Yeah.

Daniel Oblinger: we can use missy we can avoid losing when we had missing data kind of at that level.

Oliver Andersson: thank you so much that for taking a time to doing this for me. I really appreciate it.

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So this is the final on your class or you're gonna basically put this in and you're done.

Oliver Andersson: For this class. Yes. I have three classes and this is the final product from one of them for one on the others.

Daniel Oblinger: Okay. I got.

Oliver Andersson: I'm analyzing operational expenses for all division one schools from 2003 to 2001 to Predicting what's the future going to be like and also see for example, I go to Gonzaga University and they're talking about switching to the Big 12 and I'm just gonna do some predictive and see how much would this be for a coffee increase for Gonzaga to make the switch?

Daniel Oblinger: I see interesting got it. and your degree is really in is it business process is it what is the degree?

01:35:00

Oliver Andersson: The name of it is business analytics. So for undergrad I did Information Systems. I did Mis and operations and now for my graduate degree, I'm doing a master of science in business Analytics.

Daniel Oblinger: Okay, got it. So it's a master's in business. not

Oliver Andersson: Yes, and that gives me some Visa advantages as well. So I get to stay in the US for three years instead of one which I would only get from a regular MBA.

Daniel Oblinger: Is that area on a standard H1?

Oliver Andersson: No, I'm on an F1 since I'm a student.

Daniel Oblinger: Right, but when you graduate for those three years. You'll be on an H1.

Oliver Andersson: Not done in my I will still be on F1. It's called optional practical training. So it would still be F1 for three years and…

Daniel Oblinger: 

Oliver Andersson: then I get to hope to find something that can extend to an H-1B.

Daniel Oblinger: I see H1 B is by Lottery but in

Oliver Andersson: And yeah, they're working Visa. Sorry, you're right.

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah, I think an H1 is easier for you to get because it's not based on a lot of you get an h1b2 but an H1 I think is actually easier for you. Assuming you get the right company to work for and my wife was on each one Forever at Walmart. You can be on each one for a long time and then finally got a green card. But yeah.

Oliver Andersson: Yeah, so, it's H1. I'm going for.

Daniel Oblinger: Got it. I see where are you from originally?

Oliver Andersson: from Stockholm Sweden

Daniel Oblinger: Okay, got it. And your goal is to hang out here afterwards. in the US

Oliver Andersson: Yes, it's easier to get a job with American degree here in the US than this week and they don't really validated. So if I were to go back to Sweden right now, I'll probably would have to study another year to just prove that. I know what I know.

Daniel Oblinger: so you came here with the idea of getting a job here and actually getting a job back there would be harder and that wasn't your goal. Your goal is really to be here.

Oliver Andersson: Yes, I came here to the US to play tennis. So I've been playing Division One tennis for Gonzaga 45 years and…

Daniel Oblinger: right

Oliver Andersson: and that I'm done. Yeah, I would like to stay for a couple years and it's easier to get a job in the US then in Sweden with this degree.

Daniel Oblinger: Got it, but swings nice place to live long-term.

Oliver Andersson: It is to have a family.

Daniel Oblinger: You want to be I see so long term you might go back to Sweden. Yeah, got it.

Oliver Andersson: Yes for sure.

Daniel Oblinger: Got it. Yeah, I see. Good luck with all that and if I can help him what some way let me know.

Oliver Andersson: Thank I'm gonna do a write-up and I will send a copy to you before I submit anything in case you want to make any changes.

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah, I don't really would be if I accidentally said something about the company that the company wouldn't want to be out there, but I don't think there's anything like that. So yeah.

Oliver Andersson: And to my understanding or I know that out it won't get posted anywhere. The only one that will see it is my professor. But still I want to make sure that I do your right to buy showing you…

Daniel Oblinger: Yeah, sure.

Oliver Andersson: what I will write.

Daniel Oblinger: Awesome. Love it.

Oliver Andersson: Thank you so much.

Daniel Oblinger: Yep, this was fun.

Oliver Andersson: Thank Have a great rest of your week, and I hope you have a great weekend. Thank you.

Daniel Oblinger: All right, Talk to you.
