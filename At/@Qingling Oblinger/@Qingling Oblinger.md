## 2025-11-03  Fireworks AI

XXXX,

My husband has been thinking about chat-based construction of agentic workflows.  Companies like mine can gain notable value from Agentic workflows, but we often don't have the Dev resources to allocate.  Dan thinks LLMs themselves could be used to drive full construction entirely via chat.

He would love to get your thoughts on this direction, especially since he thinks it is a natural extension of Fireworks existing agent offering.  He would love to chat with you about it if you have the time and interest for a coffee.

Nancy,

My husband (AI CTO/PhD) has been telling me how this "agentic AI" moment cries out for an open-standards solution where 1Password's desktop install base could allow us to come out on top.  He also has thoughts about how LLMs could "auto correct" a lot of our browser scripts w/o human labor. He is excited about this window of opportunity. I know we are already moving in these directions, still perhaps there is value in you having a conversation with him.

Let me know,
Qingling



planning for these things, still I thought it might be a useful 


as a magic window where 1Password mighand I have been talking a lot about how this agentic-AI moment is magical for 1Password.
He is super excited about it, and I thought it might be fun for you to chat with him.

is a long time 1-password fan, he has thinking alot about our move into Agentic AI, and would love to chat.

We have been talking alot about 
We talk all the time about how this Agentic-AI moment could be magical for 1password. 

He is super excited about it, and I thought it might be fun for you to caht with him.




has been talking with me for the last few weeks about this being a magical time for 1-password, as the larger community is clamoring for a new authentication solution that will allow users to share credentials across all apps and all their AI-agents.  He thinks that 1Password already has a widespread presence on desktops, which might give us a leg up in winning the adoption race.  He is now the CTO at a Computer Vision start-up, developing and scaling the latest AI algorithms.  In his career, he has been on a governmental advisory board at DARPA, developed standards with NIST, and built 5 AI-teams from scratch.  If you have time and interest, he would love to talk about 1-Password's AI strategy and whether he might fit into it.



Nancy,

My husband (Startup CTO & PhD in AI) has been talking with me for the last weeks about this being a magical time for 1-password as the larger community is clamoring for a new authentication solution that will allow users to share credentials across all apps across all their AI-agents.  He thinks the fact that 1password is already installed on many desktops might afford us a leg up in winning the adoption race.  I know our teams are already thinking hard about this problem, still I thought you might have an interest in chatting with him about these opportunities.


## t2019-00-00 - QL Notes
Incrementality:
-- Ads are not randomly provided, but aimed at good prospects boosting results
    people choose when to be advertized to
    -- randomized experiementation fixes this  (Instrumental variables)  bid level rnd
	-- num auctions won (somehow) varies by instrumental var

-- gain two values: statistical & economic.
   (spend less on stat as more accurate; "quasi-posterior of covar matrix")


AD STOCK 
-- Treat 'ad' as stock that the reducing over time.
-- Each ad has different "beta-weighted" components that affect incrementality


COMBINING WITH BIDDING STRATEGIES
-- Estimate ad value based on future incremental value obtained

BLACK BOX ESTIMATOR INPUTS:  (see page 16-17)

Fourier Series w. Dynamic Ad stock -- for time varying incremental effects

Non-additive ad stock (direct modeling of integral)

Downsampling negatives in continuous time
   (double counting issue)


continuous time easier to deal w. than batched
-- helps avoid things like reverse-causality biasing. 
   (when bid-behavior feedback is faster than incrmentatily estimating)But
