Hello Jason & Daniel,

Hope you are doing well.

I am reaching out from Google’s business development team, to see if we can introduce our Google Cloud Platform in your business. 

This link [https://googlecloudcheatsheet.withgoogle.com/](https://googlecloudcheatsheet.withgoogle.com/) contains all the GCP products where Google is providing free credits up-to $200,000. 

Lets connect for an introductory call and I will walk you through the entire program and see how these credits bring value to your business. You can schedule a meeting using the  [Appointment Scheduler](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ1X-wS40urHaaLz6c9nU4KeAX2lfvfJNccmwPS9aEzqKNbs9iyKvzuY4zB29IuIZCheeDcIW2Gp) in my calendar based on your availability.

Looking forward to this partnership.

Regards
