EXPERIENCE

No AI background.

- Built marketplaces, ecommerce sites, 
- This is like playing in the premier league

STARTED AS DEV
- Java, 


KARVI - Car sales platform
- joined employee 4 (1 dev), grew team to 400 (60 devs)
- Backend: JS, Go, Micro services, Front: Next JS, AWS
- Scale: 3M requests per-hour.  
- Algorithm:  Lowest offer, nearest offer, same model car
	- Added more rules
	- Elastic search
	- Caching
- He was the architect, then at employ 10-15 hired an architect
	- Schedule for scaling each month improve incremental
- Hired 4 PMs each had a product part
- SQUAD:  4-6 devs in each squad + PM + tech lead
- WHY LEAVE: Salary terrible, not a founder.  Reach peak at company.  
	- Promoted VP eng - 
	- Great contact w/ his boss the founder.  
	  He would say was a very good professional for 2-3 years
	  Last year was very tough.  all VC money was cut.  big layoffs 30% of company.  Stab for him to do this.
	  Create friction in daily basis:  Salary was not enough, much below 10K month.
	  - Offers were 4x of his salary.
- His best skill is team building.
- **Testing**:  Haystack situation room(pull requests)
	- TDD
	- Synthetic testing
	- Time for everything.  Fast&break things -->  Testing when you have product market fit --> Scaling
	- Kinds of tests:
		- Java & python - unit tests are great and easy.
		- integration tests - for UI and visual transactions.
- NEST.JS
	- if you don't have a gateway.
