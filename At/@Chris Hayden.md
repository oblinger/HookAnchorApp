Chris,

Good to electronically meet.  Jake has given me just a bit of context regarding this moment in time at Sunnova: a large jump in headcount, an opportunity to grow marketshare based on IRA monies, and a mandate to differentiate the product offering thru best-in-market software and AI.  Sounds exciting.

At your convenience I would enjoy hearing your vision for the organization going forward with an eye towards value that I might bring into that picture.

Thanks,
Dan
