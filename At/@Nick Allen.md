- Think I want AI-team reporting to me, wonder if I want SW reporting to me
- DONT want product details reporting up thru me.
- DO want ownership of specific gaps (in technical product spec, and architecture)


- MY Value on AI side

	- Driving tempo
- MY Gap on AI side

### 2023-04-04 Navigating the choppy waters.


Subj: 


Navigating the choppy waters at Sports Visio


I think I am appreciated at Sports Visio by many including Jason.  Still Jason is quite Machiavellian... Perhaps just a bit like Jake.

I think (thought?) I have have 'credits' to my name, but recently have started seeing some writing on the wall that seems BAD.

Big picture:
- Jason and others thinks well of me, but I cost double equity of others, and as much as others in salary.
- He is quite willing to fire folks when he does not see them as worth the cost, and have HUUUUGE equity relative to others.
- Indeed Brian (head of SW) once quipped:  "at one point or another Jason has said he is going to fire nearly everyone in the co"


CORE PROBLEM -- I don't have a solid role.
	- My job letter says 'head of AI' but we have a computer vision team lead, and other things are not critical right now
	- He gives me a la carte tasks (like analyze GPT-4 as a risk, or gather data for a pitch deck), but I don't have a real role.
	- I have been providing good value to the software lead, and I think he likes me and is a real ally
	- The rank and file love me I think, and already come to me as a leader often.
	- The Head of SW is a good ally, and we seem to complement well.
	- The AI lead has his elbows out near his turf, but was receptive when I chatted and offered to help.


BAD MOVE
- I have been having weekly calls when Jason has a moment he will call
- But I have not been part of the Sam-Jason weekly lunch (will try get in on that)
- I have not had a fixed scheduled weekly call with him, and have been pretty heads down with the team....
	- Jason is seeing lots of evidence around the edges of outputs from these activities, but its not being formally reported.


BAD SIGNS

- Random taskings - at some level I think he is trying to figure out how to get value from me.
	- Figure out if GPT-4 is going to 
	- This PIVO system is not getting delivered, figure out where we are and if we are really going to have it functioning.
	- Is Joaquin working well as a QA? Brian is slow to fire, find out what we should do.

- Recently he just increased the hours of his spiritual co-founder Sam so he could run product, and manage Jack who is a high energy 22y/o.
	- Defacto managing the tie together of SW and product and AI, which could have be a pretty good role for me.
	- Sam is older, and no fire in belly, so I likely would do better in tying stuff together than he will.
	- Jason didn't even consult me about this shift -- not very co-founder like.

- Got smacked on the writ to not "chase every shiny thing" but focus on AI which is what we brought you in for
	- I noticed that we HAD an AI team lead, but that the rest of the org was in the crapper, so that is where I went.
		- told him my plan was to do that for some months but then transition towards more AI focus
	- He said:  oh, well our AI guy is fully vested in 9-months and might leave.
	- I said: so what do you want me to do?  fix our SW stuff, or focus on AI?
	- He said: ok, so for the next month or two just keep working on the SW side.

- Bridge Round Financing
	- We are now doing a bridge round, and Jason has asked me to check with my contacts to see if I can get an intros
	- I just found out that 


GOOD SIGN
- Saturday Jason called and said, I want us to do stats for 1000 games for Cerebro
- At the end of the call he said  "And I want to be out with customers and then come back to you, and have you just make these happen"



STATUS
- Overall the company has been a bit of a shit-show.  
- we really don't test well, have not planned well.
- Jason and Sam are both very much 'executive' managers, they are not in the weeds with issues
- Jason has a rosier view of our capacity and leadership than I think is accurate.




THREE POSSIBLE ROLES FOR DAN

**CoFounder: I go where the problem is;  CTO Ninja**
- jumping between broken places and helping to fix them.
	- Leverages my experience and breadth. Keeps me from getting tied into 'monitoring' roles.  Maybe max value for company?
		- BUT can lead to de-confliction issues.  Getting credit.  Owning a function over long term.

**CTO - head of software team**
- Ownership of our end-to-end delivery of 
- Clearer rules of engagement:  Organizationally A reports to B, B reports to A, A and B have unrelated roles, or A and B "compete" for responsibility.

**Head of AI -** 
- Lead AI team
- Get deep into the AI-algs to drive sustained differentiation with the team.




POSSIBLE NEXT STEP DISCUSSIONS I COULD HAVE

- MICHAEL - Just bring issue up with Mike, head of AI, to see if he plans to stay, and talk about how we BOTH can add value if he does.
- SAM - Talk with Sam about situation and get advice.
- JASON - Talk about one or all of these:
	- Ask Jason again what he wants from me.
	- Raise issue about not consulting before the org-change and about fund raising.
	- Acknowledge that (not with intent) I have come in the door, but w/o a mandate that I can execute.
- BRIAN - He is an ally, get his take and support.  But not sure about his support to become his boss.



BIG PICTURE

=> HEAD OF AI - I can lead the AI team, and I think do so in a way that is more precise and higher tempo than Michael.  And I can be a co-founder, this is a thing that I doubt Mike will never be.


=> HEAD OF SW - I can be the co-founder that owns the delivery of all of our technology - and do this, not as an executive manager of others, but as one that understands all the way to the bottom what we are doing, and where stuff is going off the rails.


Our poor performance over the last two years is primarily due to this gap.
Its not something that you couldn't do, but it is something that you didn't and don't have the bandwidth to do given other responsibilities.

Presently the only other candidate for this Brian.

He is an excellent team lead and tracks details well.  BUT he does not get in there and assess if choices being made on the back end are going to extend to other sports (or even across basketball).  Hint: They are not.

He doesn't zoom out and consider how the whole product connects with the ecosystem and customers.

He is pretty gapped in creating and assessing processes.

He is happy enough simply accepting the devs we get from one source.

He seems like a company man, focused on justifying support for resources to get his job done, but does not think like a do-or-die co-founder and own the mission of the whole company winning.  Just not operating at that level or with that hunger.

Neither of your leaders have the hunger of a co-founder.




~ Copied to 

For SportsVisio to win it seems there are three big objectives that we need to meet:
(1) Raise the funds required to execute
(2) Deliver fully-automated AI-based sport stats
(3) Deliver a stream of polished SW products from high-functioning SW team


- If it is to deliver full AI stats, then I need to build a road map from where where are today to that goal, and it needs to be structured well so it leverages Mike if he stays and does not gap if he leaves.  BUT
	- I am not happy w/ our hiring process:
		- Vishal is the only non-Talent-cross person we have not fired.
		- TC loves interviewing w/ us because no test, just quick interview
		- On both sides we bring folks in for LONG time before firing
	- Not happy that we are running all our guys fully parallel because we are not sure who is able to deliver value.  (its a good tactical hack, but shows where we are at)
	- Roadmap might have Mike & I splitting technical responsibility:
	  e. g. maybe I would have him run a 'tracking' task force delivering player halos & while I coordinate others to deliver the balance of the
	  AI capabilities.
	  But it would be a UNIFIED vision & elbows would not be out as it is clear who owns responsibility for the outcome.


- You might say, No I prefer Dan owns the delivery high functioning products and SW team, and Mike owns delivery of autonomous AI as part of that team. Thus Dan needs to be ready if Mike leaves his role.
  But Dan's scope is delivery of the product as a whole:
	- But again not I am not in an ideal position to shape towards success of that larger role either:
	  Yesterday Scott half-delivered a few solutions for Mark that were not sufficient, but he did not test them well enough to ensure they were sufficient, so in the 11th hour we are scrambling to cobble alternatives.
	- If he reported into my org, I would be having a discussion with HIM about ownership today, but he's not my guy, and I don't own that delivery.


But presently I don't own the delivery of any of those things.
--> I have been nipping at the edges of things and providing tactical value anywhere I see great need.  We have some dumpster fires to that adds value, but 
- This does not put me on path to delivering fully autonomous AI stats, nor high-functioning products and high-functioning org.
- Worse I am not in the ideal position to be shaping things right now towards those deliverables.
- And this ambiguity harms efficient collaboration as elbows can be a good way to jockey for responsibility.

### t2023-01-19 Co-founder @ SV?

My text response turned into an incoherent ramble!  Let me frame the issue:

My natural (and currently stated) mandate is to:  (1) Lead R&D,  (2) be the 'chief architect', (3) drive hiring, and (4) drive investor relations
- These are ideal roles, but they are not very central prior to the A-around.

Prior to A-round I plan to look for and help fix critical gaps:
- in  our current team composition across all departments, focusing mostly on tech.
- in our software and data management practices.
- in our methodology for finding product market fit.
- in our product features as needed to maximize new customer acquisition.
- in other things I uncover in digging into our operations.



My sense is that I have greatest value in understanding that something is not going well, and having creative ideas about how to fix it, and perhaps rolling up my sleeves and helping with the creation of that fix.  I think I add relatively less value in the routine day to day monitoring of execution.

- So one way I might operate is to: (1) identify an area of concern, (2) foment consensus with Jason and others about an approach, (3) roll up sleeves with team to address issue.  (4) Then move on to the next one.  I did this with the recent revamp of the entire product's formulation.  Future fixes will likely be smaller in scope, but still of that nature.
- It not clear I need a report to structure to achieve this.  I need a CEO and senior leadership who I can convince of problem and solution.  And really the only report-to structure that would suffice in providing the natural authority required to drive these changes would be to have the entire SW org report to me.

So I can just aim to own the whole SW team, but that takes me down the path of day to day execution tracking somewhat.
As a founder it is kind of natural to just dive into places of greatest pain but then not stick around after that.
I feel as long Jason agreed with me about what the problem areas were, and agreed they were better after I intervened, he would be quite happy with my value.


So this is what aimed me towards the co-founder style role.  but maybe I should be aiming more narrowly, then the dig in and try to fully execute that narrower thing?
I can also try to do the same thing as a CTO.  Later I may have trouble justifying my scope, but perhaps I am over thinking things....


But when you suggest I should aim to have my report-to structure match my objectives, I am at a loss for what that would mean, except to have the whole SW org report to me.  





It feels a bit safer and better explained if I have such a 
-

- If this is the role I aim for, then having the co-founder title matches what I am doing

### t2022-07-26  Notes for letter of reference

IDEAS:

Dan is a high energy and capable leader across many dimensions:

- I watched Dan rapidly build out a team of the highest quality team of 40+ PhD specialists using sophisticated combination of scaled outreach and assessment along with innovative university partnerships.     

- Dan is fast on his feet and creative, both in a high stakes client meetings, or in working with the team in overcoming unexpected execution problems threatening delivery schedules.    (diluted)

- He is an unusual combination of very technical at the lowest levels, and very articulate, organized, and compelling at the highest level.  

- He quickly comes up to speed in disparate technical sub-areas in order to help the team creatively problem solve with the team, or to pitch a new approaches for a new client.  Often on the heels of our first meeting with a new client, it would be Dan proposing how our or other technologies might productively apply to their problems.  

- Dan is a creative technical problem solver, he gets up to speed in very deeply into new areas and works with the team to propose new solutions to new clients, or to help attack details within ongoing projects.  

- As a leader dan is very process oriented allowing him to effectively structure organizations and execution for greatest effect.  In one of our more technically complex efforts he built out a two-level reporting structure that streamlined integrations in a way that afford highest development speeds.

- Finally Dan has the highest levels of integrity.  This has been a crucial ingredient in maintaining the trust and alignment we needed as co-founders over the twists and turns that occur in founding a company founding.  And that integrity along with a kind of infectious energy allows him to hire, retain, and lead world class technical talent.

### t2022-06-28  Request for Letter of reference

Nick, 
I am getting my public persona together for interviewing.  You have been the constant factor over the last 8+ years, so I think it would be great to get a letter of reference from you.  Perhaps a longer one that can be sent, but for the moment I am focused on having one on my linked-in.  This one should be a couple of paragraphs, but not so long that folks wont read it.  

Let me know if you have the bandwidth to write one.

Thanks!
--dan


In many ways you are better at this, than I am, so feel free to take the note in any direction you see fit.
If it saves you time, here are some ideas that came to me...


Perhaps it can be structured around the fact that we have been co-founders and in every big decision I have been an able "right hand man".
Just an overall sense that we were in the trenches for many years together, and look forward to the next chance we get to jump into the trenches with him.
Also, consistent with the CTO title and the idea of an AI practice, I was your 'go to person' for technical questions and particularly for AI/ML related ones.

A-la-carte ideas:
- Strong in constructing processes.
- Strong ability to hire world class talent within competitive markets.
- Having high EQ enabling me to support and retain rarified talent.  (ok, so I think that was majority YOUR effort, still I think I do have pretty strong EQ and was a positive influence when I was more active)
- Fast on feet.  Strong at presenting in high consequence meetings.  
- Able create and coalesce others around a strong technical vision.  (here I am thinking mostly about Aeolus, as I had less chance for that on other AF projects)
- Innovative in finding pragmatic solutions to problems.
- Good executive judgement about people and about business decisions.




### m2021-07-28 - Meeting with Nick and Michael

-- Need for money fucks things up
	-- I SHOULD be accountable to my 'users'
	-- But need to turn $300K plus profit quickly, limit impact & directions
	-- I had it, and I let it go.
	-- On paper I wrote $150K-$400K before marriage.
	-- Mid-stream on two decade idea.  Sad to drop it.
-- Depressed.  anxious.  shell shocked.  Not in a good decision-making frame

Ready to sacrifice all
- Was ready to sacrifice everything be in a spot where my time is spent thinking hard thoughts, in impactful areas, alternating with deep dives into the market to make one connect.
  	(not clear I have skills.  I have 3 year attention, but maybe not 10yr)
  
  -- Don't feel I spent last 10 years in an effective way.
  	-- Always favored less risky, less motivating paths first, never went beyond
  	-- Nearly all attempt were not well formed, or nor well mentored
  	-- Whole time were string half attempts, made w/ half conviction,
  	-- My aim was lowest risk path to lifestyle, so never reached.
  	-- Good evidence that I do operate very differently given different context 
  
  -- Nick says
  	-- Lack conviction to drive in a single direction.  True.
  But that is because multiple directions are all acceptable
  	-- Perhaps too late to take on the risk of a startup 
  	-- All have significant risks
  
  -- When happy:
  	Technical Ideation.  & Leading a team technically.  Enjoy multiplication.   
  -- Aspects:
  	Enjoy super deep, on multiple.  Thinking time exists. flexibilty which first

### m2021-07-27 - Nick's request info

1. Make a decision tree of the choices you are evaluating & probably outcomes
2. Score the outcomes based on 3-5 metrics you care about
3. Assign probability to the outcomes
4. Talk to like 5 people in the know & ask them for feedback. They will probably give you feedback that updates the tree, especially around probability, but maybe also sanity checks about what it’s like
