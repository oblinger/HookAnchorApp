## Loans

[His loan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xHVpVsxHcarJHsMQ1IODOqgkum66D-BU8Mhp2ga7swc/edit#gid=0)  

2022-04-14 - ($1,797) - Dan sent 102,732.09 PHP to james.   $1,797 USD
2022-05-06 - $182.51 - James paid
2022-06-03 - $181.68 - James paid

(see log too)

  
So let's document our plan going forward:


  

  

  

I was originally going to give you an additional $800.  But you wanted that to be $1000.  So let’s do that.

Here is my thinking for a concrete plan… see if you like it as an approach….  You can suggest edits if you want something changed:

1. Dan will Paypal James an additional $1000 now so you have some money in the bank for safety and spending.
2. During the coming months I would suggest you try hard to keep at least $400 in your bank account as a reserve, even if you have to cut your own dicretionary spending, and cut your brothers spending too, in order to keep that $500.  (I think you mental state is damaged by being too close to zero, so you should just stop both your spending and your brothers in order to save from that.
3. During the coming months, I think you cannot keep paying the full $180 that you have been paying in the past until your brother’s business builds up.  Still I think it is mentally better if you are paying some amount during this time towards your loans.  I was thinking about $100 USD/mo during this time.  What do you think?  Is that a good amount to set?  Please suggest a different one if that cannot work.
4. When your 13th month bonus comes in, the first spending that you will do with it, is to pay off the original loan that we had, so that way you will only owe me $1000 USD after your bonus.  There will probably be a bit of extra bonus left, you just put that into your bank account, and that will help you with later payments too.
5. In January we will decide what payment rate should be for the remaining $1000 USD, but however we do it we should shoot to pay off the loan in the first 1/2 of the year, if we can, and no matter what pay it off by end of 2023.
6. I added my original loan amount to the spreadsheet we are sharing, and I will also add the $1000 USD I am sending you now… that way we have a running total, and can see when this amount had dropped below the $1000 number after Jan-1.
