### m2022-10-30  MY VALUE - Notes for Theo<>Jason Reference call

- Ability to create and execute processes for production quality outputs.
	- Lead Payments Platform were all transactions had to complete error free & interface needed to look perfect.
	- I was leading a team of 60+ so I am not doing it all directly myself.  Still it is important to emphasize as many cases as you can where I am in the weeds on quality.  And of course I learned by being part of it too.
	- Because of our velocity & timeline it was chaos, but we needed great many fixes to support quality for CES
	  Then in the of our time @ Aeolus we were beginning to ship robots to Japan where they were in spaces with elder patients


	- CENTRAL IN CREATING MUCH OF OUR PROCESSES & DOCS - then we collectively evolved these over time
	- SAFETY REQUIREMENTS - 
	- CELL PHONE DEMOS - We instituted Cell Phone Demos, 
	- RE-RE-STRUCTURING TEAMS TO MINIMIZE DEPENDENCIES 
	- REQ UPSTREAM INTEGRATION TESTS - Required upstream integration & test as part of ticket completion
	  (authored the spec levels of testing for each ticket.  (e.g. smoke test, etc.))
	- SCRUM OF SCRUMS - Weekly scrum of scrums
	- 24/7 TEST&DEV CENTER - Remote dev center.  initial setup of the resource tracking docs.
	- HIRING TESTS - Authored our hiring tests, and got into the coding weeds with each finalist candidate before hiring.
	- HANDLING ESCALATIONS - Handling escalations of problems.
	- SEPTEMBER CODE REWRITE
	- Monitoring quality on sprints
	- MIT QUALITY - Systematic testing in operational conditions:
		- TURN TABLE - Developed turn table systematic data collect; Live robot data collect;
		- CONTINUOUS TEST FLOOR DATA COLLECTING
