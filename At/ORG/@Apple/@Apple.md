- Serial:  H0YMG2NV01TV
- https://getsupport.apple.com/caselookup
- Case #102339787985

Back in August I reported this issue (Case #102339787985). It is still not resolved!
Once a day  the Airpod Max device locks up.  
Noise cancelling is on, but no buttons work (e. g. to toggle noise cancelling)
A hard reset will fix it, but the problem will recur over and over.

### 2021-00-00 - apple support chat 
You're now chatting with Andy.

AndyThanks for contacting Apple Support. My name is Andy. Please give me a moment to look over your information.

AndyHello Dan! How are you today?

Me:hey Andy... heads up.  your website is busted.  specifically if you ask for phone support it just locks up with an infinite spinning cursor   (and I am doing fine!)

Me:on to my laptop

Me:just went in for HW repair of my bluetooth.  thanks!

Me:but I told them about crashes of the OS.  basically a kernel panic, and I must reboot.  

Me:that is still happening ... now with greater frequency.  more than once a day sometimes.

AndyI’m sorry to hear that! When was the last time you did a Time Machine backup of your Mac?

Me:today.

AndyAwesome! Are you chatting in from the Mac in question?

Me:yes

AndyGot it. What I’d recommend doing is reinstalling macOS on your Mac using your Time Machine backup. These steps do require your Mac to be shut down. What’s a good email address to send you the steps?

Me:just did this.

Me:they gave me a clean machine.

Me:I needed to do a time machine restore onto it.

AndyHow did you go about it?

Me:I went onto the recovery partition and told it to do a time machine restore on top of the new OS.  

AndyGot it. Just making sure!

Me:np.

AndyDid you go straight to restoring your TM backup, or did you use it without at all?

Me:my mac is kind of a brick w/o all my software, so I did the backup straight aways.

Me:can we look at the driver that was active when all hell broke loose?

AndyGot it. I’m just curious because it might be a software issue causing it. In which case, we’d have to do a manual backup

Me:check the logs

AndyWe don’t actually check logs over chat

Me:k.  do you know how to direct me?  I think it is pretty quick to look at that crash event right?

Me:but I am a linux guy

AndySorry, as I mentioned, it’s not something we do at this level, so I wouldn’t be able to direct you to the logs

AndyBut what I can do is send you steps on how to run diagnostics on your Mc

AndyMac*

AndyWhat’s a good email address to send those steps to?

Me:yeah, I am sure they did that at the factory.

Me:ok, so

Me:how do we move forward.  I think this is probably hardware.

Me:it almost always happens when the mac is trying to restore from screen saver.

Me:seems like either a driver on restore, or something about sleep state itself.

AndyI can always get you back into the Apple Store, but I’m not entirely convinced it’s hardware. Have you gone into a test user to see if the issue remains?

Me:well the failure occurs after extended use then sometimes on sleep.  my challenge is how to I use it enough during test user... when none of my stuff is there?

AndyYour apps should still be available on the other user. Or you can always set the sleep preferences to really short and see if it will trigger it again

Me:when I do a carbon-copy-cloner of my system's hard drive onto a second Mac, that mac never crashes.

Me:this is a bit-for-bit copy of my hard drive, so if this was a SW issue it seems it would likely crash my other mac.  but it does not

AndyThe software is identical, but is it an identical Mac?

AndyIf not, then it still may be a software issue. That being said, I’m more than happy to get you into an Apple Store if you wish

Me:no.  it is a MBP 13"  so some firmware will be different.

Me:well want I want to do, is to do all actions needed to determine that they need to replace the mother board.  I don't want to go in, and have them send me back to do other testing.

Me:lets do the testing now needed.

AndyI understand. The trick with Logic board issues is that they can’t be directly diagnosed sometimes. It usually is diagnosed by other things going wrong (like what you’re describing) That being said, I’d be happy to get those run. What’s a good email address to send you the steps

Me:oblinger@gmail.com

AndySent! Would you mind checking your email? I’d like to be sure you’ve received it and that the steps make sense to you.

Me:happy to run those tests.  if they are negative (they probably will be since they tested at factory) then are we in a position to do a HW swap?

AndyYep!

Me:sweet.

Me:nothing at the inbox yet

AndyIt won’t be from me directly. It’ll say something like “Thank you for contacting Apple Support"

Me:yes got it.

Me:so I will run these.  and if it finds a HW error, then we replace the HW.  and if it does not find a HW error (most likely case since it was tested at the factory), they we are ready to replace the HW.

Me:correct?

AndyYep!

Me:ok so either way...  still I am happy to run the test.

Me:are you noting all of this in my record?  what should I do after I run the test?

AndyI am leaving detailed notes, yes



correct?

AndyYep!

Me:ok so either way...  still I am happy to run the test.

Me:are you noting all of this in my record?  what should I do after I run the test?

AndyI am leaving detailed notes, yes

AndyEither way, once you’re done, let’s go ahead and get you back into the Apple Store. Let them know the repair center did a full wipe of your hard drive, and that it still happens

Me:ok.  so I am guessing that I can just do a drop off of the machine today.  no need for a genius bar appt right?

AndyI’d feel better if I got you a reservation, just in case

AndyThey might not require it since it’s a repeat, but I’d rather do so just in case

AndyWhat’s your zip code?

Me:94158

Me:my plan is to head out soon after the test and take my chances.. but good to have a reservation on the books too

AndyIt’s kinda like going into the California DMV without an appointment sometimes

AndyDo you have a preferred store?

Me:right  :-)   but if you are willing to just walk away w/o the laptop, usually the guy can take it.

Me:union square

AndyNext available reservation is for next Friday @ 12:15 PM. Shall I schedule that for you?

Me:sure.  but I will be there today  :-)

AndyI know :)

AndyGreat! I’ve gone ahead and scheduled that reservation for you. When you arrive at the Apple Store, be sure to check in for your reservation. You can do this either by using the free Apple Store app on your iPhone, available through the App Store, or by speaking with any available associate, letting them know you’re there for your Genius Bar reservation.

Me:as long as my notes say it is time to repair the machine, I feel comefortable they will take it.

AndyYep! They will say that I sent you

Me:it is only if they don't know what to do that I  will have trouble.

Me:You guys are awesome.

Me:I would never by a different brand... and it is 100% you guys!

Andy aww, thanks! I’m glad we’ve been able to come through for you :)

Me:cheers!
