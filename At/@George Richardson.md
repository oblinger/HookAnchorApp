### t2022-10-31  Email about terminating the differed comp plan

George, 
We had a single session two years ago about getting a prenup, but it was too close to getting married to do it. 
This might still happen, but the context is more complex, and the need is lower, so it might not.

In any case, I have a narrow question of the moment, that I would like to get advice on.  I am happy to pay your hourly if it is worth doing that, but it may also be an easy answer:

— I earned good money right up to getting married but that gravy train ended right at the marriage (unrelated events).
— During that time, and in the first year of marriage I put money into a deferred compensation plan.
— All of that money going into the deferred comp account came from my personal (non-commingled) Vanguard account.  
— There might have been two months of overlap when I received a pay check that gave me the 1099s needed to support the deferred comp payments.
— But I was careful to have 100% of any money made during the marriage to never to INTO my vanguard account
— Now I will terminating the deferred comp account and transferring it back into my IRA also in Vanguard.

So during the marriage no money went into Vanguard, just back and forth between these accounts which represent the deferred comp.
— Some of this did generate taxes that we paid jointly.  (This is not too much money)
— During the marriage I have been flowing money out of vanguard into our joint accounts. (Far more than any taxes paid)

When I do this termination of my deferred comp plan it will generate a 1099 DURING the marriage, but this is all money that flowed into those account from my personal accounts.
She will be signing notarized forms about these transfers too.


So am I in the clear here?
And is there any danger when I do this transfer to have it all flow back into my IRA account?
It would be a pain, but I could also have a second IRA with just those monies if that some how is a protection.

Happy to do a call about this, or get a response via email and happy to pay for the consulting too as needed either way.

I will be acting on this, this year if I can, so this is down to the wire (but of course I can pay for another years management if I must)

Happy holidays!

Hi, Dan. Thanks for your time today. Please be sure to complete and return the Client Information form. Thanks.

Since we talked for awhile, I thought it would be helpful to summarize the major points of our conversation.

-   All property, for CA purposes, is either separate property or community property. Put most simply (and of course, there are wrinkles,) CA law presumes that any property acquired during marriage is community property. The presumption that property acquired during marriage does not apply to property acquired by way of inheritance or gift. Separate property is everything else. As you described your property situation, none of the wrinkles apply to you and Qinglin.
-   Earnings during marriage are typically community property. The critical timing relates to when the income was earned, not when the income was received. You described some significant deposits around the date of your marriage that were earned before marriage, but received after marriage. Those deposits are separate property.
-   The character of property as separate or community does not change, even if the form of property changes. That is, withdrawals from your separate property Vanguard account are still separate property unless you do something to change the character. You told me that you have been very careful to maintain the separate property character of your Vanguard account. We also discussed that separate property used for necessities of life will essentially be treated as community property.
-   Separate property used to acquire a community property asset is subject to reimbursement (dollar for dollar, without recognition of appreciation or interest) upon divorce. The most common example of this would be buying a house, using separate property funds for the down payment, and taking title as community property. The house is community property, but, upon divorce, the separate property down payment would, if requested, be returned to the person(s) who contributed the separate property down payment.
-   The right of reimbursement just described can be waived, but only in writing.
-   Separate property can be converted (“transmuted”) into community property and vice versa, but only in writing.

With that background, moving your separate property investments around to reorganize them in tax deferred investments will not change their character as separate property unless you mix the separate property with the community property. You have been very careful not to let that happen, so I’m not going down that rabbit hole! You are working with a tax professional to address the various tax questions that may come up as part of your reorganization.

  

We also discussed that you and Qinglin have not prepared an estate plan. With the size of your assets and amount of earned income, you definitely do not want to allow your estate to go into probate. I am not an estate planning or probate professional, and I very strongly advise you to get an estate plan in place to protect both your estate and your heirs. In that regard, here are the names of some estate planning lawyers, in alphabetical order. Please let them know that I referred you.
