Moses, 
This was such a good meeting!  Thanks.  It is quite surprising how closely your knowledge and experience matches this idea.  It is a very auspicious connection.  It is far too early to understand how things might be connected together, still I can see how this kind of a system could work well with an international center in Ghana, it is an idea to keep in mind.


You asked me for a list of next step items just to keep these efforts organized.  We actually mentioned a pretty big list of items like the framework for analyzing potential businesses etc.  Rather that create such a large list right now, I will keep this focused on immediate actions.  Here are two items:
- Business info for green house farming and for agricultural product transportation 
- Introductions at US-aid and MOFA


BUSINESS CASES
Even before you make any introductions at US-aid or MOFA, I think it will be quite valuable to try to paint a very basic picture of how this system might work in the case of an actual business.  I thought about the different cases we discussed, and it occurs to me two business types stand out:

- GREEN HOUSE FARMING - As you mentioned such businesses are easier to fund since they are more reliable, and I expect that there is notable skill and cash needed to setup a green house and then maximize every square meter of its output for maximum profit.  I bet this is an area where cash and training can have large value.  I also bet this is a business where it would be reasonable to create a 20 or 100 person shared corp - I think the size of the business might be good.  
  
  At this stage it would be super useful to have ANY kinds of numbers about what the setup costs would be, and what kind of revenue was plausible.  I am not trying to build the actual business case here; rather I would just love to have some 'kind-of' real numbers in a simple table so that when I speak about this idea I have at least one business where I have very basic numbers that show the idea at least as potential.

- AGRI-BUSINESS TRANSPORTATION - This idea which we began with has the virtue of being more easily analyzed and paid back since it is a pretty simple business.  Thus having basic numbers for a specific case (like Coconut transportation near a particular city) would lend some credibility to the presentation.
  
  I know it will take alot of work to get real numbers for either of these, I am hoping there is some easy starting point that I might integrate into my thinking even before I discuss these ideas with others.


INTRODUCTIONS
My thought is that as soon as I have any initial info you might have easy access to, I could then connect with your contacts, perhaps to have that three way call if they have the interest.



I look forward to future discussions.  Thanks much for such a good call.

Regards,
--Dan
