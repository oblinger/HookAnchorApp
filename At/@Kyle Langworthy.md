Kyle, I really appreciate the time you spent with me today in this 11th hour it was a very effective way for me to get a good bird's eye view of what the market would have been like, had I actually had the opportunity to look.  I really like your "director-level narrative" way of thinking about approaching the FAANG market.  I think my value is indeed maximized in cases where advanced research meets productization in some way, and I think it will require a strong match for me to land such a director position.  As discussed I am leaving you with a couple of narrative starting point.  


Director-level narratives:

- ROBOTICS - At Martian & Aeolus robotics I founded and grew advanced robotic teams with specializations in the manipulation of arbitrary rigid objects and low cost multi-object recognition and tracking.

- COMPUTER VISION - At Martian, Aeolus, and Analytics Fire I oversaw novel deep learning computer vision research and commercialization.

- GOV RELATED R&D - As a DARPA Program Manager I oversaw the creation and execution of 3 programs worth more than $200M.  I have extensive contacts an insider's understanding of gov funding and procurement processes.


If Riviera Partners is retained for a relevant search in the next year or two, I will be quite excited to hear about it.


**STARTUP COMPENSATION** #compensation ^comp
- Typical Startup Equity for a CTO:   1.2-1.7% at the A-round.      2-2.5% Equity grant for a VC backed seed.
- Seed stage $200K salary is inline.
- At Series A - salary at $300K is also reasonable.
