### 2024-08-11  Veo Partnership Discussion




  
Concretely I plan to talk in generalities about what we can and cannot do, and in generalities about the quality levels we can achieve, but not be exact on anything.  So, for example, if they asked if we can do player ID.  I would say "yes, but gaining sufficient accuracy in all contexts remains a work in progress.”  I do want them to see us as desirable and capable, thus I will talk up the difficulty of doing basketball, and toss out of half dozen or so specialty modules that we have build as part of our end-to-end solution.  I think naming these (like shot-origin analysis via three separate approaches) makes us look super cool, and makes the build-vs-buy equation tip towards BUY.  
  
If they press us about having things in production, my thought is to be optimistic and talk about AI-minutes and annotator halo speedups as being "capabilities that we have working."  If they really press on this, I would be honest about their current status.
