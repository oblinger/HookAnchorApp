Thanks Chris and hello Jack,

  

Thursday afternoon sounds great.  How about 1pm EST?  I am on PST.  

  

I've been doing basketball analytics for the past 7 years with my twin 16 year old daughters.   As a hockey and baseball guy I ran "moneyball" stats on 11-year-olds so I could learn the game by watching and recording what happened on the game video.  In 2021 I was an analytics coach on Vancouver Island with a PACWEST women's college team, the Camosun Chargers out of Victoria, BC.    

  

We use the video highlights from Qwikcut stats and VEO a lot for the twins social media recruiting profile accounts.

Currently, I'm a dedicated, daily user of Qwikcut.   Getting a Qwikcut analytics breakdown on my daughter's teams allows me to do higher-level analytics while the basics are covered.   Below is a link to my "Scores Created" summary that shows how our team is scoring and how our team is being scored against.     I can quickly watch only the scoring in a 32-minute AAU game and produce results like this in about 15 minutes.

Our Claremont High School Team plays at the AAAA level (size of school) and ranks in the top 10 in our Province of 5 million people.  

  

My twins played up last year at the end of the season and I have 6 games I didn't have marked up yet from their playoff run at last year's Provincial tournament.    Our team hasn't changed much so there would be value in seeing some details on this.    I only have paper and pencil stats on these games (attached) 

  

I had two things I thought might be of interest if we could play with these games before our season starts in December.

  

1) We are a very post-centric team playing off our 6 foot tall big Iva #23.    I would love to see the impact on scoring when she gets the ball in the paint and either takes it for herself or kicks it out to the perimeter after drawing coverage to herself. 

  

2) Our Coach likes to hold onto our possessions and fully use the 24-second shot clock.   I would like to delineate our shots between those taken in the first 12 seconds of possession and those taken in the final 12 seconds to see if taking this extra time gets us a higher percentage shot probability or points per possession. 

  

Looking forward to a chat.  Please send a link for a video call. 

  

Best,
