Rafah, 
Sorry for the delay in responding.  I wanted to do a bit more work on my Alien Biology idea before speaking with your colleague.  I hear you loud and clear, that really there is no direct avenue towards working with MSR (too bad), below my 'ask' is really on getting another expert's opinion about pushing the envelope on Agentic AI, and most specifically about how to best frame and test that gaps that remain based on the AI that we have today.  I provided a very specific 'ask' for discussion.  Let me know if you think diving that deep into the proposal in the ask is the best way to go, or perhaps I should let you make a higher level ask for a discussion?

Either way, my thought is to not send a link to the white paper itself in the ask, but provide it as an optional read ahead if he is so inclined right before the meeting.  Let me know your thoughts!

Cheers, 
Dan




Dimitris, 
Rafah told me a bit about your research interests, and they overlap with a testing paradigm I have recently been investigating.  I believe the challenge in honestly testing extended LLM-based inference is the unavoidable and essentially unknowable overlap with the data that those systems have been trained on.

I have an unusual end-run around this problem that involves wholesale construction of a synthetic "alien" biology built from alien molecules that behave according to an alien physics, yet still string together within alien organisms to form functional systems that can be discovered, diagnosed, and ultimately cured of synthetic alien diseases.  My focus is not on biology per se, but rather the controllable, untainted testing of extended agentic inference.  I would like your thoughts on how we might test (and develop) such agentic systems.

Let me know if you have time and interest in chatting about this.

Best, 
Dan

### t2022-11-01  Intro Email for Robotics Mgr

Rafah, awesome to catch up!  I am glad to hear your future plans include moving to more relaxing locations (both NH and FL fit that bill!)  
Looking forward to hearing a more in depth summary from your side on our next call.  
Here is a few sentences you can use to introduce me to your college who is setting up a new robotics group.

Dan is an ex-colleague of mine from IBM research.  He is in the midst of selling his third exited startup and is deciding what he's going to do next.  Here are a few words from him:  
  
The first half of my career was devoted to Machine Learning as an individual researcher (PhD from UIUC, IBM Researcher, and teaching at Columbia) then scaling that ML thousands of researchers as a Program Manager at DARPA.  The half has been in silicon valley focused on Robotics, Machine Learning, and HW+SW solutions.  I have co-founded a couple of successfully-exited Robotic / IoT companies, and twice hired & managed 50+ person orgs, including 40+ PhDs in Robotics.  
  
My sweet-spot and personal-love is managing teams that are bridging recent academic research into novel commercial plays.  I love the complex interplay between recently understood technologies and novel, not-fully-understood business use cases and products.  If there are roles within Microsoft that fit this kind of a sweet spot, I would love to hear about them!

Bozo,
How is it that we were best of friend in NYC, and then I head off to startup land and let that all fall away?!  I am selling my Cleantech/AI business and would love to get your advice on my next steps, but I ALSO would love to catch up on life too.  I (finally) have a young son to tell you about and I am sure you do too.

If you have time for two different calls, maybe we can have a catch up call first?  (If too busy, for all of that, I totally understand!)

Anyway it is super to get to write.  looking forward to connecting again.
 
cheers,
danny
