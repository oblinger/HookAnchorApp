## QUOTES

SELF-REGULATION MECHANISMS
- It is important for infants and children to develop early their own ways of handling stress and difficulty. 
- Such self-regulating mechanisms must be acquired and practiced throughout early childhood,

# Quotes

- The rock would smash you like Play-Doh. You don’t want to do that. Then you would be dead forever.

# FIRSTS

### 2024-02-17  Put on his underwear

I didn't touch the underware and he managed to figure out where the large opening was, and get both feet into the correct sides!
He almost can put his pants on, but both feet often end up down the same leg. :-)

The next day Mom said he also put his shirt and pants on without any help.
He came into me and we put his sox on together.
Unusually was letting me teach him where to pull to get the sox on.

### 2023-08-10 First Bike Ride
Grandma Ni gave Eli a bike for his birthday, and he road it down the block and to the mosque several times with Dad holding on to the back.
He was afraid initially, but grew willing to keep getting back on even when he fell.  (He insisted to ride by himself which ended quickly each time). After a few times he was content to let dad hold onto the seat or handle bar.

### 2022-11-23  QL planting ideas

- Eli was calling out for mom, so Dan comes out to play with him, and we play for a bit.
- QL comes down to play for the next hour (at is usual at lunch time)
- All three play for a period, with Dan and Eli building magnets.
- Quietly when locking eyes with QL, Dan says "your turn, I need to get back to work"    (Not clear if Eli heard or attended to this, he was not looking, and did not react or look up, just continued running around)
- About 20 second the train derails and Eli tries to fix it, but then has difficulty
- Hey yells, "Arrrgh!"  and crashes the train and the building we are building.  (its just a modest outburst)
- QL says,  "oh Eli are you mad because Daddy is going back to work?"
	- she then explains why this is ok, because she is helping to process this.

Its possible, but quite unlikely that my statement had any connection to his frustration in failing to get the train back on the track.

Still we know for certain his frustration was immediately caused by not being able to get the train back on the track.
