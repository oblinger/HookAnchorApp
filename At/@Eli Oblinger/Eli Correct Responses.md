==> 4 year old does not have impulse control.
==> 4 year old does not understand appropriate behavior yet

QUOTE FOR US:
As your child gets older, they'll begin to see a connection between emotional outbursts and negative consequences.

Throwing a tantrum may result in a "time out" or a favorite toy being taken away. 
These consequences are helping your 4-year-old understand a tantrum isn't an acceptable way to show emotion.

From Dan:  
- Above they are talking about negative consequences, and we can use those some times.
- But DOUBLY important is that we do not provide POSITIVE reward for unwanted behavior.
- And in the words of Miss Amanda:   Your ATTENTION is the largest reward you can give a child, so don't give attention for unwanted behavior.

When he acts in appropriate to you, you need to pull away.  

Even if he is tired etc, it is STILL teaching him bad patterns to give attention when he is acting out.
I think you can ignore it just a bit and see if he will settle.  Still if he does not settle you need to pull away, let him melt down and then calm down.

As your article says:  he does not know what appropriate behavior is, we need to use consequences to show him.
And as Miss Amanda says, the a key consequence is withdraw of our attention.


(1) ignore & engage
(2) distract
(3) disengage
(4) consequence

don't reward with attention



## Emotional Vaccination


BEFORE AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT
1. Connection -- 
2. Validation -- 
3. Story To Understand --

END OF SCREEN TIME
- Connect - how will we feel
	- Model taking deep breath - 
- Validation - lets get some out of the way
	- said in a kidding way:  "I wanna watch one more"
	- said 
- Story to understand - 


SIT ON EMOTIONAL BENCH *WITH* CHILD
- connect and experience feeling w/o trying to pull them off the bench
## Don't ask why he does not want to go to school

- when they don't want to go to school.
- reason:  they will make stuff up based on the words they know.


## Don't ask what they want, when you only want one answer



## Make sure he feels "seen"
