## 2025-12-07  Eli's Name

Eli, 
Your name has a couple of meanings:
- Eli means "to rise up." and is a name for God.
- Also, a famous priest and teacher in the Bible was named Eli.
- Your middle name Haorui is made from two parts:
	- Hao is about having integrity and honesty
	- And Rui means wise, intelligent and perceptive. 

We wanted a short, unique name.  And we wanted it to connect to wisdom in some way.
When we first thought of Eli, we just fell in love with it.  Quickly, it was our number one choice!

Love, 
Mom and Dad
