I am full up to here.  (pointing at his chest)  so I can't eat any more.

Dad gives him one more bite. 

Now I am full up to here.  (pointing at his head). There is no more room.

one minute later....

Can I have an icecreme with one scoop?

But you are full, right?

But I have just this spot here for icecreme.

Oh well if you have a spot then we can put the eggs in that spot.

No, eggs can't go in that spot, only ice creme.

Eli says:  "What is this?"

Mom says: "Who did this?"

Eli says:  "I did, but you didn't wipe them off"
