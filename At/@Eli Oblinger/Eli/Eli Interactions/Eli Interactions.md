## ELI ATTRIBUTES

SENSITIVE - 


RESISTANT 
Eli is resistant to almost ANY activity no matter how fun



## POINTS OF AGREEMENT

### GIVE ELI CONTROL
Often we try to give Eli control over what happens and when it happens


### GIVE ELI WARNING


## POINTS OF CONTENTION

### AVOID BABYING HIM

We agree we should not to push Eli hard when he is resistant.
AND we agree we should interact with Eli to distract him and acclamatize him to the resistant activity.

BUT Dan draws the line at inappropriate screaming or baby behavior from Eli, in those cases he favors 
momentary disengagement from Eli followed by an invitation for appropriate interaction.



### AVOID NON-RESPONSIVE EXPLANATIONS / DISCUSSIONS



### AVOID ENDLESS PLACATION ATTEMPTS

- mabye you want this
- Maybe you want that

# LOG


## No  Drama Discipline - Chapter 1

-- No one-size-fits-all response!
- Need to experiment on what works

-- PAUSE.  Then ask:  
- Why did they do that?  
- What do we want to teach?  and  
- How can we best teach the approach?

-- What do we want to teach:
  - There are better alternatives to hitting

-- Problem Solve Later In a Teachable Moment




-- Get eye contact


Not a teachable moment

### 2023-06-08  From sensitivity class

- Going to school; 
- perfectionism.  
- separation.  
- Dance party


### 2023-06-03  Positive Discipline (from Miss Amanda)

- Less talk more action.
- Redirect - Don't explain in high emotion setting.
- Redirect as much as you can.
- Setting the ground rules long before the event.
- Retake - "lets rewind and try this again"
- Problem Solve - "I see you want to draw on the wall"
- Give two choices - ""
- Tell them why - when they really are gathering info
- Stories - "when I was a little child ..." - give the moral explicitly in the end
- Do it together - "Clean up together" - positive words at the end

BIG POINTS
- NO EXCUSES - Don't make excuses for them - have consequences
- CONFIDENCE - You are in control
- SET RULES - 
- BE CONSISTENT - never give in
- ATTENTION - give attention.  10-15min first home.  help them START activity.  Bonding time 30/day.  Listen carefully when they tell you something.
- POSITIVE ATTENTION - Little sugar is good.    NEGATIVE: short & sweet


- 
- Walk away to shut down bad behavior
- Don't explain in the moment.
- Explain in the evening.  In the morning it is a new day.
- Delay consequences.  can be long after 
- Consequence: no attention in the moment.
- Next day

- STRONG FEELINGS -- Have her feelings -> 
	- too much negative attention (need to separate)
	- acknowlings their feelings, but don't do down 
	- create strong and powerful children - by not


ISSUE:  We can create anxiety 
WHEN HE'S AFRAID
- Once your done giving them support, and constructive discussion. 
- Then you redirect, and just force the case
