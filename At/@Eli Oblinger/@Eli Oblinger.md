### - Good manners
listen during a story
turn the pages of a book
properly blow their nose
cover a cough
open or close a door
walk inside
greet a friend or visitor (or for older child, answer the phone)
say goodbye
wait for something
observe someone's work
pull out a chair
carry around furniture
walk with glass
handle sibling conflict
apologize
use basic manners "please," "thank you," "excuse me"
acknowledging something that has been said to them
return something to its proper place
touch a baby
brush their teeth
ask someone to play with them
decline an invitation to play
ask to play with someone else
This list could almost be endless!

Since this is a different way of parenting for most people it can take some time to get used to
it. Here are some tips to keep in mind:
1. These don't happen in a the moment. Choose a neutral time (not a time when your child is
exhibiting the undesired behavior) when everyone is calm. If you see something that needs to
change, use that time to observe and make a mental note to do a grace and courtesy lesson.
2.Keep your own expectations in check. Kids may need more than one lesson on the same
topic before they understand it. Avoid the temptation to just think your kids aren't listening or
are being naughty if they don't follow or understand these unsaid social expectations or rules.
3. Make it simple. The younger the child, the simpler the lesson should be. There's no one
specific script you need to follow, just adapt to your child's level.
4.Keep it fun and positive. Make a lesson about connection not correction. Avoid judgment,
don't bring up past behavior. Use humor, silliness and love to make your point.
5. Practice, practice, practice. These lessons will take time and patience. Maybe you give the
lesson a couple times. Maybe you practice a new skill together outside of the lesson for a
while. Maybe you're playing with dolls and they practice the skill! Just remember this isn't a
one-and-done thing.
6.Model. Practice what you preach! If you're asking your kids to hold a plate with two hands
and walk slowly to the table do it yourself. If you're asking your kids to talk in the house
then avoid yelling. They are absorbing your everyday behavior as much as anything else.
