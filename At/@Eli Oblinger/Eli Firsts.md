### 2023-11-20  First Crush - Babysitter

Maria came over so we could go for Eli's baptism class.

In the minutes after Maria (his favorite babysitter) arrived, he noticed the little hair brush we use on his hair.

(He has never once picked it up or used it before)

But now he grabs it and starts combing his hair down with relish.

I guess you just have to have the right motivation :-)

  grabbing a third one, put them together and said "three".  Then said "plus one". grabbing the last one "... is four".

- I asked about 2 + 3, and he got that one too.

- subtraction was a bit of an issue... but he was trying
