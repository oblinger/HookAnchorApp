## ELI ATTRIBUTES

SENSITIVE - 


RESISTANT 
Eli is resistant to almost ANY activity no matter how fun



## POINTS OF AGREEMENT

### GIVE ELI CONTROL
Often we try to give Eli control over what happens and when it happens


### GIVE ELI WARNING


## POINTS OF CONTENTION

### AVOID BABYING HIM

We agree we should not to push Eli hard when he is resistant.
AND we agree we should interact with Eli to distract him and acclamatize him to the resistant activity.

BUT Dan draws the line at inappropriate screaming or baby behavior from Eli, in those cases he favors 
momentary disengagement from Eli followed by an invitation for appropriate interaction.



### AVOID NON-RESPONSIVE EXPLANATIONS / DISCUSSIONS



### AVOID ENDLESS PLACATION ATTEMPTS

- mabye you want this
- Maybe you want that
