BIG Q:
- Is KMCO real?
- Want Google over Visio anyway?

ASSUMPTIONS:
- TECH-LEAD -- Many tech+leadership jobs fit dan in a general kind of way.
- RARE-DAN -- VERY few will fit Dan in a work-weekends-for-free kind of way.
				- Only long term one w/ maybe enough cash is Uniform
				- Go low-or-high.  Hobby time, or near pefect hit.
					Problem fits dan perfectly. job title allows working on it


ALTERNATIVES
- ?++ GOOG:	Can work less, good money/security, less ownership
- ??? KMCO:  Unicorn-level Time & Energy
- ??- VISIO:	Visio>Google on free time longterm?  (Loose KMCO chance)
		Visio>Google ownership.  Google>Visio on tech?  Know in 1yr.
		Google wins on $, but would in year if VISIO is acceptable.
					
- --- NO LIFESTYLE BIZ: AF is dead, any investors will want a unicorn 	
		trajectory, any biz (even lifestyle) will require 40++ hours per week for a long time.
- ??- CONSULT CO: Seems "mailing it in" at google would be easier and more 	
		rewarding and pay more than consult co.  But could work some.
- ?-- DAN CO: The only potentially viable DANCO seems to be a KMCO above
- ?-- BAT CO: Building any business that dan would not work on for free on his  
		weekends is a BAT CO.  Since lifestyle biz is dead, then Bat Co has a unicorn trajectory, thus it will leave very little room for hobby time.  So don't do it, if it is not a DanCO you are only gaining some ownership over a Google job, but loosing massive certainty and some freetime.

PATH #1 KMCO -- Shoot for KM, but prep for Google
- **_Love_** thinking Uniform/KM thoughts.
- KM space is saturated with others; Incumbents hold the high ground
- Must chase customer's problems, not uniform.  Must be CEO not CTO to start
- would be fun if it worked.
	==> Spend time trying to find KM (Uniform) related startup
	==> Spend time, preping for Google job and building Uniform HOBBY stuff

PATH #2 - Join VISIO
- Spend most time making Visio succeed
- Spend time on KM as hobby


OBSERVATIONS

VISIO 75% SUCKS -- 75% of VISIO cases worse than Google; 
	and 40% are quite bad after a multi-year delay, but 50% are close to Google
- BREAKDOWN -- Here is a slightly optomistic breakdown
		25% Fast fail (<18 mo)  25% Slow fail (<4 yr)  25% Ok growth  25% strong
		20% tech fails; 30% market kills us; 25% ok growth; 25% strong growth
- FACTORS -- Proven demand.  Available customer segments.  Super founder-ish.
	Tech is hard, but not too hard.  Pre-A-round (at A-round it is 10% success)

VISIO NO FERRIS LIFESTYLE -- Unlike my own startup, VISIO is unlikely to transition into longterm lifestyle.
- At 5M/yr w. certainty my own startup can give 500K/yr w. little work as CEO
- at 20M/yr VISIO would likely still not give that for ferris-level work

VISIO PART TIME IS OK -- Both now and in the future, it is likely I can work part time at Visio

VISIO AFTER A YEAR I WOULD KNOW
- Tech would be resolved; first market would have lots of evidence

VISIO REGRET MINIMIZATION
- 25% 1st yr fail -- I would have preferred google
- 25% 4yr fail -- I would have preferred google
- 20% strong co -- I happy I went w Visio
- 30% medium co -- 60/40 18%/12% I would prefer google to visio
	==> 68% prefer google.  32% prefer visio.  
	==> But I can jump to google, but not jump to visio
	==> Reason for Visio is Freetime.  after 2 years, I need it less 

VISIO: Stacking risks
- 25% Founder frustrations
- 25% Tech failure
- 30% Market failure (others take it from us, etc.)
	==> Result 40% success


AF-KMCO AFTER TWO YEARS
- 25% chance of gaining funding on UF-info; UF-ML; UF-mkt
- 20% chance of getting a google job related to this work

UF AFTER N-YEARS
- Best shot for UF is AF-KMCO.  
	More time on it; explicitly connecting to problems


KMCO -- What are the chances that a concerted effort would yield a viable target
- OTHER CO CTO -- CTO w. >150K salary and >1.5% of 100M.  hard: 50+hrs/wk
	Relevant to KM, but not really following a Dan idea


RISKS
- KMCO is riskier than VISIO - SuperFounder; Vision hardtech pivots; 5 dev-yrs
