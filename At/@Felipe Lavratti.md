### n2022-07-28  Job pointers at Amazon

Sorry for the spam!  

Forgot to mention: there is a reason why amazon has very few different job titles, each title is one different hiring pipeline.   

The famous FAANGs programming interview questions are only heavy on Software Engineer pipelines. Data scientists will have different interviews, I will ask my friends what they were asked and will share with you later.   Same for the Director title.   

Another important thing about interviewing at Amazon: the technical side is only 50%, the other 50% is what they call behavioural interviewing, where we ask a series of questions designed to sample data on Amazon's leadership principles, you need to have your stories ready and organized otherwise there is no time to provide rich data for this part, which I bet you know already.

Thanks !

Dan, just sharing some demographics on job availability at Amazon:  

Announced vacancies (US only) count:  
"Data Scientist" on the tile, L7: 321 vacancies
"Data Scientist" on the tile, L6: 1758 vacancies
"Software Engineer" on the tile, L7: 1921 vacancies
"Software Engineer" on the tile, L6: 10406 vacancies

At L8 the title will no longer contain data scientist or software engineer, it will be Director Of <field>, <org>, there are 136 open roles L8 at Amazon US.   

When you reach L7 doesn't mean the salary is frozen, we are reviewed every year, where bumps to baseline salary and bonuses are thrown at us. Last year I got maxim review rank and they threw at me 17% salary increase + 40% bonus on stocks (which now is more like 0,40%).

  

Best!

Felipe,
How is Amazon after a year+ in the grind?  I have finally sold Analytics Fire to R-Zero, they have some pretty unique viral disinfection technologies, I have high hopes they will make me filthy rich too  :-).  I would love to catch up in the next weeks to tell you about it, and get your input on my next ideas too.

Cheers,
