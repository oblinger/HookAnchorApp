This would be particularly true if we had independent knowledge about how this other universe worked, since we could systematically look for known target ideas in its reasoning that could have only come from Type-II ideation.  I am working on a side project "Alien Biology" that could serve this purpose.  The idea is ...


look specifically would know specifically what new ideation we should be looking for.
