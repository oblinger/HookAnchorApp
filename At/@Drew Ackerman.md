### 2023-04-29  The 3am Scoot-master-2000


THE SCOOT-MASTER 3AM BRAIN-BLASTER

I am a many-year veteran with specialized sleep-with-me setup...  Thought I would share.

I have little trouble falling asleep, but if I wake after several of sleep hours, I can easily waste HOURS trying to get BACK to sleep.
So this setup ensures a heavy dose of scooter before I even know what hit me, often I am back to sleep in under 5 minutes.

The key is getting the podcast started within seconds of realizing you are awake, without sitting up in bed, moving around, or even a couple of second of bright lights.
All it takes is 60 seconds of me thinking about my latest project, its enough to wake me, so that even more thinking will happen.
And even 10 seconds of bright lights are enough to drop melatonin levels... I can feel the difference.

Each night I slip on my bluetooth headset/eye mask, and don't do anything else.
Then if I wake with a single button push I am guaranteed to get exactly one episode played then shut off.
If I wake again, I can long press next and I will get another episode.


Its sounds simple, but it was not.  Before this many things could go wrong leaving me looking at a bright screen, and spending enough time login onto my device and fiddling with the app, next thing I know I am AWAKE!  Crap!  Here is my setup:

- I use a old i-Pad that is dedicated mostly for this activity.
- I tried more than a dozen podcast players before I found that I could configure Player FM so it would only play a single episode and shut off.
   (many players have this feature, but you need to login, then enable that feature EACH TIME you play an episode.  FAIL!)
- I use the XXX bluetooth eyemask.  I have tried more than six types, this one has its controls OUTSIDE the fabric so you are struggling to hit the buttons or to be sure if you really did hit the button (as the player is delayed in reacting)



All of you almost have this, but you need to sit up and mess with your player device, at least some of the time.



Sound simple, but its not.  


it is set so that with a single button on the eyemask scooter will play


I always go to bed with a bluetooth headset/eyemask on and connected 


also drops your melatonin levels very quickly
