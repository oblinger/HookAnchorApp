## 2025-10-30  Behavioral AI Role

I’m reaching out about a confidential CTO opportunity for an ambitious company pioneering a **new scientific field of AI within Behavioural AI** & **Authentication**.  
  
They’re developing systems that move beyond processing inputs to understanding context in real time, with applications across security and enterprise.  
  
The business is an early-stage company but well-backed ($6.5M raised, $50M seed funding in motion). They are looking to secure the best partner, engaging with Tier-1 and corporate venture capital firms, including the likes of NVIDIA Venture Capital.  
  
My client is already running enterprise pilots. The next step is to scale to global, low-latency performance and translate research into production-grade systems.  
  
We are looking for an exceptional candidate with  
  
● 10+ years technical leadership, with 5+ in AI/ML at scale.  
● Proven track record in both frontier research and production systems (deployed to millions).  
● Deep expertise in modern ML frameworks, transformers, LLMs, multimodal systems, and distributed architectures.  
● Experience scaling engineering teams from 10 → 100+, ideally across geographies.  
● Proven experience at the frontier of AI — whether through leading roles in top research labs or scaling high-growth AI companies  
● Thrives at startup pace — scrappy, resourceful, and able to balance 0→1 with 1→100.  
● A natural storyteller who can turn technical depth into investor and market confidence.  
  
This is a **true co-founder-level Global CTO position** with a **substantial equity package**, reflecting the impact of a partner who will shape both the scientific and commercial future of the organisation.  
  
Would you be open to a brief MS Teams call to explore? Please note that I am based in London.  
  
I appreciate your consideration, and rest assured, we will hold any discussions in strict confidence.  
  
Please let me know either way.  
  
Thanks  
  
Nik Patel  


Hi Dan  
  
Firstly, my apologies for the delay in coming back to you. I was awaiting an update from my client.  
  
Just wanted to get back to you and update you with the key elements of the role that we are searching against to ensure you remain open to the consideration.  
  
We’re currently partnering with an exceptional CEO/Founder who is pioneering a new field within Behavioural AI, and we’re looking to identify a forward-thinking, experienced CTO to join him on this journey with an exciting opportunity to build the next Unicorn business. This is a compelling and exciting opportunity to help shape a business at the forefront of AI innovation.  
  
We’re specifically seeking candidates based in San Francisco who have direct experience scaling global technology teams, ideally within AI business, from 10 to 100+. Startup experience within the AI space is strongly desirable, given the pace and ambition of the organisation. From what I’ve seen of your background, it seems you may align well with what we’re looking for, but I’d love to explore this further to see if it’s the right fit before arranging an introductory call.  
  
The organisation is in the final stages of its seed funding round, which is expected to conclude in the coming weeks, and the CEO is keen to start meeting potential candidates for an informal coffee chat to explore mutual fit and start informal conversations.  
  
Ahead of that, I’d arrange a short Teams video call with myself to ensure alignment and share more context on the opportunity if the above resonates.  
  
I’d love to hear your thoughts and whether you’d be open to a conversation in the coming days.  
  
Thanks  
  
Nik
