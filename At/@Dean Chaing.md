Dean:

Sorry for the delay; below is my resume, which I wanted to update, but my day job kept getting in the way!
You mentioned a colleague I might chat with before talking with the hiring manager regarding this open manager job.
I think that would be great.  I have spent years doing and managing guys building novel ML/CV algorithms.
It seems like I might have an interesting conversation!






Here is a resume, and here is my linkedin

## 2025-10-23  Working at Verb


  Intuitive Surgical's Major AI & Computer Vision Research Directions (2024-2025)

  1. Da Vinci 5 Platform - Core AI Infrastructure

  10,000x computing power vs previous generation
  - Foundational computing architecture for AI/ML workloads
  - Real-time machine vision processing
  - Edge computing for low-latency surgical decision support

  2. Computer Vision & Advanced Imaging

  4K+ resolution, 4x pixel density
  - 3D scene reconstruction in real-time
  - Anatomical structure identification and tracking
  - Instrument tracking and pose estimation
  - Tissue characterization (healthy vs diseased)
  - Depth perception and spatial awareness

  1. Case Insights - Surgical Data Science Platform

  This is a MAJOR focus area
  - Video + kinematic analysis: Processing surgical videos with robot motion data
  - Surgical workflow recognition: Identifying phases/steps of procedures
  - Objective skill assessment: Quantifying surgeon performance
  - Outcome prediction: Correlating technique with patient outcomes
  - Best practice identification: Mining data to find optimal approaches

  2. Autonomous Capabilities Research

  Partnership with Johns Hopkins & Stanford
  - Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for surgical understanding
  - Autonomous suturing - trained on 20 hours of surgical video
  - Tissue manipulation - semi-autonomous lifting/handling
  - "Augmented Dexterity": AI-suggested surgical maneuvers with human approval

  3. Force Feedback + Haptics (AI-Enhanced)

  New in da Vinci 5
  - ML models for force prediction and rendering
  - Tactile intelligence for tissue interaction
  - Collision detection and safety monitoring

  4. Multi-Modal Data Fusion

  - Combining robot sensor data + patient records + imaging
  - Pre-operative planning with AI
  - Intra-operative guidance systems
  - Post-operative analytics

  5. Informatics Platform (Orpheus Medical Acquisition)

  - Hospital-wide surgical data integration
  - Analytics dashboard for hospitals
  - Population-level insights

  Key Talking Points for Your AI Manager Discussion:

  Strategic Priorities:

  6. Scaling from research to product - Moving academic collaborations to commercial features
  7. Real-time inference - Low-latency AI for intra-operative use
  8. Regulatory pathway - FDA clearance for AI-assisted features
  9. Data flywheel - Leveraging 17% procedure growth (2024) for training data

  Technical Challenges They're Solving:

  - Generalization across procedures, surgeons, anatomies
  - Safety & validation for medical-grade AI
  - Explainability for surgeon trust
  - Privacy & data governance with surgical video

  Hot Research Areas:

  - Foundation models for surgical video understanding
  - Reinforcement learning for robot control
  - Federated learning across hospital sites
  - Digital twins for surgical simulation

  Questions to Ask/Topics to Connect On:

  10. "How are you approaching the transition from Case Insights analytics to real-time guidance?"
    - Shows you understand their current product vs research gap
  11. "What's the vision for integrating VLMs into the da Vinci 5 computing platform?"
    - References recent Hopkins/Stanford research
  12. "How do you balance autonomous capabilities with surgeon control and regulatory requirements?"
    - Shows understanding of medical AI challenges
  13. "What role does synthetic data play in your training pipeline given limited surgical video datasets?"
    - Advanced ML perspective
  14. "Are you building surgical-specific foundation models or adapting general vision models?"
    - Relevant to 2025 AI trends

  Your Basketball CV Experience - Connection Points:

  - Sports highlight detection → Surgical event detection (same CV primitives)
  - Real-time video processing (similar latency requirements)
  - Action recognition (player actions → surgical gestures)
  - Multi-camera fusion (if applicable)
  - Edge deployment for low latency

  Frame it as: "The problems are surprisingly similar - identifying critical moments in continuous video streams, tracking objects/instruments through occlusions, and doing it
   all in real-time with limited compute."

  Company Context:

  - 7,000+ da Vinci systems installed worldwide
  - 17% procedure growth in 2024 = massive data advantage
  - Da Vinci 5 launch "well ahead" of expectations (2024)
  - Heavy academic partnerships (Hopkins, Stanford, Berkeley)

  What position level is the AI Manager role - team lead, director, or senior IC? That would help me refine the talking points further!
