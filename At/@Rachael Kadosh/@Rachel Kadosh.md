## 2025-09-10  Job Chat

Rachel, indeed now is a good time for us to chat. Over the last year, I have been at an extended crossroad, the issues extend beyond purely career in a way that I think fits well into your coaching.  


Here is my context:

My career and life plans really fell apart with COVID and with the AI revolution.  The silver lining that it has focused me on neglected parts of my life.  I had planned to use Analytics Fire to make enough money that I never needed to work traditional jobs again.

I have several passion companies that I would have loved to pursue, but those are on the back burner for now or forever.  This took years to really come to terms with.  But the reality is I am 60 years old with a working wife 12 years my junior, a 6 year old son in private school, and a $20K/month burn rate.  So retiring with my $3.5M and our additional $1.5M may well not be an option.

For the moment, I am trying to do a back flip back into the corporate world after being out of it for 15 years in startups.
This is hampered by the shift in AI towards newer techniques than when I got my PhD, and the general tightening that AI has caused, especially in mid-manager hiring, where I would most naturally fit.


Issues to focus on:
- My efforts in job searching have not been efficient for reasons that might be worth digging into.

## 2020-12-17 Jason Negotiation

  
Rachael,

There are several topics worth covering:
-- Dan's Mission-hobby
-- Dan's Disposition
-- Negotiation with Jason -- Basketball 



### DAN'S MISSION-HOBBY

**TL;DR. I am weirdly and extremely driven by this hobby-mission which may never win financially. EXTREMELY driven, and I feel I have been side-tracked multiple times from working on it. I worry about that happening again here.**


-- About 20 years ago, I had some thoughts about how information is shared among specialists. (programmers, biologists, or really any knowledge workers.)

-- Like the characters in the old movie "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". I have been building toy versions of this idea "I saw in my dreams". at various points as a hobby during these years.

-- I know many engineers that have some "big idea" which turns out to be mostly in their imagination, or are impractical for one reason or another.

So I have to acknowledge that there is definitely risk of this happening here.

-- Still 10 years ago I left DARPA thinking I had two important ideas in my head. This is one of them. (The other one is how to build a conscious AI... this one seemed the more understood of the two)

-- But I also felt I should do a startup first this is on more immediate/practical/simpler ideas, so that is what I did. And put my hobby mission again for 3 years.

-- After that, and with a new and current co-founder (Nick) I tried to find other businesses that were practical, and did to a bit of work on my idea. (maybe 6 months, but very part time)

-- At one point 5 years ago, my co-founder said, ``Dan I have seen you when you are excited about something, and you are not excited about this stuff. You should pick an idea that really excites you and just DO IT.'' That was all the encouragement I needed. I grabbed this info sharing idea and started RUNNING with it. It was a glorious 4 months. Working from 7 in the morning 'till 10 at night, only to repeat that next day -- seven days a week. I was running fast because I felt that practicalities would stop me. And it did:

-- I got the Robotics startup position. I was torn about what to do, and fearful I would never get back to my idea. but that was so much more practical, so I did it. I accepted the CTO role saying ``I would only work 1/3 time.'' (this was silly thinking).

-- As the leader of the tech team, that was just a crazy belief for me to have. And once we were really in motion I was all in on the robot. It was stressing me out to try to work 70+ hours and then ALSO make progress on my hobby mission. So I explicitly put it on the shelf. (Again)

-- that company was bought by another company, and I lead the new much larger team for much larger pay. Very, Very stressful, very cool.

-- But I begin saying out loud to my girlfriend who is now my wife. `` Yeah I am doing this now, but every day I survive is three days that I can have no job.'' (Dreaming of resuming my hobby-mission)

-- We got married and I resigned from that job there were lawyers involved it was messy. Still I had made good money, and build a cool robot, and a cool engineering team.

-- During these years Nick my current co-founder had been growing our company, so I committed to "earning my 1/2" of the company and also working on my hobby-mission. At the same time.

-- but getting married, and new car, and trying to drive our business forward, then having a baby, and I was making lack luster progress on my mission-hobby. Further I began to realize that I don't understand parts of my hobby-mission that I had thought were solved.

-- At about 1.5 years in I decided to pause my hobby and focus on driving my business with Nick.

-- After a 6 month pause this did not feel great. I am not making good money with Nick, and our business is struggling to find its north star.

-- And I am not using my PhD in Machine Learning, and I am not working on my Mission. So what AM I doing here?

  

-- Then I resolved, well even if my mission-hobby is a very technical and impractical thing, I didn't care. If I was going to end up going back to Google and making a money writing some sub-module, to a side-thing that optimizes some tiny product feature, at least I will have written this darn language and built it enough of my hobby-mission that I can play with it on the side while slaving away at google. But I knew with a child at home, and house, wife, and business I was going to have to be dedicated. So I shifted my schedule, I now wake at 5am and try to get in 4 focused hours of work before 10am... I don't watch TV, or anything else in the evenings, I never go out. My hacking, my son, my co-founder job, and household dutys are IT. And with each of those duties I strip them down the BARE essentials. So I am getting in 40+ hours /week using both weekend days, and every waking minute that is not otherwise occupied on my hobby mission, and jamming everything else in there too. Even at dinner, I will find my mind traveling to details on the hobby-mission that need to be worked out.

  

-- I am sprinting all out, because I know that life will interrupt this again. I just don't know when. -- and I am sprinting all out, because making weekly progress on this leviathan is intrinsic motivation beyond any other that I know. 

  

-- My wife is generally supportive, she is also a hard worker, and she is from China where the dads works like crazy. BUT, I am intentionally careful to obfuscate from nearly everyone (including her), what I am working on. It is too impractical, too abstract.

-- Struggling to make your own business succeed is a goal that folks can understand. Even if they know you could just make more money working at google, folks (and wife) understand maybe you would prefer to work for yourself--so explaining it that way seems most practical. I have saved plenty of money, so these days I "pay" myself a salary into the family bank account from my personal pre-marriage savings. So I am paying my own way, but my wife knows we could have more, if I just did some PhD work for one fo the big guys. 

-- Mostly she is supportive, and she knew what she was getting into prior to the marriage. Its just that she does have expensive tastes and we could have more. 

  

-- But the biggest gap, and why I generally don't tell folks is because my REASON for doing it does not compute for others. I am not doing it because I thing it is a good path to getting rich. It is hard to change behaviors, and this thing requires changes -- ones that I likely do not yet understand.

-- Indeed if it works as a social community at all (which it very well may not), then it might end up being a non-profit -- little money for me there. 

-- I feel like I am doing it because it is a beautiful idea, and it should just exist. and against odds I feel maybe I can get it "out there" in an impactful way.

-- I am doing it, because it is like a puzzle that once you hear it, you cannot stop thinking about it, until you solve it. Just for the sake of having solved it.

-- I am doing it, because it seems this is a unique area where I see a thing that few others see with enough clarity to build it.

  

-- Even to write this to you, takes courage to not delete a few of these lines. I imaging talking with you few years hence and STILL having nothing I can show, ``Dan, so what ever happened with that "big" thing?'' . have nothing to show, either because it was too big, or because I got paused again, or I was just muddle headed all along. (But hey, I am not getting my money's worth if I don't lay it all out there.)

  

-- These last 5 months of working from 5am have been FUN. I have a key programmed on my keyboard so I can swap my screen when others (mostly the wife) might approach. She just sees this as working very hard to make my business succeed.... and I am also putting in 20 hours per week my business too. and have daily chores with my son and house.

  

-- You may tell me that I should be more honest with my wife. Perhaps so, but getting married has be a tough thing... I now have lots of responsibilities on me... and ones that do not seem to deliver back to me a feeling that resonates with me. I just live a life of obligations--they are not so onerous or unreasonable, but they are just obligations, to visit friends, do the trash, play with my son Eli. If I am being honest, most all of these things just feel like obstacles to making progress. Everything it about time, and everything takes time.

-- I am growing in honest love of doing some stuff with my Son, but the wings of time beat loudly, so it is hard to really relax into that.

-- Still I feel if I can make progress on my mission each week, then at least for the moment, I am ok enough with all else that life puts upon me.

  

-- These last 5 months have seen good progress on the mission-hobby. I realize how much of it, I did not understand before, and how much clearer it has become. there are several output that could be less than a year away:

-- The beginnings of a knowledge management tool. (like asana, trello, mind map, or one of these) but way way more adaptable 

-- The beginnings of a code sharing community (like github if you have heard of this)

  

These are very difficult businesses to enter. Big players spend hundreds of millions. It is not an ideal choice as a business target.

But I am not sure that a for-profit business is even the correct output. Maybe a non-profilt market-place for shared knowledge work. Such a thing does not really exist, so there are great risks that it will not catch on.

  

So here are the outcome probabilities as I understand them:

25% -- I am just out to lunch, and / or I can get ZERO interesting or community-traction or business.

25% -- It is nerd-awesome. When nerds see this they say ``woah, that is amazing'' and it lives on for me as a nerd hobby of but it is quite obscure and makes nearly on the world.

25% -- It is super complex to build a business from it, Still it turns out to have differentiated value. And I do manage to build a reasonable lifestyle business from it.

25% -- There is a clearly-sustaining strong business that comes from this. (5% chance that it is game changing in the way that knowlege-workers do their work)

  

I don't know. I just really want to get it written down so even I can look at it and understand what it is.

  

I admit this is an irrationally slim, elusive target to put so much energy towards.

  

  

    ~~~~~~~~~~~

### DAN'S DISPOSITION




I am an alley cat, as my co-founder describes both himself and myself. I don't want to have to work on a thing that I am told I must work on, but rather want to wander to it, and find those ideas that drive me.

When I do get connected to an idea, it will DRIVE me. even as I looked back-over my shoulder at my hobby-mission on the shelf, I was quite devoted to the robot as we were building it. I am a worker... but its gotta be the work that some how comes from in me.

-- When push comes to shove, I seem to be driven to sacrifice most everything else -- but if I feel I have room, then I can appreciate other things and not be so one-dimensional.

-- It is likely best if I can have a schedule that has significant room for such driving interests, and significant freedom to choose what I am driving towards.

If I achieve this is a stable/long-term way, then I think I can relax, and other things can become important to me too.

  

I feel I have lost a lot in the marriage/child equation. There was perhaps a bit of duplicity on her part before the marriage, and now we have a child, so I am pretty committed to making it work.

I think it will all be ok, if I manage to preserve that creative outlet and/or preserve a technical-oriented mission I believe in.

I think if I loose that mission then life would just become all work and more work. (NOTE: I can have other missions besides my hobby mission),

It seems a danger lurks in the shadows here.

  

My current co-founder job:

-- As I said, my company has not found its north star. Last year we paid me $44K and my co-founder $120K. Both he and I have wifes that make more than double his salary. So ultimately this business will fail if we don't figure it out.

But I think we have a greater than 60% chance of pivoting into more profit... one way or another.

-- I do hope for this, because then I could work on my mission-hobby or my next tech-mission forever. Maybe one of these hobbies has a notable impact, or is a successful business. but either way, this is what I am supposed to do... I think.

-- Both Nick and I would like to turn this into a lifestyle thing. Enough to support our wives SF-lifestyle and give us freedom. (His wife is a Stanford MBA, while mine is only a U Mich MBA, so he has it worse in the sense that his wife's friends all run in gold-plated circles.... mine works a Google, that is bad enough). For him and I, we just want enough money to do cool stuff.... both are from poor fly-over states -- so we care far less for these things.

  

  

    ~~~~~~~~

### THE BASKET BALL JOB

  

Here is the opportunity my colleague from DARPA is trying to get me to join him on:

  

-- Use fancy AI - Machine learning to watch a basketball game thru a cheap wall mounted camera and keep track of details stats about who pass the ball to whom, and did it result in a basket. there are hundreds of sub-stats like percent of successful blocks when 10 feet from the basket on the left rear, etc. today this is done manually at the college and pro-levels.

  

his idea is we can build a cheap device and put it into gyms and charge teams for their stats. this is especially awesome business model since one device can service twenty adult league teams that are already paying significant dues to be at the gym.

It is unusual in that the gym does not need to pay anything so early evidence is that getting them to say yes is easier. And once in the gym, it automatically is advertising to all teams in the gym (using a freemium model)

cost of new customer acquisition kills most consumer ideas unless you have a big brand -- this solves that problem.

  

  

-- I love the idea, and if I thought of it, I would just go do it without trying to partner with him. He is not essential to the idea:

-- KEY PART #1 -- The two key parts of the idea are the technical part -- no one has done this fancy AI yet -- and this is my speciality -- my PhD applies directly here.

-- KEY PART #2 -- The other part of the idea is the channel-insider who has spent their career selling into gyms, and into high school basketball teams.

-- He is neither of these people, though is IS a successful CEO and has access to investor money and we likely need it later.

-- But morally it does not matter, I will not go and do an idea that he brought to me. thus either I will join him, or support him as a friend.

  

So how much is an idea worth? 

  

My current thinking is to push for a ratio of 3:2 between his equity and mine.

-- I think he will not go for this ratio, but I am not sure.

-- My reason strike a high bar is really opportunity cost. It is true this is a better idea than any I have now. But I have so little control with him as my boss, whereas with another idea that I ran with Nick, we could structure this as we liked.

-- So the jason partnership is inferior in that way.

-- If I did have an idea that I ran with Nick, or more on my own, I would likely have double the equity I would have with Jason, and live in control of my life.

-- But this idea feels like it wins, and few ideas feel that way. Still this is just an idea. ZERO work has been done on it. So how much of an credit to Jason and loss of control to I want to have to get it?

-- I have arranged for my team to get a little equity to work on this problem with me. this would soften the blow. I would have more control and freedom with my own team, but I should not kid myself. If I do this, I will get sucked in, and will "come back" 3 years later. Maybe with a equity that will be worth something someday.

  

  

Another approach:

-- I could also try to get a burst of equity for getting him started. Maybe 10% for first six months. this has the benefit of being pretty time-limited, and if his idea is big, then it is still alot of money some day.

  

  

I am confused after writing this. One goal was to have freedom to work on ideas that I find compelling. this one would be pretty cool if it was being quickly adopted, but I think I would be disappointed to be absorbed totally for years. I will become too old at some point to be able execute my hobby-mission. But am I really so driven on it that i would walk away from a job that likely I would really prefer to a google job?

  

more confused, but at a higher level.😉

  

talk tomorrow!


## 2020-12-16  Jason Negotiation
Rachael,

  

I have a fast moving negotiation, if it is possible for us to intersect tomorrow (Thursday), then I would love to have a session with you.  If not, I understand.  I know this is not how you normally work, so I totally understand if that meeting is not possible. (I may be able to stretch to Friday if that helps)

  
  

Here are the relevant details in case we can meet  (no need to read if we cannot meet):

  

A good friend, Jason, who was also a PM at DARPA when I was there has exited his company and it retired.  He came to me with an idea to use deep learning (AI stuff) to identify detailed stats that school teams collect manually (e.g. how often does player 27 successfully block a basket, etc.)

  

The idea is that we could build a cheap device to put in gyms, and sell the data to the teams that play there.  I think the idea has legs, but morally I will not work on this idea w/o him since he brought it to me.  Also I would only want to do it if I could use my engineering team (at my own company) to back me up.  My current co-founder Nick has agreed to accept 7% equity as payment for work that our team would do for the company.  

  

So WE will be working at our own personal risk on Jason’s idea in return for 7%.  Will cost us about $100K to do this, but we can stop anytime if we don’t think the idea is going to succeed.

  

But Jason really wants me personally to co-found with him, my company is mostly a nuisance to get me -- though he appreciates avoiding needing to raise $300K and find an alternate team.

  
  

Very narrowly, I need to decide what equity amount will demand for joining.  My situation is pretty unique.  PhD in a specialty which is right at the center of the technical fanciness of this idea.  Also he counts me as one of two or three “super” founder partner in the world.  AND I am talking about working for FREE during this time, so it saves raising money for a fancy PhD guy.

  

But Jason thinks quite highly of himself too.  A bit over-valued in my opinion in the current context since the two key requirements for this business are depth in the vision-ML tech, and a rolodex and experience in basket-ball related sales channels.  He has neither.  He has the idea, and I won’t steal it from him.  So I at a minimum I need to negotiate an equity slice with him that I am happy with.  And I am ready to walk away if it is not good enough.

  

This idea seems to have a unique way to market to many teams with one device, making this business much easier to scale the most device businesses.  So I am willing to pay a premium to get in on this idea, but how much?

  

More complex is the fact that this has notable opportunity cost, I am doing other things at my current company, and have goals I want to pursue that this will put on hold.

  

So I think both a strategy for negotiation and discussion if I should do it at all are both in order.

  

~~

Here is a nominal Cap Table on Day 1, Jason is at 58%, but will drop to 43% if we hire a marketing person later next year.

  

58% Jason  (reduces to 43% if later we hire a channel market “third founder” below)

15% Third “founder”

30% Dan

7% AF

5% employee pool

  
  

~~

  

On the topic of opportunity cost:

  

I am making very little money right now, and spending my savings to be in my current company.

I am working on an idea that I love, which has a 30-50% chance of becoming a business, otherwise it is a non-profit tech organization.  (It is the seed for software collaboration w/o working for corporations -- think open-source software, but everyone is getting paid.)

I love this idea…  I have been delayed in working on it multiple times in the last decade, and fear that being married with a kid, I may loose my chance to complete it and have to go work for google.  Doing this business with Jason threatens to delay me AGAIN.  But it seems within 6 months we should have a pretty strong idea if it will succeed, and it could also be the way I never have to work for google.

  

On the third hand, if I manage to find a business with Nick (my current co-founder) that is a safer path to owning my one life, and working on my side gig while building our business.  Nick is happen to allow me to dial up and down my effort (and he and I agree on how to dial up and down my pay).  Jason is going to push for wild success, so for some period, I will have less control for sure -- but probably more control than if I went to work for google.



## 2018-05-18 Exiting Aeolus

Rachel,  
  
Your advice has always been so insightful.  Of course I would think back at moments of inflection.  
My current context is a bit involved, and I may be taking precipitous action so it is the right time to ask.  
  
Still it is a bit difficult to convey the nuance of the situation …. I will do my best.  
In th end of course I will take your response with a grain of salt given you knowledge of the situation, mostly I find your ability to see important ways to frame a decision as a great asset, perhaps that can be applied with even just an email?  
  
—dan  
  
I need to select between option #1 and option #2.  
Also see my proposed email.  I also need to decide if I “reply all” to his email, so that I am very publicly asking to get my equity.  
I do worry that later he will have other stories about why I am gone, if he decides to not give me the equity promised.  
  
  
~ ~ ~ ~ ~   
  
  
MY CONTEXT  
— 3 years ago I co-founded a robotics company, now I am a co-founder/CTO of a company that ate the first one.  
— I did not really trust the leader of the second company so I followed your advice:  I picked a huge salary that I could not say no too.  
— They said ``yes’’ so for the last 1.5 years I have been making $1 million/year.  (Pretty good salary for a startup 😉 )  
— I hired 60+ people and delivered a successful robot after only 13 months into the national CES annual conference.  
— Still the CEO views this performance to be sub-standard and my ability to be the CTO of a billion dollar company to be currently insufficient (but still possible)  
  
  
— After 1.5 years later they still  did not every sign the paperwork for the equity that I was promised when I joined.  
    And the job has been quite emotionally painful.   (And I have never worked harder in my life)  
— The leader is extremely hard driving, and not happy with our progress (he blames me as CTO among others too)  
    He does correctly point to limitations in my performance, but he is quite misguided in his expectations regarding what is possible, and thus  
     Drives the company in bad/risky directions based on this faulty understanding.   (Of course this is my personal opinion, but it is shared by others)  
— The company is in some trouble, only $10M left in the bank and burning $1M+ per month.  
— The CEO asked the leadership team to take a 50% pay cut.  (My pay alone is 10% of the cost of a 140+ person company!!)  
    (No one else knows my salary since it is crazy large, he does not want others to know)  
  
  
Option #1 — I politely demand to be given vested equity since I am being treated like a founder (accepting a 50% pay cut) … I should have a stake in outcome.  
— Note: I can probably get the same 500K/yr or better from Amazon/Google/etc. etc. based on my technical skills  
— The job is a bit toxic (though it is better than before)  
— Now is probably my best chance to get equity — they do not want to loose their CTO while fund raising.  
— Later they can fire me, save my $500K salary and pay smaller equity to another once company is stablished.  
— They can blame it on my incompetence, then give less money and less equity to another CTO since the company will be well established.  
  
  
Option #2 — dont say anything.  Accept the $500K (which is still respectable) and dont work my self to the bone as I have been doing.  
— Things have degraded since year one, and I already have limited scope of responsibility, still the CEO claims that he hopes to train me and then   
    Re-establish by former scope.  (He might be being honest in this statement, but even so, he does not recognize that his aims are   
    Not attainable in most cases, so climbing back up to the top will require me figuring out how to inject reality in his goals so we   
    can be achieving them.  I am not sure about the likelihood I can learn this.)  
— I just got married (hooray) and I have some ideas for my next big thing.  I can work on those while working much less hard at this company.  
   It provides $500/yr (which I do not need in short run) and a justification for what I am doing with my time.  (Which playing with my next big   
   thing does not provide in such a simple to understand way.). So emotionally still earning a paycheck is easier than working on a thing w/o one.  
— There is always a chance that things turn around, and if I demand equity right now, quite possibly everything will blow up.  
— DETAIL:  they convinced me to accept a TWO year vesting cliff when I joined.  This means in theory I could be given equity now and then terminated before   
    it vests this October.  My solution to this is to demand VESTED equity.  I can ague that we should count the two year vesting based on the start date of the   
    FIRST company. He may not buy this interpretation, but at least I can argue that it is owed to me, and he can argue the first company does not count for vesting.  
    (Morally I can argue it is wrong for me to work almost 3 years and get no equity.  This is mostly for purposes of the court of public opinion.)  
  
  
Doing nothing allows the train to keep moving.  But after some period of months I predict that it will not be great if I am not super committed.  
Then I might loose the moral high ground of walking out at a point where they are stiffing me on both salary and equity.  
  
In my head I imagine speaking to the next employer and I worry that I will want to talk about the 100+ people I hired and am managing here, but will not want them to talk with my current CEO.  (The first company CEO would be GREAT).  Telling them that I walked out when they stiffed me on equity is a great argument for why they would not talk with him.  
  
  
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Sending the letter below may light the fuse, either I get equity or I end up out of Aeolus ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  
  
Alex,  
  
As you have commented multiple times in the past, I am among the most dedicated at Aeolus — of course as one of the founds this is entirely natural.  Also taking a 50% pay cut at a critical point is entirely natural too.  
  
Still after almost three years of working on this robot, I still do not have the paperwork signed for the equity that we agreed to when I joined.  
  
Now there have been many good reasons for these delays so I am not criticizing.  Still accepting a 50% pay cut is something that should happen in the context of vested equity — I should have a guaranteed formalized stake in the company.  
  
Let me know what we should do to move forward on this,  
—dan  
  
  
  
p.s.  by the tone of this email you can tell there is some tension within the founding team.  My position is not secure, or safe/happy feeling.  
But it pays and we have done some impressive things… good to be associated… assuming it does not explode in a fiery mess.

### Response From Rachel

Yes, take everything below with a grain of salt!  These are thoughts for your consideration--in NO WAY TO BE CONSTRUED AS RECOMMENDATIONS--I simply do not have enough context without a conversation.  Also, I am still very much under the weather--so I will leave it 100% up to you to determine how cogent the thoughts are!  Note: my questions below are intended to be reflections for you--not to initiate ongoing emails between us J

How clear are you re: what you want?  What would be ideal?  How clear are you re: your bottom-line of what is acceptable?  Getting crystal clear about these things will inform you. 

How critical is your reputation to achieving what you want next?  What might you do to protect it?  

Prior to sending an email, I’d rather you have a discussion with him to better understand what the CEO ultimately wants.  

What does the CEO ideally want from you?  (To leave?  To step up and ‘deliver’ differently in a manner you believe to be unrealistic?)  What does the Board ideally want?  If you don’t know, how might you find out?  Knowing what they want helps inform you re: your power or lack of it in the situation, as well as leverage points.  Making demands only works if they want to keep you…this might be the CEO’s way of pushing you out.  That would be great to know--then you can negotiate a win-win exit.  What do you ideally need to position yourself for your next venture?  Is this something you can openly request?  Particularly if he wants you to leave…coming up with a win-win exit (ie: phasing out over a period of time--with some of the promised equity).

What keeps you from getting a bit of option #1 and option #2?  What if you proceed acting as if of course they will still provide equity? and position yourself as most concerned with the company’s long term success--with or without you?  What if the letter to Alex is framed in terms of a win-win?  ALSO, know your bottom-line--would you take a one-year vest starting now?  What would best serve the company?   

Another take: what if you approach this from a place of inquiry?  A candid discussion with the CEO--again, emphasizing your desire for the long-term success of the co.  Note: in my opinion, being objective/unemotional in your approach, and able to control your emotions throughout the conversation, maximizes the likelihood of success of this approach.  No defensiveness.  Just a place of grounded curiosity.   What will best serve the company?  At what point do you believe it will make sense to give me the equity?  What, if anything, keeps us from signing the papers now?

Imagine your friend is asking you for advice about this situation…you are completely unemotional about it…so how do you advise him?

Another consideration: Is there a way to turn around the CEO’s perception of what is possible?  Hiring a consultant he trusts who will ultimately back you up?  

Congrats on your marriage!!!—and please do keep me posted re: what happens! 

Best,
