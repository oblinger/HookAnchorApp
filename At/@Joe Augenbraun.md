Subj:  Letter of Reference

Joe,
I am winding things up at Analytics Fire, the acquisition is nearly done, and I managed to avoid any handcuffs.  I am going to do some interviewing, and would love to get a letter of reference from you.  I think we worked really well together and I am proud of what we built too, so I think it would be great to talk about that with prospective employers.  Let me know if you have the time to do one for me.

Also I would love to get together for a coffee or lunch sometime.  I have been struggling a bit in orienting myself for what comes next.  Its is alway fun to chew that fat and about such stuff from time to time.   I am not sure how often you are in the city, but it has been ages since I saw you last!

let me know on that too.

Cheers, 
Dan


If it helps your thinking, I have included a couple of starter ideas, but of course you likely have your own thoughts to work from:
- Dan's enthusiasm to dive head first into helping me build the robot prototype needed for Bizzy's initial fund raising, 
- Dan breadth of hands on and theoretical knowledge across the wide range of AI and robotics as we needed.  (I think I have a pretty good pragmatic/business sense about our technical decision making, and that is coupled with a pretty deep more academic/theoretic understanding over a range of areas.
- Dan's integrity and enthusiastic drive helped him to forge and maintain a high functioning team.  Dan helped to create a combination of fast pace, individual autonomy, with a careful attention-to and respect-for each team member.
   (Indeed we hired Axel away from Apple as firmware engineer at half his previous salary on the basis of our work environment, team, and our project vision)

- Dan is an ideal CTO, problem solver, quickly digging to the root of a problem, and listening to and thinking thru the technical approaches one might use to resolve it.  He is the right balance of theoretical understanding and hands on action.  (duplicate framing as above)
