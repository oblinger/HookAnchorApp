### m2022-11-21  Conversation #2 ideas and pointers

NEXT STEPS:  Over the coming months we spoke about three ways to continue the conversation.  I am excited about that!
- CONTACTS: Opportunistically look for discussion partners Dan (with invitation for Teddy & Kryshiek's involvement in those call or not as your time and inclination allows)
- IDEAS:  Its clear you guys have lots of good ideas about the shape of EduCorp and also about businesses that might serve as its starting point.  I already have thoughts based on our call about 'freelance' style work that might require fewer assets and service richer communities.  will follow up separately about that, and I expect this will be an area where new ideas might come over time from both sides.
- COPY: Teddy, I will take you up on your offer to look at content I produce.  Feel free to do deep or cursory scans as your time and inclination allows.  It is clear that my 'antenna' is notably out of adjustment in several areas, so I think each time we interact I will be improving my ability to better see the vantage points of my different readers.  Thanks for this huge blessing!
