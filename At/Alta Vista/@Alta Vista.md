# GUIDING PRINCIPLES


## Limited at younger ages

AI technology is still a digital technology, and 


## Teaching the Fundamental AND Teaching the Tools



## The Three Domain Framing

- CONTROLLED AI - 
- UNFETTERED AI - 

## Flexibility / Resiliency

Replacement by those 


## Skepticism

The internet, social media, and AI all bring unprecidented amounts of conflicting information to our fingertips.  A cruicial skill





### 2024-11-15  AI Discussion

- INNOVATOR'S MINDSET: 
	- Entire industries will be transformed in a few years time, so being nimble will be key.
	- When the transition happens experience with AI tools will end up essential.

#### Understanding Who Is In The Room

- What brought you to this conversation about AI in education?
- What excites you most about the possibilities? What keeps you up at night?
- How is AI already affecting your children's learning and development?

#### Questions to Explore 

- What should be the relationship between AI and learning in a JK-8 environment?
- How do we ensure technology serves our educational values rather than reshapes them?
- What do we mean by "AI literacy" at different developmental stages?
- How do we balance embracing innovation with protecting childhood?

### 2024-09-24  Info management proposal

- Create a mailing list so it is impossible to "reply" to the whole mailing list.
- Create a unified email address for each parent.
- Create a unified resource tree for all AVS info.
	- manage distributed ownership of that tree.

- Structure correspondence to minimize number of messages to parents and ensure that most current info is always fully contained in any message ever set.

- Structure info by class, by grade, by topic, and by school so unified calendar, unified todo lists, and unified messaging exists.
