## 2025-12-12  Abuse Response


Response to Derrick PM from Analytics Fire


Gaaaa! That is shocking beyond comprehension. I can't imagine such a thing happening within the world of people I know.  I am so sorry to hear such a sad story. I am glad you are able to get help, though I am sure it will still be with you.  So sorry!

I don't think you owed me an explanation, but I am still very grateful to have received it.  It makes our friendship all the closer, and it does explain how things shifted for you over the years and what that meant in the work context.

There were a couple of times when your responses felt pretty distant; I certainly noticed.  Still, I knew that slowly losing your eyesight had to be pretty crazy traumatic in itself, so I never took any of this personally.  While you were at AF, Nick and I spoke a couple of times; it was with a bit of sadness that it seemed things were so emotionally challenging for you.

You were SO rock-solid for so many years; it was really noticeable when things dropped. We definitely felt loyalty to you as you clearly gave your all to the team.

Thanks for filling me in on the rest of the story. Even if it is a sad one, it is good to know it. AF is a forever kind of family, so it is nice to connect back with folks from time to time.

For me, my days are filled with activities with my son Eli, wife and dog....  and work of course.  Thus my social life has shrunk considerably.  Its nice to get the occasional blast from the past.


Have a blessed holiday, and thanks for sharing.
