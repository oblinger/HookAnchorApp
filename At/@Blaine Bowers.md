### 2023-10-10 Intro Call


STUFF WE DISCUSSED

VERIFY YOUR CREDITS WILL TRANSFER - You are counting on credits that you are doing now will eventually transfer with you try to get your bachelor's degree.

ANYTHING CONSULTING - You had the idea that "problem solving" is a satisfying kind of job for you, and it can also be part of many good careers.  So getting a any job that relies on problem solving is probably better than spending time at Rainbow Restoration long term.

Several ideas that we considered included:
- IT Consulting - Geek squad, Apple genius bar guy, etc. require training and certification, but being the "IT guy" for small businesses in your area could probably be done w/ less training.  If you still need basic expertise, but then I think many companies would take you on in a trial basis way.
- Business SW specialist - I think you were less excited about the option, but becoming a expert in some kind of SW could make you very valuable to companies that need to use this kind of SW.
- Cyber specialist - You need to talk with some experts first, but I bet there are certifications that you could train and pass after a couple of months of focused work.  Using such a certification you could get a job at a cyber firm.

CEVRON INTERNSHIP - One idea is that you might one day want to do something in robotics.  If so, getting that Chevron internship will be quite an important was to verify that you do want to do this, and it will help you get into the best program and best job.
