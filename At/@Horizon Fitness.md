- When is the end of my 30 days?  Which sub-model of treadmill do I have?
- Treadmill Shock
- 5K does not complete 5K.  2.3 miles then stopped
- FatBurn does not allow cool down
- 5K begins too slow (1.5m/h) and keeps adjusting back down


- [Ele Grounding](https://support.horizonfitness.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/4407925134989/Grounding_Kit_Installation_for_a_Treadmill.pdf)  

P1 is manual mode.


- Grounding
	- how to install the nut on the back
	- surge protector
	- wire to third hole
	- Kit needed  (what do those circuit boards for heart grips do?)
	- Where is static being built up
	- apply lubricant or such?
	- Figure L seems to be showing me a view inside the conveyor part of the treadmill, but no part of the instructions describe getting into that part.
	- Shoe:  
		- Nylon clothing, 
		- static guard, 
		- dry air in the home, 
		- wall outlet is not grounded, 
		- lube on the belt.
		- suge portector
		  
- 5K does not do 5K, it does 30 min.  WTF?
	- Just use distance?
	  
- Fatburn does not do cool down
	- 3-second reset is best we can do?
	- Use key reset.
	  
- Custom run seems to 'forget' plan.  does it need to be created EACH TIME?
