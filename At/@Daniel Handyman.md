Hi Dan, here's the quote for the repairs :  
  
-Bedroom corner walls and ceiling: open holes,clean,wood repair,seal,insulate,  
close,patch,texture,paint : $2500  
-Bedroom windows : repair drywall,texture/paint, drain water,seal  
window holes: $700  
-Siding repairs around the house : clean,repair,patch,seal prime and  
paint : $3800  
-Roof repairs: remove gravel,clean,repair tar/seal and  
flashing/gutters,re install gravel,  
skylight repair and seal : $3500  
-Supplies/material (for indoor and outdoor work) : $1000  
Total: $11500  
As we discussed, it all needs to be done when the weather conditions allow it.  
I'm estimating it'll take 10 days to do everything.  
If that works, we can schedule for April or May, let me know if you  
have any question.  
Thank you  
Best, daniel
