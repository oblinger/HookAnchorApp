### 2023-07-05 Ideas:


#### CUST SUPPORT

CUST SUPPORT 
Existing LLM models could be adapted to bridge between four corpora listed below in order to provide replacements for customer support agents in virtually every consumer facing business.  Here are the taxonomies I imagine capturing and leveraging:
- the many interfaces customer support agents use in any consumer facing org,
- a taxonomy of customer agendas, 
- a deep base of vertical-specific knowledge, and
- a broad base of knowledge regarding customer-agent interactions.

The result would be a low-code solution for replacing customer support agents in virtually every consumer facing business with always on, higher quality, cheaper agents.  Fusing these four sources of knowledge would replace level one and level two support in most orgs and interactions with senior support would be an ongoing source of performance improvement.  I suspect within a few short years having always available high quality voice support (which can actually resolve issues not just forward one onward) will be common place.

Phillip,

It looks like we have secured a healthy bridge round for Sports Visio.  This is exciting as it gives us almost two years run way; plenty to skate over any rough investor waters that might lie ahead.

Still, I can't shake the feeling that each day going by is one missed where I should be founding of one of the unicorns that will certainly be berthed in the immediate aftermath of our milestone with LLMs.  Below I include a thought regarding one of the directions that grab my attention.  But I know that it will only be those efforts with strong/fast tech teams that ALSO have strong positioning within their target markets that will win.  It would be folly for me to embark on anything without first securing at least tentative connections to such co-founders.  Thus I am eager to continue our conversation.  Let me know when you have time!

But as with other such ideas, I am long on technical approaches, and comparatively short on methods for building a team having some kind of unfair access to its market.  Your thoughts are welcome!
