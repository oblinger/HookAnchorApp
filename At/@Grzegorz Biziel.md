### 2025-06-12  Paper already written

Unfortunately, I was doing some research and it turns out that someone early this year released exactly the idea I was hoping to test.   [https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.08282](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.08282)

I only left myself to think that finding their paper was hard because they came with a new term "Language-Aligned Positional Embedding".

The paper is going to be presented at CVPR 2025 (so like right now). The code, model and dataset are going to be released later. Their model is a fine-tuned LLaVa, so a bit older model (I was aiming on Qwen2.5-VL).

### 2024-01-11  fixing the player ID

List of issues and ways to fix them
- Portion of a player so predictor is wrong.
	  ==>could train on overlaps
- Mix players from the colors. (loosing 10% wrong1%)
- Motion Blur (rarely shots happen in that area)
- people out of game can score better
	 ==> use homography

- Missing buckets - two games (one missing player)
- Phantom buckets
- Wrong bucket
	- OCR wrong color



### 2023-08-23  Better Gallery

We want a deep learned embedding space that well separates the players (e.g. like a normal embedding, but one that is computed thru multiple deep layers)

Like a normal embedding we use a gradient method to adjust its weights.  But in this cases
