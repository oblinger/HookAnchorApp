### m2023-01-24  Context Call


POLITICAL CONTEXT
- PERSONAL GOALS MOSTLY SATISFIED
	- I want to grow my 'hands on' technical strength some.
	- I am an pinch-hitter, ideas-guy more than a line management steward by skill, proclivity and desire.
	- Have most of the equity, cash and title that I will get already.
	- Is going to take skill, finesse to get report to structure anyway.  and may well bruise egos to do it.
	- STILL:
	- I would like practice with smooth running push to production role, instead of the R&D prototyping of my past.
	- More important, I have few critical goals on my plate prior to the A-round.
	- Less impactful for our immediate success.  Issue for delivering value, AND for company success.
- SO MAYBE
	- Mike, Key leader, is very chill, does not seem at all grabby--quasi-retired before this.  and naturally keeps to the R&D CV side of software.
	- Brian, key leader, on non-AI software side is just too junior to lead beyond his current scope.
	- SO MAYBE:  I can build trust with both and using very close relation with Jason to drive high-level objectives of both w/o managing them.
	- OR MAYBE:  Driving those objectives over time, I become defacto manager for them, and later become the actual manager.
	- OR MAYBE:  We hire an in the weeds VP of Eng that reports to me, and he over sees all of SW with them reporting somewhere...
	- MY PLAN:  Build strong alliances with both.  Focus on fomenting action on ground thru consensus & personal sweat for now, and see what happen over time.
	  ==> TRICKY PART:  person sweat can easily feel like I am usurping their authority especially as it will involve direct their reports (with their consent).
