### t2023-02-06  Meeting Prep

Indeed!  Here is a list, “shooting from the hip”  and I will come to our meeting with a slightly expanded and refined version of this.  
  
90-DAY PLAN - I have the beginnings of a 90-day plan.  I would love to get your thinking about my priorities and approach.  
  
THE PEOPLE - I have been in meetings with all the top folks already, and can give thoughts about how to operate with each.  
  
RED ALERTS - I have a “Red alerts” list of issues that are causing bleeding now within the org.  I would love to get your thoughts about politically and practically how to address these.  
  
CEO REQUESTS - Jason shot me a 15 point email of issues that need to be addressed, and he feels I should somehow facilitate motion on them.  
  
DELIVERABLES - I have an evolving list of “deliverables” that seem indicated.  I have the luxury and curse of a pretty open-ended mandate here, so I need tell SV what I will be delivering and when.  
  
STRATEGY - Big picture, I want to level up my own leadership and the execution of this company though our coaching relationship.    
- It seems we should go into each of these areas as deep as needed in order to be able to assess and correct my approach to them.  
- I want guidance when I should be thinking differently, or “bigger” about these tactical issues.  
- And I want help with the white space, with identifying blind spots where I am not attending to critical “other” issues I am not mentioning.  
- Finally, I feel ok about my quick reaction approaches to the many tactical things I am seeing, but I would love the eyes of one who has been there and done that, over and over in many different orgs, to give me wisdom about these things I am attempting.  
  
  
  
My person-info-management-foo is pretty advanced, so we will be able to view and dive into each of these trees of info at both high and low levels in real time.  This will allow us to cover all of those areas in a brief period.  
  
  
Just to dot the I’s and cross the T’s, do you happen to have an NDA that you could sign with me personally?  Not strictly necessary, but it could make our conversation a bit easier.  If not, I probably have one, and we can avoid the need for it for now if that is better.  
  
Cheers,   
Dan
### m2023-01-24  Context Call








POLITICAL CONTEXT
- PERSONAL GOALS MOSTLY SATISFIED
	- I want to grow my 'hands on' technical strength some.
	- I am an pinch-hitter, ideas-guy more than a line management steward by skill, proclivity and desire.
	- Have most of the equity, cash and title that I will get already.
	- Is going to take skill, finesse to get report to structure anyway.  and may well bruise egos to do it.
	- STILL:
	- I would like practice with smooth running push to production role, instead of the R&D prototyping of my past.
	- More important, I have few critical goals on my plate prior to the A-round.
	- Less impactful for our immediate success.  Issue for delivering value, AND for company success.
- SO MAYBE
	- Mike, Key leader, is very chill, does not seem at all grabby--quasi-retired before this.  and naturally keeps to the R&D CV side of software.
	- Brian, key leader, on non-AI software side is just too junior to lead beyond his current scope.
	- SO MAYBE:  I can build trust with both and using very close relation with Jason to drive high-level objectives of both w/o managing them.
	- OR MAYBE:  Driving those objectives over time, I become defacto manager for them, and later become the actual manager.
	- OR MAYBE:  We hire an in the weeds VP of Eng that reports to me, and he over sees all of SW with them reporting somewhere...
	- MY PLAN:  Build strong alliances with both.  Focus on fomenting action on ground thru consensus & personal sweat for now, and see what happen over time.
	  ==> TRICKY PART:  person sweat can easily feel like I am usurping their authority especially as it will involve direct their reports (with their consent).
