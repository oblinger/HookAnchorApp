## 2025-12-02  Pause Call

- Very serious about Fractional - Want to treat this opportunity w/ care, but my situation is complex
- Strong 15-friendship - need to do what is best for my career, but also need to mange outcomes for SportsVisio.
- Spoke w/ Jason about this opportunity - he asked me to hold off until our A-round (Q2)

Here is the way I am thinking about SportsVisio and Fractional.
- Fractional is pretty magical in the sense that I would quickly get direct and indirect hands of experience w/ wide range of latest AI tech.
- AT SportsVisio I have a founders chunk of equity a good role.  
  BUT less day to day direct hands on exposure to latest AI
  AND there are real risks on the A-round


I have told Jason that I do not want to stick around for some Zombie corporation situation (which would happen by end of Q2)
AND told him I want much more hands on work.

## 2025-11-07  Intro Email

Hi Dan,

  

I’m supporting the search for Staff/Principal engineers to join the early team at Fractional AI. Our founders have built billion-dollar tech companies multiple times and we have incredible velocity:

- From 0 to $12+ million revenue run rate in our first 18 months
- We reached profitability in Q2, have been cash positive since, and should hit $16+ million revenue run rate in 2025
- Partnerships with companies like OpenAI to help their enterprise customers build AI automation ([here's a cookbook we co-authored with OpenAI](https://znsrc.com/c/yoaxpvvvyu))
- Just opened an office in NYC and opening one in Dubai soon!

  

We build custom AI products to help companies like Zapier, [Change.org](http://change.org/), and Airbyte automate processes that were previously impossible to automate (you can check out some of our[projects here](https://znsrc.com/c/fshoomxgmi)). 

  

If you’re excited about building with LLMs and working on critical initiatives for established companies (no maintenance, no exploratory AI POCs), I’d love to talk. 

  

Let me know if you’re open to a 20 minute intro call.

  

Cheers,

Will
