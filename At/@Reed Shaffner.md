## 2025-11-21  Call Summary

Had a great call with Read from TeamSnap!  Here's a quick recap:

It seems we were both pretty open about where our team is at and what our team's aspirations are. They have about 8 to 10 MIT undergrad engineers working for them. But none of them are computer vision specialists, but they're capable of downloading any off-the-shelf models, and trying them out internally, which is the kind of thing that they've done to date. Long-term, it's clear that Read is at least considering building this competency internally. Still, for the short run, that's not as planned at all. Indeed, he talked about, perhaps even having a marketplace where his customers could choose which data partner provided stats, analytics highlights, and other analyses for the games.

In all cases, he imagines exposing that data inside his app and his ecosystem. He mentioned 12 labs as a place they are already working with for getting stats or something on the game. It wasn't clear to me that this was in production; it kind of seemed like pilot work. He mentioned Q2 of next year as the natural moment to pilot something with them to provide data to their customers. He was interested in gaining access to our jobs API right now to see what the interface would look like. But he and I already spoke about that, interfacing and what we're developing is entirely consistent with what they need. I think wanting to look at the API docs is just one of the ways he's testing whether we're real or not. The good news is that Juan has put in solid hours on building strong API docs. I can tell that the make-or-break for us having a relationship with TeamSnap is going to come down to price and accuracy. And I'm pretty sure we're gonna be competing directly with two or three other companies on these measures alone. He also talked about providing AI-generated stats alongside manual stats through his platform. I pushed him on what percentage of his customers he thought might actually want the more expensive $34/game stats. He was bullish on this being a notable part of his customer base. But I don't think he has any real data to support that, I think he's just thinking that these high-end AAU leagues and such are spending so much money per parent that getting this premium service would be of interest. I believe our own experience does cast some doubt on that, but I don't really have a good feel for his customer base, so who knows, maybe that is right.

Anyway, I think the pathway for us is clear here: we want a unified AI-only API and an AI-plus-manual API that serve up game metadata. Between now and Q2, we want to stay connected with his team to make sure that as we're developing all of this, it's aligned with their needs, and then an appropriate point they can test what they get from us and if we clear the bar, then we're at least one of the clients they work with the vendors they work with to get this data.

The immediate next step is providing our API documentation in any discussion that generates. I floated the idea of creating a Slack channel now, with leaders and developers from both teams. He was open to that idea, but it might be premature. I think once we discuss the API, the channel will probably die down. Still, it might be beneficial to have the channel during this period, I'm not sure.  I will CC you @sean and @jason when I share API docs.

## 2025-11-07  Context from Sean

Dan some background here on TeamSnap and Reed.
Do you have your meeting scheduled with him yet?
They have bundled streaming into their new platform which aims to simplify the stack for parents.
We'd fit in here nicely - so need to keep the converation moving along.
