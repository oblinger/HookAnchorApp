Emily,  
  
Thanks for taking the time to chat last week. At the end of our call you mentioned sending a list of VC firms that I might productively connect with. Please so send that list, and I look forward to connecting again in the future.  
  
Cheers,   
Dan

Subj: Technology Focused Venture Capital

Hi Emily,
I am a serial entrepreneur in the midst of selling my current company and quietly exploring a transition into venture capital.  I recently have spoken with Prime Move Labs and other VCs about how I might take my experience founding/exiting companies, leading.  I recently spoke with Prime Movers Labs and other VCs about how my experience might provide value directly for VC firms or their portfolio companies.  (I have a PhD in Computer Science (Machine Learning); found/exit 3 companies and secured and managed over $200M in R&D as a PM at DARPA.)

Aniket Kumar at Software Growth Partners spoke highly of you and your focus on placement within technology focused firms.  I believe a 10-15 minute chat could help me better understand the industry as well as provide guidance towards most relevant people and areas given my background.  Let me know your interest and availability.

Best, 
Dan

P.S.  Through a collaboration I have an interest & understanding in blockchain, perhaps in a later conversation we might talk about directions for Web3

Aniket spoke highly

Your firm and background is in place into technical VC/PE firms so it seems you are likely knowledge

I am considering a move into the investor side fo the fence

Would like to pick your brain about that path, and steps I might take.
