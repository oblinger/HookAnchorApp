### t2022-12-19  Summary of email for Nick.


Nick here are my updates.  Jason continues to be an enigma, after two weeks of radio silence he sent me the email claiming to just be very busy.  He said he thought it was a good idea to get me signed before end of year, but it seems that is not likely.  I dropped my salary offer modestly by $20K to $180K plus 15% equity capped at $12M.  I made my argument that it did not make any sense to drop my equity, when I dropped my salary.  (I would drop my salary even further before the A-round... maybe near or at zero even.  but he is not asking for this, so I think it just looks desperate to be offering)

When I made my case that I could still command $700K in a FAANG he pushed back, but then said, oh yeah I see... so I feel he at least does not have any counter evidence even if he does not fully buy it.
I did not respond to him for 2 weeks and he finally wrote:

Just wanted to shoot you a note to say hi and see how things are going!
I’m still working on the offer stuff on my end, have the document in place but need to update with some stuff. But I’m swamped as I’m getting involved in more of the technical project leadership (you would be better suited here!!!) and preparing for our first BoD meeting on Monday.
Other random good news, Grzegorz took the offer I gave him! He does seem awesome, I’m excited to get him on board.
~

We then had a random conversation the next day about bay area housing, and moving out of here (which would help my burn rate)

It seems he is still thinking about me.  I really dont know what he is thinking... seems I should not be looking desperate here, so I am just waiting to see....  but I think it is better to join sooner than later.



~~

Jake was bullish when I spoke with him.  I feel I could have done better in being enthusiasitc.  Still he offered to intro me to Chris.  I sent a second email to Jake CC to Chris telling them they needed to move fast on GRZ, this morning I sent a one liner to Jake just saying FYI, chris has not responded.

At this point I plan to sit pat and not say anything to either group until after christmas, and probably not until after new year.  For reference here are the notes I sent to Jake/Chris... I am interested if you see ways I could have been better, and / or if you have thoughts about what I do going forward.

(if you would have used a different tone, or said other things, I am very interested.... still don't spend much time on this.)

Cheers, 
Dan

**Subject:** Great chatting today

Jake,  
It was great to chat today.  Please do connect me with Chris, I would love to understand his vision for Sunnova and how I might fit in.  
  
I looked into the Inflation Reduction Act, and now understand the urgency around the consumer monitoring and customer quoting apps in particular.  Those IRA dollars are going to get spent, and  these both have the potential to move the needle on gaining market share during this period of brisk solar adoption. This puts a premium on fast actions that will deploy in 2023 with enough room to make a big difference in the market place.  This really means hiring folks that are going to be capable of delivering right as they enter the organization.  I am also happy to hear that Sunnova is already thinking about AI applications as a differentiator for the business.  After I have signed an NDA, I would love to dig in further to the current thinking in along those lines.  
  
Talk soon,  
Dan

Thank you, Dan.

Dan, Chris is CIO of Sunnova and looking at how to scale our engineering organization.

Chris, Dan is an engineering leader who is interested in Sunnova’s work. He comes from Analytics Fire and is evaluating his next steps.

Hopefully, you two can find time to connect in the next week or so.

Chris,

  

Good to electronically meet.  Jake has given me just a bit of context regarding this moment in time at Sunnova: a large jump in headcount, an opportunity to grow marketshare based on IRA monies, and a mandate to differentiate the product offering thru best-in-market software and AI.  Sounds exciting.

At your convenience I would enjoy hearing your vision for the organization going forward with an eye towards value that I might bring to that picture.

Best,
Dan

Jake,

Independent of my personal discussions with Sunnova, I am happy to help gather relevant information regarding those from Analytics Fire that are now available for hire.  I want to highlight one case in particular since I think it is both important and time sensitive:  Grzegorz Biziel was the most critical employee in developing an automated solar quoting service and he is now in later stage discussions with a non-solar company.  In discussions with him, I can tell that landing Grzegorz is going to be very difficult, still I think it is a large loss to not try, particularly if such specialized expertise is relevant for Sunnova.

A second case is Joremy Buquiran.  His expertise is not as specialized, still he led and executed QA over multiple systems that seem quite relevant to Sunnova’s business.

I have worked for years with most of the Analytics Fire team, so helping them land great new jobs is of benefit all the way around.  Please reach out if I can provide additional information or help in some way.

—Dan

### m2022-12-12  First Call; Tell me about 150 person headcount


Jake, 
Was great to chat today.  Please do connect me with Chris, I would love to chat with him to understand how he sees the outstanding requirements.

I looked into the Inflation Reduction Act, and I now understand the urgency around the consumer monitoring app in particular.  Those IRA dollars are going to get spent, and  the monitoring app is a significant point of potential differentiation for Sunnova.  This puts a large premium on fast action to make changes that will land in 2023 with enough room to make a big difference in the market place.  This really means hiring folks that are going to be capable of delivering right as they enter the organization.  I am also happy to hear that Sunnova is already thinking about AI applications as a capability differentiator for the business.  After I have signed an NDA, I would love to dig in further to the current thinking in along those lines.

Talk again soon, 
Dan





As we get a little further down the road, I would love to sign an NDA in order to understand which items on the current roadmap are most likely to make a difference in purchasing, and how those capabilities line up with our current staffing, as well as doing some brainstorming about AI/ML related capabilities that could be transformative for the business.  I think the uncertainty in financial markets makes this a very good time to be shopping for top Dev talent.

QUESTIONS ABOUT JAKE
- **2023 GOALS** - What are your top 2 overall goals for 2023?    ==> Must find to goals I can help with
- **OTHER/NEXT** - if you weren't at Sunnova now, or decided to leave next week, what would you be doing?


**ABOUT JAKE** - SECONDARY QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED 
- **MANDATE** - What is your mandate at Sunnova?
- **HEADCOUNT** - What resources (headcount & timeframe) have you been given to achieve it?
- **GOALS/NEEDS** - What do you most need?  What are the key goals you have identified?

**ABOUT ME** - SECONDARY QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED 
- **MANDATE** - My mandate @ Sunnova?
- **MY FIT** - How would I fit into your mandate?
	- Would I report directly to you?
	- My expected report-to structure?

	- Would my headcount come entirely from within your budget, or are we aiming to add more?





Nick, Joe:

Jason has given an offer to Greg and not said anything to me.  Maybe I am driving too hard a bargain (15% even if capped)  still he is not pushing back or countering.
Maybe he has just decided he can go without a CTO for now.

Jake is an SVP at Sunnova and has authorization for 150 headcount, and likes Nick and Dan for some executive roles, and as many former Analytics Fire folks as he can get.
I plan to talk to Jake at 10am on Monday about this.  On the one hand, a Sunnova job is really getting farther away from my expertise, on the other hand this could be a VP role which could be additive for me, AND the job market sucks so it is good to simply get offers!

My idea is to come in "blazing" a little bit in this first meeting.  Position myself as a senior guy who is rapidly assessing if this is a synergistic opportunity for us.
My secondary aim, is to frame myself as his minion.  He is an empire builder, so I think viewing me as a subservient empire builder is a value add from his perspective.

Here are the questions from top of my head, that I will focus on.  Happy for any thoughts about how to frame the conversation, or other ideas:

QUESTIONS ABOUT JAKE
- What is your mandate at Sunnova?
- What resources (headcount & timeframe) have you been given to achieve it?
- What do you most need?  What are the key goals you have identified?

QUSETIONS ABOUT ME
- My mandate @ Sunnova?
- How would I fit into your mandate?
- Would I report directly to you?
- My expected report-to structure?
- Would you alone be the person authorizing my hiring?
- Would my headcount come entirely from within your budget, or are we aiming to add more?


Suggested questions:

**"What are your top 2 overall goals for 2023?"**
-   Then double click on things (what would be the impact of accomplishing that? how would success be measured? what's the challenge? how do you think you'll accomplish it? etc) until you find something that can connect w/ AI
-   Better to find out what he really cares about & then use your imagination to figure out how to connect that back to what you do (than to only ask him "how would you use AI?" & then lock onto something that is a match for your skills but low on his actual priority list)
-   This is just another version of your questions. But I have found this wording to be helpful

**"What are your top 2 overall goals for 2023?"**
-   look for opportunities to highlight & reinforce value in your personal relationship beyond Sunnova
-   also, people enjoy talking about themselves & he will walk away from the call liking you more if you you get him to do that



### t2022-12-07  Reconnect email


Jake, 

It is great to reconnect.  I am excited to hear your vision for these new teams at Sunnova, and interested to learn if there is something I can do to support in some way. My schedule is often open in the morning hours PST time, if you have some availability in the coming days I would love to hear what you are thinking about.

Cheers, 
Dan
