Hi Dan,

If I were advising you (only based on seeing your LinkedIn), I would start with a corporate advisory board. Then leverage that for a corporate board (fiduciary) role after that. You don't have board experience so this is a great way to start.

  

Here are 2 people that I helped: in the last 2 months:

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-flynn-b1503a6/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-flynn-b1503a6/)

  

Everyone I work with is different Dan, so your board opportunity will be unique to you.

Want to talk? I feel like the message is hard to get across over email.

  

Here is a snippet of an interview I recently did: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/naomikent_you-are-who-chatgpt-says-you-are-frank-activity-7388545031931977728-hYhg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAphUsBisiq5xwxh6TzBUt9n05W612CJY8](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/naomikent_you-are-who-chatgpt-says-you-are-frank-activity-7388545031931977728-hYhg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAphUsBisiq5xwxh6TzBUt9n05W612CJY8)

Naomi, you can get a strong picture of my background from my linked in.  
As a starting point, you can show me an existing placement you have done that you think matches (roughly) my experience that would be a good starting point.  
  
Best,  
Dan
