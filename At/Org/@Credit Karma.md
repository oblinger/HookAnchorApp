### 2024-11-26  getting transaction log

This is my third attempted chat.  My goal is to get a list of all transactions from all my credit cards.  This was a capability that I had as a Mint.com user, and I was told as I migrated to Mint.com that I could do this here as well.

How do I do this?  The assistant that helped me in the first chat told me that I needed to talk with another group but they were only accessed via email.  But then somehow they did not provide that email address.

Can you tell me how to do this, or supply an email contact for someone who can tell me?
Thanks, Dan
