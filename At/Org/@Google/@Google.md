Hello Jason & Daniel,

Hope you are doing well.

I am reaching out from Google’s business development team, to see if we can introduce our Google Cloud Platform in your business. 

This link [https://googlecloudcheatsheet.withgoogle.com/](https://googlecloudcheatsheet.withgoogle.com/) contains all the GCP products where Google is providing free credits up-to $200,000. 

Lets connect for an introductory call and I will walk you through the entire program and see how these credits bring value to your business. You can schedule a meeting using the  [Appointment Scheduler](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ1X-wS40urHaaLz6c9nU4KeAX2lfvfJNccmwPS9aEzqKNbs9iyKvzuY4zB29IuIZCheeDcIW2Gp) in my calendar based on your availability.

Looking forward to this partnership.

Regards

Harry, thanks for the good info here!  A couple of questions:

1. My understanding is that the CUD discounts are orthogonal to other choices; this is simply a way to obtain cheaper credits.  Is this correct?
2. My understanding is that Google will make a thumbs-up or thumbs-down decision about whether it can honor a reservation request, something like 56 days before the date of the request itself. Is this correct?
3. It sounds like our best bet for having reliable GPU access over the weekend, will be to do reservations well in advance using the on-demand reservation system. Do you think this is the most reliable way to ensure that we will have GPU access when we need it other than permanently allocating GPUs?  Is my understanding correct, is this second best only to permanent allocation?  
4. VERY IMPORTANT:  Assuming this is the best, what is the historical reliability of this method? 
   Specifically, if we are committing to a specific workload more than 2 months before our usage date, how often in the past has Google been unable to accommodate these requests?  I know we can't have any guarantees here, but I need to be able to go back to my team with some data that indicates that this could be a reliable method for us. In the end, we are going to be signing a contract with a customer where we are promising that this data will always be delivered in a timely fashion. I need some kind of data to back up a choice of using Google in this way.
5. I agree with your idea of using flex mode to cover unanticipated or surge requirements as needed. Hopefully this will work most of the time.
