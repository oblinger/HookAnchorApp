Thanks so much for catching me on the street yesterday!!  (I loved your flock of Blackbirds at the house, but didn't see you there)

I am enjoying being the CTO computer vision startup and we just got a new round of funding so there is no urgency to make a move.
Still I can see the writing on the wall...  with the advent of large language models and generative AI, the future of AI is centered on the Big Corps that can afford to play that game.

I would like to start learning about the landscape inside Google where I might best fit, and also get an assessment about how I might best position myself for L7/L8 jobs that leverage my leadership background in: AI/ML/Computer-Vision, and Startup-Prototyping.

Perhaps we could grab a quick coffee on Cortland some afternoon/evening in the next weeks, so I could get a bit of advice?
