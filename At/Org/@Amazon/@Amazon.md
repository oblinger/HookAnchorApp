GETTING HIRED AT AMAZON

- DanO best as Software Manager Role
	- Could be an AS, but higher levels endup more like a SDE (software developer)
	- Could be a SDE, but probably add more value as mgr, and probably like it more too.  (but lots of meetings)
	- Expected to understand deep learning algs, but not expected to be able to code tensor flow models.  (should get coursera training anyway)

- Leveling Comparison.
	- Theo is presently an L5; could become an L6 in right context
	- Grzegorz would probably come in as an L6 SDE

- L7 Expectations:  $500-700 total comp; 25-50people in report to; e.g. 2 regular managers + 3-4 direct reports; Scope of one or multiple products

- Getting Hired
	- Leadership principles - able to answer questions based on them
	- Role Guidelines - each role has its guidelines (they are internal, but likely on the web somewhere)
