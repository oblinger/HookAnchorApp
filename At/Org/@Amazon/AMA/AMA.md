### 2023-01-06  Fake Taylor's Tea

not fake

I received what appears to be fake Taylors Of Harrogate tea that was sold and shipped by Amazon.  Of course Amazon is not going to knowingly sell counterfeit items, still something weird has happened here.  This matters a lot, I am very careful with any food items since counterfit items can easily have toxins or other serious issues, so I want to get to the bottom of what has happened here.  I have photos of what I received I would like to send them in order to begin this investigation.  Here is a summary of the details:


- Taylors of Harrogate have very distinctive wrapping for their tea bags, and (to my knowledge) ALL of their tea bags are shipped in individually wrapped covering envelopes with their logo on it.
- As you will see from the pictures I am sending the box I received is indeed a Taylors of Harrogate box
