We are pretty tidy, and have a Roomba used for daily cleanings.
Still there is value in having someone come monthly for 2-3 hours.
Our schedule is pretty flexible, we could arrange our cleanings to fit with other jobs you have nearby in city.

What would your ongoing cost per month be for one person to come to the hours for 2 hours once a month?  
what would the cost be for 3 hours once a month?

Thanks,
Dan

Just so I understand for the future.... your pricing is by part of the house.  So the $155 is something like this?
2bath + 3bed + Kitchen + Living = $155
$28x$28(baths)  + $18+$18+$18(beds) + $28(Kitchen) + $17(living) = $155
Then if I did part of the house I would pay part of the price, right?  (But obviously it cannot be too small a part of the house!)

$28(bath) + $18(bed) + $28(kitchen) + $17(living) =
