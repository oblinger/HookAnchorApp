Hey Denice, this is Dan, we met at my house next to Jim and Lauren Morales (101 Bache Street).  You said that you would be interested in doing our two bathrooms for $60 when you come to their house.  When is your next visit, maybe we can do it then?

### 2024-07-25  Ask on Thumbtack

Hello!  We are looking for someone to clean our home, ideally on a monthly or every 6 week basis.  We have 3 bedrooms (only two are used) and two bathrooms (only one is used).  We have a robotic mop/vac that runs each day, so it is mostly the other stuff around the house that needs attention.  What is your price for the place, and what is your hourly rate per person?  thanks, Dan
