Hello!  We are looking for someone to clean our home, ideally on a monthly or every 6 week basis.  We have 3 bedrooms (only two are used) and two bathrooms (only one is used).  We have a robotic mop/vac that runs each day, so it is mostly the other stuff around the house that needs attention.  What is your price for the place, and what is your hourly rate per person?  thanks, Dan
