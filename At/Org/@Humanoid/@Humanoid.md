A few comments about my overlap w/ the role:
- Hired a team of 40+ world-class PhD specialists in 9 months using a scaled recruitment team that interacted with and interviewed over 2000 candidates.
- Surveyed the world's best talent in robotic grasping, sourced and landed a $2M engagement with U Vienna for their grasping work.
- Presently working daily with our Computer Vision team on a range of state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer-based technologies for complex, cluttered, dynamic scene understanding.
- Oversaw a semantic that used a combination of RRT planning and Receding Horizon Control with a generalized cost function that allowed us to inject semantic priorities into our motion planning.
- My personal differentiation is my ability to maintain team velocity and focus on a scaled, rapidly evolving R&D productization effort. I thrive in fast-moving environments that require me to be both very high-level and very technically involved.
