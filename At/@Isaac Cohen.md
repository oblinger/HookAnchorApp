### 2023-07-07  Wow, quite a plane ride

Wow, I guess you did a lot of thinking on that plane ride!  Is this a paid intern that is already working with Many Mangos or is this someone you have been talking with before?  She does seems like a pretty solid intern!  Is she based in SF area for the summer?

I have a fair bit of content at this point, a white paper, and other content that is more focused on working out details on how the actual mechanics of the organizations would evolve over time at a practical level.  There is plenty of stuff that I plan to put onto a website...  and would love the help in packaging it in the most accessible way possible.  This is definitely been a labor of love over some years of working it out years!  

I am not against having for profit parts connected to this whole thing, I suspect the right mixture will be a combination of both.  Still I want to take care how it all rolls out.

But most of all, I think the idea is still pie-in-the sky until we have a scalable business cases that really fits the model.  I am not sure if surveys will bring that kind of data in... I have a feeling it is going to be some focused analysis on a couple of cases.  

You mentioned your bee keeping as just one possibility, it would be great to understand more about that.  How much land is available for free from the gov, what is the upfront costs, and the typical P&L cash flow for such a business.

And do you already have bee-keeping operations that you have helped set up?  We should set up a follow up call!

Hehe, I will have to remember that!  Yes, stepwise the way to go, but I am not trying to quench the enthusiasm of your first note, over time I think we could end up doing something big!

As a first step I think figuring out a business that can really works and really scales is HARD.... really HARD.  And either for-profit or not-for-profit I think working on this problem and sharing in the results could be that baby step we could get behind.

I am certainly down with having that follow on call as soon as your back and supporting some analysis from my side as well.

Happy Holiday!








that it is a goal that we can both get behind.  Perhaps that 




But I think it is a goal that we can both get behind.  You are in the business 

, and .  You are in the business of finding new businesses and setting them up around the world.  And a practical understanding of just that goal is really my main gap.  

in Africa, and I think my biggest gap in understanding, is a real understanding of 


, getting down to the concrete details of a viable business AND being connected w/ someone in country would be jet fuel.... smooth is fast.

so where are you and the lady going?




if we could get the concrete details for 




### 2023-05-11  Unsent

by the way.... independent of all of the excitement between MM and SportsVisio it would be enjoyable some time to chat with you regarding an education-related non-profit designed to serve communities that I believe you care about.  I have spent notable time researching it, but have yet to have the time or expertise to launch it  (indeed the idea has an unmet gap which in the end might make the whole thing non-functional... still I bet you would find it interesting, and you might even have pointers for me.).  Not that I have time for such things right now...  I barely have time to sleep. :-).    I just thought about it, as it seemed quite coincident with your mission --- at least what little I really know about your personal mission.
