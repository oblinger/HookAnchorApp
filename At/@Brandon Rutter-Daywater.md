200+ PhDs in academic settings and over 50+ PhDs in commercial settings.





Brandon is a strong lateral thinker.  At both DARPA and Aeolus, I was surrounded by strong minds, and Brandon is among them.  But what makes Brandon stand out within this group (beyond the energy he brings) is his penchant for looking at problems from an angle no one else is considering.  

I recall a session with our hardware team where the latest prototype build was being discussed. They showed how the design was dynamically stable while executing motion plans with its arm fully extended.  Brandon raised the issue that our collision avoidance routines could issue an emergency stop during this operation. Sure enough, calculations showed such a rapid stop could flip the bot on its side, potentially harming the bot or worse, the Elder patients they were designed to assist.

This out-of-the-box thinking feels quite central for this fellowship, so without reservation, I recommend Brandon for the fellowship program.



Brandon is a fast start.  I easily remember a half dozen "mysterious failure" cases where, half a day into it, it would be Brandon slacking the team:  "issue found: race condition between asynchronous planning and PID control parameter updates."  followed by a sketch of a plan on how we might fix it.

Indeed, of the 40+ STRONG PhDs I hired, I made Brandon the lead of the "Robot I/O" team because he had the broadest view of the entire system, as well as his innate high tempo in identifying and attacking the next hurdle.  That "lead the charge from the front" attitude is infectious; it drives Brandon's velocity and the whole team's velocity as well.



Brandon is a good Machine Learning hacker--quickly digging in to understand why the algorithm is doing what it is doing, and having an idea about how to tweak things to improve performance.
