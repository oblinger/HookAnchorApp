Well, Popp, as you can see from the link here the creators of this post, are using AI to generate doom and gloom, financial reports, probably in order to earn a little bit of money from Google ads. Or it could even be a hedge fund, trying to move the markets around, who knows.

Still, in this case, I think there is a grain of truth in the story that they're telling. I just checked and it does seem that billionaires are selling off a fraction of their net worth to get into cash. It's still a small portion of their full cash, their full position, but still it's more cash on hand than we've had in a long long time.

It's tricky to read the signals. At the beginning of the pandemic, I knew that markets were overvalued, and I saw very early in the pandemic that it was gonna shut business down, and this was gonna cost a lot. And there was discussion of whether or not, we would have a V-shaped recovery which means quick, or a U-shaped recovery, which means really slow. I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for us to have a V shaped recovery, because I saw that the things happening in business we're gonna take well more than a year to go through and to rebound out quite possibly multiple years.

So even though, I was smart to see all of these things, I was completely wrong. It turns out that under Obama, the government learned that it could spend money. (quantitative easing.) and stop a massive recession in progress, and do this without spiking inflation, and also in getting their money paid back!

This is a really dangerous lesson to learn, because now Congress learned, and the president learned that they can quantitate use quantitative, easing anytime things get tough. And so at the beginning of Covid, we bailed ourselves out by quantitative, easing the holy crap out of everything. And it worked the economy bounced straight back up. It was a V-shaped recovery. This cost me some money since I was expecting things to really stay terrible for a long time. So even if you get a lot of things right, it's very easy to still be wrong.

Things are really much worse now, inflation really is beating at our door, all the playing around with tariffs that we've done, have made businesses very sheepish about spending money and very uncertain about the future. This is very bad for economic growth, and the ratio that worried me at the beginning of the pandemic of how expensive stocks are versus how much money they generate is just as bad or probably a little worse than it was back then, so we're definitely due for a nice strong recession. The thing is, this time we can't just use quantitative easing like we have in the past quantitative easing drives up inflation, this is a safe thing to do for a short period of time when inflation is low, but it really won't work when inflation is like it is now. And the fed is already said hey if the recession comes, we can't fail your ass out!  Trying to warn the markets that this is a real possibility.

So things are definitely risky. But as soon as Trump started his nonsense with tariffs. (I am not a fan) I was already worried about the recession, and so I got myself significantly into cash. This has not been terrible, but it's also not been the best thing since the markets have really define the odds and have continued going up even during this period of uncertainty. So it's damn tricky to guess this stuff!

But there's no question that we're due for one hell of a recession. It's just far from clear if it's one month or five years away.  But clearly, the billionaires are at least a bit worried....
