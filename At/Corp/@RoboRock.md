  Key Information from the Sources:

  Internal Dock Filter Access:
  1. Remove the dirt bag from the dock first
  2. Remove the filter cover
  3. The internal filter can then be accessed and cleaned
  4. Wipe down to remove debris, ensure completely dry before reinstalling

  Air Pathway Cleaning:
  - The air duct is accessed from the underside of the dock
  - You need to remove: water tanks, dirt bag, water filter, and dock base plate
  - Flip the entire dock over
  - Remove three screws to access the air duct cover
  - Clear blockages and wipe clean

  Dustbin Cover Location:
  - The "dustbin cover" refers to the cover on the robot's dustbin (not the dock)
  - There should be a plastic plate covering the air inlet next to the auto-empty dustbin that needs to be removed

  Unfortunately, I couldn't find specific YouTube videos for the S8 Pro Ultra dock maintenance, but the official Roborock support articles contain detailed step-by-step
  instructions with diagrams that should help you identify the correct components and pathways.
