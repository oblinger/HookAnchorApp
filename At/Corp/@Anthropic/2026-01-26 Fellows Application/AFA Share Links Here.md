**Please briefly describe your role and contributions for each sample.**

Was the initial developer and architect for a CV/robotic platform that grew to have 60 developers. The entire system is proprietary property of Aeolus Robotics.
Active developer of many novel CV algorithms at SportsVisio -- all proprietary except DAT an elegant but small data management layer we open sourced:

DVC DAT - It provides flexible namespace management that integrates dynamically loaded code with cloud datasets, ensuring versioning is synchronized across them and your code repository.  

ALIEN BIOLOGY - Framework for generating controllable synthetic "Alien" biological ecosystems for use in taint-free testing of Agentic reasoning.
- Parametrically controlled complexity builds worlds with organisms, predation/symbiosis/etc. build on a synthetic biochemistry with molecules, reactions, cycles, pathways, signaling, etc. LLM serves as an alien biologist, advancing biology and curing disease.
- The framework is elegant/general and biologically plausible. (will be completed and could possibly serve as the basis of my fellowship work)

I am a very fast, strong, organized coder, but most of my work is proprietary.  Alien Bio was developed over a compressed period, so it is a good measure of my capacity.


{{NICK:  Over the summer I wrote a 35K line personal knowlege management tool in Rust, Javascript and Swift, it is not open source, but I could share the codebase if it would add value}}
