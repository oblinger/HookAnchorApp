**Please briefly describe your role and contributions for each sample.**

Was the initial developer and architect for a CV/robotic platform that grew to have 60 developers. The entire system is proprietary property of Aeolus Robotics.
Active developer of many novel CV algorithms at SportsVisio -- all proprietary except DAT an elegant but small data management layer we open sourced:

DVC DAT - It provides flexible namespace management that integrates dynamically loaded code with cloud datasets, ensuring versioning is synchronized across them and your code repository.  


Alien Biology - Framework for generating controllable synthetic "Alien" biological ecosystems for use in taint-free testing of Agentic reasoning.
- Parametrically controlled complexity builds worlds with organisms, predation/symbiosis/etc. build on a synthetic biochemistry with molecules, reactions, cycles, pathways, signaling, etc. LLM serves as an alien biologist, discovering biology and curing disease, etc.
- The framework is elegant/general and biologically plausible. (will be completed and could possibly serve as the basis of my fellowship work)

Half a year ago, I wrote a white paper for AlienBiology—a provably Taint-free testbed, since all reasoning problems come from a generated universe with novel, synthetically generated organisms, bioreactions, and molecules.

I think it is a great testbed for studying AI reasoning in a context where one can provably isolate reasoning from any trained priors, since the world is synthetic from the molecules up.  I was reluctant to implement this, as it seemed more useful for advancing AI capabilities than for AI safety.
