Alien Biology - Framework for generating synthetic "Alien" biological ecosystems with alien organisms, with alien molecules, alien bio chemical reactions, pathways

Half a year ago, I wrote a white paper for AlienBiology—a provably Taint-free testbed, since all reasoning problems come from a generated universe with novel, synthetically generated organisms, bioreactions, and molecules.

I think it is a great testbed for studying AI reasoning in a context where one can provably isolate reasoning from any trained priors, since the world is synthetic from the molecules up.  I was reluctant to implement this, as it seemed more useful for advancing AI capabilities than for AI safety.
