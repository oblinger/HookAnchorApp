**How likely are you to accept a full-time offer at Anthropic if you receive one after the Fellows program? ***
- 100%!  More than all other foundational labs, I feel Anthropic is most serious about AI-safety.  It is by far my most effective choice.

**How likely are you to be interested in continuing to work on AI safety after the Fellows program? ***
- 95%.  My goal is to pivot into any safety role focused on existential risk.  So long as the role appears to be a long-term position, I am ready to terminate my current CTO role.
