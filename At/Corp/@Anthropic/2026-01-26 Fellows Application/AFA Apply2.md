[[AFA Share Links Here]]  
**SHARE LINKS HERE:**
**Please share code samples from past projects, ideally a substantial project and (if possible) a machine learning project.**
**Please briefly describe your role and contributions for each sample.**

Was the initial developer and architect for a CV/robotic platform that grew to have 60 developers. The entire system is proprietary property of Aeolus Robotics.
Active developer of many novel CV algorithms at SportsVisio -- all proprietary except DAT an elegant but small data management layer we open sourced:

DVC DAT - It provides flexible namespace management that integrates dynamically loaded code with cloud datasets, ensuring versioning is synchronized across them and your code repository.  

ALIEN BIOLOGY - Framework for generating controllable synthetic "Alien" biological ecosystems for use in taint-free testing of Agentic reasoning.
- Parametrically controlled complexity builds worlds with organisms, predation/symbiosis/etc. build on a synthetic biochemistry with molecules, reactions, cycles, pathways, signaling, etc. LLM serves as an alien biologist, advancing biology and curing disease.
- The framework is elegant/general and biologically plausible. (will be completed and could possibly serve as the basis of my fellowship work)

I am a very fast, strong, organized coder, but most of my work is proprietary.  Alien Bio was developed over a compressed period, so it is a good measure of my capacity.

{{NICK:  Over the summer I wrote a 35K line personal knowlege management tool in Rust, Javascript and Swift, it is not open source, but I could share the codebase if it would add value}}

[[AFA Why Are You Interested]] 
**WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THE AI FELLOWS PROGRAM?   (1-2 paragraphs)**




[[AFA Application Area and Why]]
**PLEASE TELL US BRIEFLY ABOUT AN AREA OF TECHNICAL AI SAFETY WORK YOU’RE CURRENTLY EXCITED ABOUT, AND WHY.   (1 paragraph)**





[[AFA Relevant Background]] 
**(Optional) Please share any relevant AI safety background you have and provide links where possible (e.g., research experience, coursework, self-directed study, past roles, relevant projects).**



**How likely are you to accept a full-time offer at Anthropic if you receive one after the Fellows program? ***
- 100%.  More than all other foundational labs, I feel Anthropic is most serious and open-minded about AI-safety.  This is by far my most effective choice.

**How likely are you to be interested in continuing to work on AI safety after the Fellows program? ***
- 95%.  My goal is to pivot into a safety role focused on existential risk.  As long as the role appears to be a long-term position, I am ready to terminate my current CTO role.

**Do you have any other commitments or obligations during the Fellows program?**
- I will be on an unpaid leave from SportsVisio during this time.  I have made it clear that this means zero hours per week during this time.

**How Did you hear about the Fellows program?**  
- From multiple colleagues.

**Is there anything else you would like to share?**
