## Info
- The deadline is January 12, 2026.
  The program runs in two cohorts (May and July 2026). Fellows get:
  - $3,850/week stipend
  - ~$15k/month compute
  - 4 months of mentorship from Anthropic researchers
  - Workspaces in London and Berkeley (or remote in US/UK/Canada)
  Over 40% of fellows from the first cohort joined Anthropic full-time.

Half a year ago, I wrote a white paper for AlienBiology—a provably Taint-free testbed, since all reasoning problems come from a generated universe with novel, synthetically generated organisms, bioreactions, and molecules.

I think it is a great testbed for studying AI reasoning in a context where one can provably isolate reasoning from any trained priors, since the world is synthetic from the molecules up.  I was reluctant to implement this, as it seemed more useful for advancing AI capabilities than for AI safety.



WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THE AI FELLOWS PROGRAM?   (1-2 paragraphs)



PLEASE TELL US BRIEFLY ABOUT AN AREA OF TECHNICAL AI SAFETY WORK YOU’RE CURRENTLY EXCITED ABOUT, AND WHY.   (1 paragraph)


(Optional) Please share any relevant AI safety background you have and provide links where possible (e.g., research experience, coursework, self-directed study, past roles, relevant projects).



How likely are you to be interested in continuing to work on AI safety after the Fellows program? *
