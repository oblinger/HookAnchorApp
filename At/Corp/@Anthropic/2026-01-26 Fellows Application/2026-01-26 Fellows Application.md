## Andrew Ask

Andrew:

I am not sure if you remember the better part of a day that we spent in 2009 talking about unsupervised methods for learning deep representations.  You were interested, but also frustrated that my ideas seemed too big/vague to make progress on. I responded by driving one of the ideas down into a very narrow approach for inducing deep and-or trees.  You liked it and asked if you could share it with a student for exploration, and ended the day telling me that I should come be a post-doc after DARPA.  Well, perhaps I should have!

I think your students went on to publish: *"Convolutional Deep Belief Networks for Scalable Unsupervised Learning of Hierarchical Representations"*, from that idea, while the general council at DARPA forbade me from participating (at least Honglak acknowledged me in the paper!)

Besides saying "hello" after so many years, the reason I am writing is to ask if you could provide a reference for an AI safety fellowship program at Anthropic.

I recognize we never collaborated on completed work, so if you were contacted, you could only provide the context based on our few deep discussions.  Still, I think that thin slice would still add value.

Let me know.

## Info
- The deadline is January 12, 2026.
  The program runs in two cohorts (May and July 2026). Fellows get:
  - $3,850/week stipend
  - ~$15k/month compute
  - 4 months of mentorship from Anthropic researchers
  - Workspaces in London and Berkeley (or remote in US/UK/Canada)
  Over 40% of fellows from the first cohort joined Anthropic full-time.

Alien Biology - Framework for generating synthetic "Alien" biological ecosystems with alien organisms, with alien molecules, alien bio chemical reactions, pathways

Half a year ago, I wrote a white paper for AlienBiology—a provably Taint-free testbed, since all reasoning problems come from a generated universe with novel, synthetically generated organisms, bioreactions, and molecules.

I think it is a great testbed for studying AI reasoning in a context where one can provably isolate reasoning from any trained priors, since the world is synthetic from the molecules up.  I was reluctant to implement this, as it seemed more useful for advancing AI capabilities than for AI safety.
