Andrew:

I'm not sure if you remember a day in 2009 when we spent discussing unsupervised methods for learning deep representations. You were interested, but skeptical since my ideas seemed too broad or vague to make progress on. I responded by focusing on one of those ideas into a very narrow approach for inducing deep and/or trees. You liked it, and asked if you could share it with a student so we could collaborate on it.  Your student went on to get a best paper award at ICML for "Convolutional Deep Belief Nets," while the general council refused to allow me to collaborate!  At the end of the day's discussion, you told me I should come to be a postdoc after DARPA. Well, maybe I should have!

Tomorrow I am applying for an Anthropic Fellowship in AI safety. Would you be okay if I used this discussion as a reference for that application?

Thanks,
Dan

I am not sure if you remember the better part of a day that we spent in 2009 talking about unsupervised methods for learning deep representations.  You were interested, but also frustrated that my ideas seemed too big/vague to make progress on. I responded by driving one of the ideas down into a very narrow approach for inducing deep and-or trees.  You liked it and asked if you could share it with a student for exploration, and ended the day telling me that I should come be a post-doc after DARPA.  Well, perhaps I should have!  
  
I think your students went on to publish: *"Convolutional Deep Belief Networks for Scalable Unsupervised Learning of Hierarchical Representations"*, from that idea, while the general council at DARPA forbade me from participating (at least Honglak acknowledged me in the paper!)  
  
Besides saying "hello" after so many years, the reason I am writing is to ask if you could provide a reference for an AI safety fellowship program at Anthropic.  
  
I recognize we never collaborated on completed work, so if you were contacted, you could only provide the context based on our few deep discussions.  Still, I think that thin slice would still add value.  
  
Let me know.

1. You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take!
2. But I think there is an inverse relationship between length & chances of him responding. Is it possible to cut the length by at least half?
3. Is it possible to make it easier for him to say yes to? Eg: we met, remember this thing happened, I’m applying for Anthropic, if I use this discussion as a reference would you confirm that?
