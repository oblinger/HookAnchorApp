WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THE AI FELLOWS PROGRAM?   (1-2 paragraphs)

I have long been interested in systems that can bootstrap beyond human intelligence (this was the basis for one of my DARPA programs), and my Machine Reading program also drove early ML + NLP work in that direction.  But it has also left me skeptical that we can keep control of an intelligence that will far outstrip ours.  Leaving DARPA, I consciously chose a more applied AI path because I did not want to be part of that agenda.  Especially since, try as I might, I could not see a real path to enduring safety, given that these systems will be involved in creating an endless succession of successor systems; one slip in the chain is all it takes.

At the beginning of this year, I drafted a white paper, "Alien Biology."  It is a clever way to measure AI reasoning performance that is provably untainted by reasoning in its training data.  I have been reluctant to run with this idea, however, since it seems more valuable in advancing AI reasoning, not AI safety.  Now I see a glimmer of possibility!  When future AI systems use deliberation to achieve internal alignment, I believe they will have instrumental reason to strive to increase that internal alignment within themselves and their progeny.  Perhaps this could afford a natural long-term alignment of their interests with humanity

align their interests with, rather than, at odds with humanity.

I have drafted the very beginnings of this researchlaid out the beginnings of a reserach agenda in this direction and I think it is
