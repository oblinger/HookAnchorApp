Anthropic AI Safety Fellowship - What to Expect

  The Coding Test Structure

  Round 1: CodeSignal Assessment
  - 4-level coding challenge (progressive difficulty)
  - Pure Python - no ML libraries needed
  - OOP-focused: build systems like banking, database, file system
  - Example: In-memory database with SET/GET/DELETE → filtered scans → TTL → compression
  - Target score: 480/600 to advance

  Round 2: Live Coding (55 min)
  - Google Meet, shared Python environment
  - LeetCode medium-level, but more practical than algorithmic
  - Focus on speed and correctness over Big O analysis
  - Modular, clean code matters - requirements evolve during the test

  Round 3: LLM Prompting (55 min)
  - Engineering with LLMs in Colab
  - Prompt engineering, debugging, practical Claude/LLM usage

  Round 4: Research Brainstorm (15 min)
  - With an Anthropic researcher
  - AI safety discussion, your ideas, alignment thinking

  Key Insights

  - No AI assistance allowed in live interviews
  - Python only - be very comfortable with it
  - Use a large monitor - time pressure is real
  - They care about AI safety thinking as much as coding
  - Read their https://www.anthropic.com/core-views-on-ai-safety and interpretability research

  What They're Looking For

  "They care deeply about alignment, safety, and ethics. If you can't talk thoughtfully about AI safety, you're probably not getting the offer."

✻ Baked for 54s

❯ they say I need to take the coding test. By the twenty eighth. Does this mean I need to do the first test by then? And then they'll ask me about the next test. Or do these
  tests happen in quick succession?

⏺ Based on the interview info, the CodeSignal assessment is the first gate. That's likely what they mean by "coding test by the 28th."

  The typical flow:

  1. CodeSignal (online, async) ← This is your Jan 28 deadline
    - You take it on your own time before the deadline
    - ~4 level progressive coding challenge
    - Need ~480/600 to advance
  2. Then they review and schedule next rounds (days/weeks later)
    - Live coding interview (55 min)
    - LLM prompting interview (55 min)
    - Research brainstorm (15 min)

  The process reportedly takes 3-4 weeks total from start to offer, so the live interviews don't happen immediately after CodeSignal.

  Bottom line: Complete the CodeSignal by the 28th. If you pass, they'll reach out to schedule the next rounds - you'll have time to prepare further.

  Want me to help you prep for the CodeSignal format? The OOP/system-building style (database, file system) is specific and worth practicing.
