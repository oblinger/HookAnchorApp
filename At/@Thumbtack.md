It is overly complex and not fair to have three or more technicians come out to provide a quote and then only select one. So, I request an initial estimate based on the assumption that no unforeseen complexity will arise to help determine which pro I will invite for a visit to provide a formal quote.

(1) Israel holds all the cards and will not accept any change that notably lowers their security. (Everyone accepts this)  
(2) A percentage of Palestinians currently want to wipe Israel from the map. No matter what wealth or concessions are given, too much bad blood, too much funding from Iran, and too much of a feeling of lands stolen. For them its nothing less than “river to sea”! (Everyone accepts this)  
(3) Thus today a two state solution cannot work: Palestinians will be oppressed and monitored so thoroughly it is difficult to launch an attack. (Logical consequence of #1 and #2)  
(4) By this logic many argue this forcible control is a necessary evil. Even if true, Israel and Egypt are still guilty of meting out horrendous collective punishment against many innocents Palestinians.
