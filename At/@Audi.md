Royal Automotive Review:

aaaa
General conclusion:  Not good value for the money.

Detailed example:  I knocked the roof fin off my Audi and ask Royal to fix it.  For $650 they gave me a replacement part and painted it.  This seems a reasonable amount.

Then the wanted $2000 to install it.  this is because they insisted to push out a VERY minor depression on the room.  (barely visible)  I said I would like them to install it in a way that is sealed, but I don't need perfect body work as long as it is sealed.  (Honestly even if they did nothing except install the new part I am not certain if you could even see the depression)  They refused to say that pushing the roof out and repainting the roof was needed to seal the roof (since I don't think it IS required), and they refused to simply install it.

I took it to DAS auto and they installed it for $300, and told me it was sealed just fine.  Further when I look at the result on the car, it looks just fine.  If I get my head level with the top of the car and stare right at the front of the fin, I CAN see a tiny bit of a bubble there.  If I did not know what I was looking for, I would never have detected anything.

So Royal was absolutely unwilling to follow my request for an installation that sealed the car.  If you will always pay to keep your car immaculate as if it just left the showroom floor, then this limitation might not matter to you.  But for me I want the ability to decide, and I want a mechanic who will give me the straight scoop on the situation.  In that case Royal Automotive is just not the place for you.

DAS was great, but I get the sense that there are several very highly rated german auto specialists around...  Just pick DAS or one of these others!


These guys are organized around extracting your money.  I bought a late model A4 and paid $10K for four years of protection and service.  It was a poor choice on my part, and not worth it.  Still these guys are typical dealers in that regard.
