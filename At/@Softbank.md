Jason,

Just had a conversation with Sean about our Softbank call tomorrow.
Sean laid out three possible reasons Softbank might have for reaching out:
(1) They actually want to partner as they claim
(2) They are sniffing around to learn something
(3) They are looking at a possible acquisition


Unfortunately I fear it is #2.  As Tony Tether often said "Don't be your miracle on someone else's miracle."  I find it hard to believe they are wanting to partner with an AI company in order to get the same capacity they already have, just at a lower cost.  Reaching out cold for such a dubious advantage seems quite unlikely.  My most optimistic hope is that they are angling for a strategic partnership where they gain an equity stake in SV on the basis of their access to a market.  Possible, but I feel an outfit like Softbank would either not want to mess with us or would want to eat us whole.
Sean plans to start the call just asking them what type of partnerships we might be considering as a way guiding our conversation.  Based on their answers we might lower our guard some.

Still while I am skeptical, I also think we are relatively safe in being somewhat open here.  We won't be digging into which algs/approaches we are taking.  The main info they will gain, is knowledge about what is possible:

My leading guess about what is going on here is that Softbank is considering investing in CV-based basketball, and they want to know that it is possible to do it, before spending the money.  Even if we don't talk with them, they can still look at our product outputs and our pricing and get a basic idea about what is possible.  Unless I REALLY come off as combative, they will likely leave that meeting with additional support for investing in a company that one day could be a direct competitor.  (or maybe they invest in us, but less likely since this company is directly run by Softbank!). My sense is it still make sense to have the call, and to be open with them in a conservative way.  Looking for your guidance on this.

Concretely I plan to talk in generalities about what we can and cannot do.  and in generalities about the quality levels we achieve, but not exact on anything.  So, for example, if they asked if we can do player ID.  I would say yes, but gaining sufficient accuracy in all contexts remains a work in progress. I do want them to see us as desirable and capable, thus I will talk up the difficulty of doing basketball, and toss of half dozen or so specialty modules that we have build as part of our end-to-end solution.  I think naming these (like short origin analysis via multiple approaches) makes us look super cool, and makes the build vs buy equation tip towards BUY.

If they press us about having things in production, my thought is to be optimistic and talk about AI-minutes and annotator halo speedups as being capabilities that we have built.  If they really press on this, i think I would be honest about their current status.

But I am looking for guidance here.  Is this how you want me to play it?  Any other thoughts for me?
