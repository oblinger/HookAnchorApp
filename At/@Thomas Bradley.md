## 2025-10-13  Response to Sean After chat

Sean, yeah, we had a good talk.  Nice kid.
I cannot tell if would be a strong engineer for Taka.io.

- On the plus side, it reall proves he is scrappy to have created hooper and gotten traction.
- And he is clearly interested in sports AI.
- He does not have any formal training beyond a bachelor's degree, nor that many years of being a developer.  This is not so much a negative if one just wants a developer who is taking orders from someone with more experience.
- But I think he wants to be something of a researcher.  He has some ideas he wants to push, but not really the background to push them in a rigorous way.  If he spent too much of his energies trying to follow those ideas it would be distracting from an agenda to deliver fast results for Taka.io.
- Still, his ideas are not dumb, so it is possible, as a longer-term research agenda, that they could yield fruit.  And he is hungry for work, so if he were properly managed, I think one could keep a lid on his desire to dive into an ambitious research agenda (without training).

Below you can see to email asks that a sent to him to provide me with any evidence of effectiveness from his basketball code.  He did not respond to either one, after that I did not follow up.

I think he is not trained to do the work he is messing with, so he probably does not have the results I am asking for, but still that does not mean he would have no value as an engineer for Taka.io.  He seems like a guy with ideas, and with some ability to execute since he built hooper.


Gregorz is the main person I recommend elsewhere, but it might be hard to get him to move.  I have been keeping tabs on him, and he is pretty happy at the consulting firm where he landed.  They pay better than we did, and he is getting to work on a range of CV projects with strong people.  So it will be a tall order for Taka.io to pull him away.  But he would be a solid CV engineer capable of driving a couple of junior folks.  And he would not head off is crazy directions, he would be a solid autonomous performer....  (if they can get him)

I am happy to make an intro if they are serious.




## 2025-10-13  Intro from Sean

- Young scrappy founder from belfast.  
- Built Hooper.AI
-   ``I am deeply interested in sport, physics, and artificial intelligence (particularly in humans).

- I asked:   
Do you happen to have any analysis of the performance of your algorithms?

e. g. false positive rates / false negative rates.  Espeically in a format that is comparable to anything published anywhere?

- Then I asked:
Thomas, that might be a large ask… if you don’t have any formal results, do you have any less formal analysis of the performance of your system?
