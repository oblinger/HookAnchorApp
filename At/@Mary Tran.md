Mary,

I am a serial entrepreneur in the midst of selling my current company.  I am considering a move onto the investor side of the fence.  I spoke with Aniket Kumar about this and he suggested you as a good contact, and as a person I might gain advice and insight regarding this possible move.

Perhaps we can schedule a 30 minute call for connection and advice.

Best, 
Dan Oblinger PhD.
