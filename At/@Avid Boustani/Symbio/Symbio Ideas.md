SCAFFOLD REPRESENTATION:  
- 2D region model (containment, proximity, ...)  
- Temporal model
- Assertion Model (prov)

- Intermediate Representation (DAG Region model - only salient regions listed)
- Hang inference with Provence off the tree
- Collection pipe: doers/cleaners/validators, 


DATA GATHER LOOP: 
- Hire/contract one-senior env engineer.
- Get firehose of concrete cases.
- Get/train junior data wranglers to encode cases at scale.  Use double or AI validation for accuracy.
- Crawl, Walk, Run:  Collect -> Abstract w/ full provenance -> towards Report w/ full validation -> Reports w/ targeted spot checking

[[Symbio Data Completeness]]  

TRICKS
- Waterfall dataflow
- Iterative refinement:  Ask LLM to revise.  and ask to validate.
- Use OCR on images to identify and parse callouts
- Use pre-trained object detector to identify semantic items on drawings
