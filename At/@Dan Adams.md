In fact, it probably wasnt even worth the effort to make fun of me while I was not around.

Adam's especially seem to relish the in your face part of it.... and he had so much good material.


funny thing... here is startup-land Mountain View style, nobody could give two S**ts about DARPA or being a PM.
the question is what have you _DONE_     (giving other people money, just doesn't even rate as 'doing' ...), and
what can you _DO_ right now.... like in the next five minutes, right now...


just plain *rude*   :-)  

but fun .... 


 my CEO co-founder is now market-testing a product I have not built yet... in a language (rails) I don't know yet, on a deployment platform (Amazon EC2) that I have never used before, incorporating dozens of tools/languages/api/payment platforms, etc that I have yet to learn.

30 days till product launch...  and it cannot be flaky, must be online upgradable, since it is primary purpose is a payment processing platform.
12.5 weeks till demo day.... 


So, Danny, what can you do NOW?   
 
I don't believe it is possible to have undergone a more rapid downgrade in authority and status.
(but oddly very satisfying to have everything ride on what you produce w. your own fingers)
