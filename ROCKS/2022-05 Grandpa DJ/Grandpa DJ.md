OJECTIVE:
- Design, build, launch, and iterate a synergistic pair of businesses:  
	- Grandpa DJ Streaming -- An online 
	- Grandpa DJ Event Services -- 

CONTEXT AND CONSTRAINTS:
- We don't know if this business will take off or not, thus 
	- We want to treat this as a series of experiments where Steve tries various branding and marketing strategies to see what works.
	- We want to minimize the initial costs (both time and money) in order to run this experiment.  
	- If it works later we can upgrade many things, for now, we want to do the absolute minimum needed to look for market signal.
- Justin brings a lot to the table here, he is a PERFECT MATCH for this project:
	- He has expert level experience in ALL of the relevant technologies:  website development, payment mechanisms, streaming service setup, etc.
	- He is running businesses that already have WordPress servers and email servers etc., and has offered to provide contribute these initially since there is no incremental cost to him for providing them.  (hooray!)
	- He has also offered to build the word press site and connect it to streaming services, payment buttons, etc.  (hooray!)
	- He has experience marketing and growing multiple consumer facing businesses, so his instincts about what choices to make are likely to very well informed, battle tested wisdom.  He can see how the market is responding and give advice on what to try.
	- He is also connected to the music scene in Florida so he may have various contacts which can be of value to this process.
	- Holy crap!  Really kind of shocking how good the match is!
- Precious resource
	- But because of this it would be all too easy to lean on Justin for everything, and all the time.  For edits, updates, tweaks,  etc.  Making phone calls etc.
	- We have to treat Justin's time as pure gold.  Each hour he spends on this is very precious.  It seems he can add huge value in each sub area, so it will be great if he has the time, to contribute a little in each area.  Still he is running multiple businesses now that take a lot of time.  This will all fall apart if the time load grows.
	- Justin should only work on a thing that are small and quick, and we should be aiming that 100% of ongoing work is done directly by Steve.
	- DanO is not really trained on the practical apps that are needed here, I don't want to operate inefficiently, trying to learn to run some bit of IT that is pretty far from my area of expertise.  If there are ways I am the right specialist I am to help, though my hours are also pretty constrained.  In this effort, I am probably mostly like XXX from Mad Men, the grey beard know-it-all who talks a big game, drinks whiskey, 
	- DaveO is local, and able to support with 'boots on the ground' as needed.  This might be relevant for setting up Steve's studio etc.
- OWNERSHIP AND LIABILITY
	- This is Steve Cresep's baby.  The rest of us are providing services and support on an as is basis with no guarantees and no liability.  Steve is the sole owner of the business, and holds all responsibilities and liabilities associated with it.
	- No Boss Man - No body is really in charge here, we are just coming together to make a go of this idea.  Thus everyone should feed good about adding/editing this document so we have a best plan for execution.  If discussion is needed, please just add comments directly to this 


CRUDE ROADMAP
	Grandpa DJ Streaming (GDS) Business
- GATHER MATERIALS - Steve gathers materials and uploads them to a cloud drive for Justin.
- FINALIZE PLAN - Finalize these documents specifying the exact contents of the website & initial plan for the streaming service.
- STREAMING SETUP - Buy the required hardware for streaming (mics, cameras, and stage setup).
- BUILD - Build website, integrate with streaming, and tip jar.
- LAUNCH - Launch Experiment 1.
- ITERATE - Keep trying different branding, marketing strategies until a robust, growing superfan base is achieved.
- PATH-ONE - If fan-base trajectory looks very strong, then double down on growing and monitizing this stream.
- PATH-TWO - if fan-base trajectory is less than stellar and Steve has bandwidth for a second business, then ramping up a DJ-ing business is done in parallel.
  Grandpa DJ Events (GDE) Business
- (No need to plan further at this point)



EXPERIMENT 1 

UNDERLYING IDEA AND REASONING:
- The streaming business is (1) easier to setup than the event DJ event business, (2) it could easily be viable stand alone business, and (3) even if it is not successful it would provide an ideal marketing brand and channel for driving a subsequent DJ-event business.  For all of these reasons Steve will initially focus solely on the streaming business trying to drive it to be a viable stand alone business.  At some point the second business could be launched in parallel.
- Below we focus our experiment 1 hypothesis on organic viral growth since steve does not have the cash for a sustained marketing based growth path, and at least for now we have no expectation that the his customer lifetime value will be large, nor an expectation that the cost of customer acquisition will be small enough support a marketing driven growth strategy.  Thus we start with a focus on organic viral growth, with various marketing spikes used as initial boosts in the market place.
- Given this reasoning we focus on the viral growth of "super fans" as our key metric of success for this hypothesis success.  (A "super fan" is a fan interacts heavily with the site over some sustained period with evidence of recruiting at least one other super fan, and probably others.
- Our reasoning is that viral grow is primarily driven by the most engaged customers, and once we see that each super fan in bringing in more than one super fan we see that we have viral winner on our hands (notice this measure will not falsely give us credit for fans that we acquire thru non-viral marketing means in our initial boost phase).
- A fully viral business is a marketer's wet dream, and it is freaking hard to achieve.  This strategy may fail, and we have to pivot to a different one.  Still we select it as our starter strategy since it is naturally less capital intensive (less marketing and such), and it has the virtue of focusing Steve's attention on each of his super fans, one-by-one, trying to understand what is driving them to engage, and driving them to recruit.  Even if the pure viral strategy fails, this customer attention on the super fans is the key info he needs in building the best possible brand.

HYPOTHESIS:
Grandpa DJ streaming will become a viable standalone business primarily through ORGANIC VIRAL GROWTH.

METRIC
- SUPER FAN - A super fan is a viewer that consistently engages with the DJ feed (at least 10 times per month), and is responsible bringing one and probably more other super fans to the stream.
- ROBUST SUPER FAN GROWTH - We define robust super fan growth as at least 5-10% month over month growth in the aggregate number of super fans sustained for at least 4 months.  Aggregate super fan count is the absolute number of fans, so new fans minus fan churn.  
- VIABLE STAND ALONE BUSINESS - As a lower bound we set UUUU unique monthly visitors, with a monthly revenue of RRR per thousand visitors as a minimal target for a viable stand alone business.
- COMMENTS:  
	- BLEED ON THIS - Justin I have little boots on the ground experience with growing a business like this.  So you are probably going to look at this section like a kindegardener with crayons wrote it.  That is all good, just edit the whole thing to be a much better target I am positive your instincts on this will be superior to mine in all the details, so just do it!  
	- SUPER CONSERVATIVE - Overall I am trying to aim our metric as low as we can go.  These are NOT intended as targeted, expected, or ideal metrics.  Rather these are intended to be our FAILURE threshold metrics.  e.g. if steven cannot hit at least these super modest numbers, then it is a sign that the current strategy is not going to work, and he needs to try something new.  It might be a new branding or interaction strategy, or maybe we give up on virality or even streaming to focus on Event DJ-ing.  The goal is to set the numbers conservatively so not making the numbers means he need to change course.



BRANDING IDEAS
- Grandpa DJ - The man himself - The slightly rude and crude old timer playing his favorites and kinda crapping on all the other stuff that just does not measure up to the music he knows is the best.
- His face - I think one or two camera angles on your rig while you are DJ-ing will be a very compelling part of your show.  It will let the viewer see that you really are live DJ-ing the music, and communicating with them live.  Ideally you can flip between camera on your setup, a wide view of the room, a view of the video associated with a song, and the stream of messages.  This lets the viewer see you in action.  (not sure if that is easy for Justin or not!)
- His voice -- Having only song video and audio clips on your stream w/o any voice track from you might leave the channel feeling light.  Perhaps you can create dozens and finally hundreds of phrase clippings that you have ready to trigger in reaction to the songs or to viewer comments.  Somehow we get some person with the right scratchy old man voice to record each of these phrases for quick playback.  They would be very repeated on the show, they would be a bit like a meem phrase that are funny since the same phrase is repeatedly used as a way to griping, complementing, or offering commentary.  "not bad considering the lead guitar only seems to know three cords"
  They are funny because they are your trademark phrases.  Best if the voice is a little like your voice, since I think you should definitely chime in verbally with your voice too.  like you use a canned typed or voiced comment, then you grunt or laugh at your own joke.  Maybe a better approach is to use a clearly computer generated voice... that has the advantage that you can easily generate content on the fly, and it is all written and spoken too.  yeah that could be your shtick ... especially if it is a kind of funky robo voice.
- His past - Steve your life and past are unique and colorful.  Many of the stories I know are very connected to being a disabled dude, in a world that doesn't always give a shit, and causes you grief.  I think these little sound bite stories could be a little 2 minute read, that would be funny in some way.  could be a joke on you (which is why you are old and grouchy) or a joke on the system (when you get away with some shit you should not have).  or a feel good story where someone has gone above and beyond to do something cool for you.  (but of course as a grouchy old man you still somehow complain about it... but the viewer also knows you are damn happy about it too.)
          e.g. someone you just met came over a painted your walls, but then you notice the parts around the window frame look like a 3rd grader's school project etc.
          and you end with some back handedly hopeful phrase like, but at least now the theme of my kitchen no longer looks like a 1970s sitcom (or whatever).
	- My idea is to write up these short little stories and you inject them into your show once per episode or once per week.  You have some kind of tagline title for these little stories, so you regular listeners come to expect them, and they are just kind of a funny aside... but they have the added benefit that your audience really gets to see a window into your life after seeing a dozen or so of them.  And by giving it a tagline and regular spot on your show it is not really like you are complaining, or looking for pity, rather this is just an expect segment of the show.  If you have a robo-voice that reads the story off, I think it could be fun, since we know you wrote it... it is coming from you, and at the same time, you can laugh, grunt, or maybe even have two or three canned sound effects in order to express a couple of canned of reactions.
- His vices - I know you steve, you are a foul mouthed horn dog who has spent too many dollars and too many hours in titty bars.  you could easily generate a really colorful and memorable character that way.  BUT this is 2022 after #metoo and such.  I think going down some misogonistic or horn-dog rants might loose followers even if it fits with the grouchy old man.  Tread carefully... but there is definitely authentic color there for sure.


(I have NO idea about branding, Steve you need to think about this and try to provide a starting point, then I bet Justin will have a good gut reactions that you can use to refine your idea.  I will sit back and take notes, this is NOT my thing.)


MARKETING IDEAS
Our starting idea is that Steve is focusing on viral growth of super fans as his key driver for the business.  Still it will be critical to do some kind of marketing at least in the beginning in order to prime the pump.
- FRIENDS OF FRIENDS - telling your friends to tell their friends about the program is likely key, especially for the first handful of customers.  They will often put up with more crap in the beginning, and take more time to provide detailed feedback.
- EMAIL / CHANNEL SIGNUP - Getting folks to provide email signup or subscribe to your you tube channel will be key to having them not forget and come back.  Having an email list that you can ping right as your show starts would be key to getting folks to show up for the live set.
- LOCAL BUSINESSES - Perhaps 
- MARKETING FAVOR - 



A LA-CARTE THOUGHT
- There are a bunch of branding guys that argue there is the WHAT you do, HOW you do it and, WHY you do it, of your business.  Most focus on the WHAT you do or the HOW you do it.  (e.g. which songs, when you play etc. or how you execute your show).  But what really matters to your customer is WHY you have this business.  I know, I know the real reason is so you can pay for renovations on your place, and because it is the kind of music that you know best.  Yes those are WHY you what to choose this business.  But you need to dig deeper, think about what this kind of music means for you, what does having a community of listeners mean, what do think this music does for your fan's lives?  You need to get all touchy feely here, and identify some emotional center for your business.  When you write it down in print, it might seem a little corny.  That is ok, it just has to ring true for you -- it needs to really BE true at some level.  If you can identify this "why" it can help you frame your branding.  (You wont ever write it down in the corny form for your customer.  Instead it will be implicit in the way you frame your brand, and it will be a key part of why your super fans like you, and stick with you.)
- It can be REALLY hard to figure out exactly what this "why" might be in an authentic way.  Don't kill yourself over this, but do really give it a try, I think it is super key for the success of the business.  (If you are really interested in reading about it, there is crap tons of branding stuff you can read on this.)
