### - Printer Details
CHOICES:
- **Printer**:  [PrintingCenterUSA](https://www.printingcenterusa.com/year-book-printing)  800-955-1555
- **Binding**:   Saddle Stitch Binding.  (lays flat, lasts longer with wear.
  "Perfect bound" and "hard bound" both look better, but are not as practical)
- **Paper weight**: 100 Lb. paper for the text pages.  
  (This is their highest weight, it is like a nice magazine paper.)
- **Paper finish**:  Glossy finish for the text pages.   (this looks better for photos, and is a bit more durable.  Downside is it is harder to write on it, but I think we will not be signing our yearbooks.  right???  Matt finish is the alternative.
- **Cover paper**:  100 Lb. paper for the cover page.  (this is double thickness compared with the text pages...  any higher risks breaking in the binding)
- **Cover finish**: gloss cover with UV-high-gloss cover finish
- **Inking options**:  4/4 Full color option for all pages.  
- Double sided pages.
- **Book Dimensions**:  8.75" x 11.25" -

Here are my observations about 'print center USA' ... seems like they are solid quality for a very reasonable (almost but not quite) lowest price.  The main negative that I keep seeing is that if any thing is not quite right, they just cancel the order, and are not very helpful in resolving issues.  Still they have pretty strong overall numbers, so I am thinking we go with them.  We might want to pre-run our order with a smaller number, followed by the full order if all is well.  We are not time constrained, if needed we could switch and delay if there are issues we cannot fix.

Here is the full list of those whose pricing I looked at:
