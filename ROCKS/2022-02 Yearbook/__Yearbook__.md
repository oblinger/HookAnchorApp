Here are my observations about 'print center USA' ... seems like they are solid quality for a very reasonable (almost but not quite) lowest price.  The main negative that I keep seeing is that if any thing is not quite right, they just cancel the order, and are not very helpful in resolving issues.  Still they have pretty strong overall numbers, so I am thinking we go with them.  We might want to pre-run our order with a smaller number, followed by the full order if all is well.  We are not time constrained, if needed we could switch and delay if there are issues we cannot fix.

Here is the full list of those whose pricing I looked at:
