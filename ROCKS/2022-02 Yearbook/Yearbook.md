### - Announcement

Parents,

We are putting together a yearbook for each classroom at Big City this year!  It will feature two pages for each family within the class as well as photos of the teachers and the school too.  This will be a great way to remember your little one's year at Big City, a great way to see & remember the names and faces of the children and parents within in your child's class, plus100% of the proceeds for this will go to the BCPO scholarship fund. Its a three-way-win!

Participation is entirely voluntary. Included below are links to an online yearbook where each family can add two pages of photos. These can be taken from your favorite family photos and can also be copied from photos you received in our weekly newsletter. (My favorite is a deer-in-the-headlights, wide-eyed Eli looking into the camera, right after Anaya put her arm around his shoulder.) Please do add photos to the yearbook regardless of whether you plan to buy one, and please buy one regardless of whether you chose to put family photos into it.

We plan to showcase these yearbook pages at the upcoming Gala next month, so please put a first draft photos in now, so everyone can put names to faces for your whole family at the Gala. Edits will remain open until just before we print the yearbook later this summer. Please join us in this fun celebration of the community we have all help build here at Big City.

Cheers!
Dan Oblinger (Dad of Eli in Miss Soumya's class)

### - Printer Details
CHOICES:
- **Printer**:  [PrintingCenterUSA](https://www.printingcenterusa.com/year-book-printing)  800-955-1555
- **Binding**:   Saddle Stitch Binding.  (this lays flat when looking at each family's two pages. and it lasts longer with wear and tear.  On the other hand "Perfect bound" and "hard bound" both look better, but are not as practical)
- **Paper weight**: 100 Lb. paper for the text pages.  
  (This is their highest weight, it is like a nice magazine paper.)
- **Paper finish**:  Glossy finish for the text pages.   (this looks better for photos, and is a bit more durable.  Downside is it is harder to write on it, but I think we will not be signing our yearbooks.  right???  Matt finish is the alternative.
- **Cover paper**:  100 Lb. paper for the cover page.  (this is double thickness compared with the text pages...  any higher risks breaking in the binding)
- **Cover finish**: gloss cover with UV-high-gloss cover finish
- **Inking options**:  4/4 Full color option for all pages.  
- Double sided pages.
- **Book Dimensions**:  8.75" x 11.25" -

Printing Center USA reviews

Here are my observations about 'print center USA' ... seems like they are solid quality for a very reasonable (almost but not quite) lowest price.  The main negative that I keep seeing is that if any thing is not quite right, they just cancel the order, and are not very helpful in resolving issues.  Still they have pretty strong overall numbers, so I am thinking we go with them.  We might want to pre-run our order with a smaller number, followed by the full order if all is well.  We are not time constrained, if needed we could switch and delay if there are issues we cannot fix.

Here is the full list of those whose pricing I looked at:
