## = Executive Summary
After 2+ decades and building dozens of large PKMs these principles have yielded the absolute fastest PKM navigation.

**GOOD FOR?** -- If one hopes to improve a thing, one must first get clear on the ultimate purpose of that thing is.
In the case of a PKM we take its purpose to aid personal thinking during goal directed knowledge work.  
We believe the PKM-relevant aspects of knowledge work is largely covered by these three categories of PKM processing:
- **NAV** -- Getting back to a SPECIFIC piece of info you handled at a SPECIFIC time in the past.  (heavily weighted to)
- **GROK** -- Having a 'birds-eye-view' of a body of info relevant for some KM task.
- **SCAN** -- Sequentially processing all elements within a given scope as needed for some KM task.

**OPTOMIZING WHAT?** - Ok so a PKM should support those three actions, the human mind is very pliable, it could perform those actions given most any format.  So what are the aspects of an ideal PKM arrangement.  We believe the effectiveness of a PKM can be assessed via these three broad related metrics:
- EFFICIENCY -- 
- LOAD -- 
- **FLOW** -- Providing relevant K w/o breaking mental flow.




**SETS & STREAMS** -- Using PKM over time means understanding it over time.  This requires conserved structure.


**GLOBAL 2 LOCAL** -- Remember dozens or hundreds of special global "G" pages that serve as the starting point for navigation, then use the emergent LOCAL structure found at that G page in order to complete the search.
- **UNIFIED NAMESPACE** -- Critical that all "G" pages exist within one namespace.  Many Gs will have info in many different places, formats, and kinds.  All that stuff must be in one G-"Place" so it can be access
- **OPEN LOOP NAV** -- Critical that one can navigate to any "G" place literally with eyes closed.
- **OPPORTUNISTIC G-ROUTING** --  
-  and user should not need to think about storage location/kind, app-type, etc.  just the G-name in their brain


**EFFICIENCY** - Cognitive, Perceptual, Physical, and Workflow efficiencies are paramount.  Small improvements afford large gains.
