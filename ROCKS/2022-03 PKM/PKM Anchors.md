tl;dr.  Maintain a thousand or so anchor terms as sets, streams, rocks, or topics in order to directly jump to any info in your personal knowledge store.


PKM Anchors -- Sets, Streams, Rocks, and Topics

A PKM should be an evolving conversation between your mind and and and associated digital store.  In order for this conversation to be productive it is important that the terms you use to index your mind and your digital store stay in sync.  This ensures you can merely think of a thing and already how it is organized into your PKM.  Over time the topics indexed evolve, thus the terms must also evolve, but in order to be remembered, it is critical that we manage this evolution so it is not too quick, and so that the association of information to terms is remembered indefinitely.


ANCHOR TERM -- An anchor term is a short, memorable alpha numeric phrase with an understood boundary specifying which pieces of information are and are not associated with that anchor.

Many will push back, "oh my thinking it too fluid in order to put into boxes like that!"  Its true, the web of links between our thoughts is quite complex and does not fit into boxes.  Still with care we, create mental rules that provide a simple in/out designation for any piece of info.  Then we need to ensure these rules can be maintained in a consistent way indefinitely, and that we can consistently arbitrate when multiple anchors apply to a single piece of info.  If this all sounds like a very tall order, it is, but it is also quite possible, and once you have done this, managing a sprawling PKM becomes a pieces of cake, even as it grows over decades of continuous aggregation!  Here is the structure that I have evolved over the last 20+ years of usage.  There are four types of anchors:

- SETS -- These anchors manage collections of some common underlying type:  e.g. all people, or memorable quotes.
- STREAMS -- These are sets that are further organized by time into a stream of items
- ROCKS -- These are larger, time-bounded, topics or activities.  E.g. "the zzz proposal"
- TOPICS -- These are timeless (evergreen) notes around which we have built a taxonomy of info for that topic.  e.g. finance

The arbitration rule is to always put items into SETS before STREAMS before ROCKS before TOPICS.  Important information can subsequently be put into other buckets, but it is critical that it is always associated with the earliest anchor that way it will be there when retrieval is attempted.

SETS are easy.  We know what the type of info is, so it is completely obvious if a piece of info fits into a set based on what it is.  Is it a person, well then it goes into people.  Is it a URL reference then it goes into references.  But often we want to indicate the type of a thing, but then ALSO organize that info according to time or topic as well.  As described below, this system allows us to do both of those things at the same time, since it is such a common thing to do.

STREAMS are easy.  These are just sets whose items are inherently organized by time.  For example meeting notes are indexed by the date when the meeting occurred, and url references can be organized by the date that one collected it.  Adding the time dimension is quite critical for large sets.  Over years a PKM can become a cesspool of complexity without the use of steams since each category grows so big nothing can be found.  But often one can limit ones looking to an approximate month or year, which keeps the found information constant, regardless of how long the PKM has been growing.

ROCKS are easy.  These are streams whose elements each have an anchoring name that is relevant for some period of many months.  This is large enough and slow enough that one can remember the anchor name for the period that it is active, and when scrolling thru a list of all rock anchors with one-line descriptions one can remember the meaning of the rock anchor even a decade or two later.  A rock might be the final essay for a class, a job search you did in 2018, 

TOPICS are easy.  These are just rocks with no expiration date.  They are an area of information are evergreen, they will remain relevant, and meaningfully-named forever.  For example, MED (Medical/Health related info) and FIN (Finance related info) are two such anchors for me.  Since these anchor pages will be viewed many many times, it makes sense that we organize them well.  Think of each these as a landing page or a routing page -- they are organized in order to point the reader in the correct direction for ALL info that falls under the purview of this topic.


## USAGE

So how is all of this used?  Generally 


TOPICS
- A small two-level outline (which fits on one screen!) can be crafted used if there are many sub- or related- topics for this one.
- Streaming info related to this topic is attached directly to this page in a LOG section at the bottom.
- Very cohesive topics or documents can use the folding-text feature to directly embed a significant amount of info into a nested outline of upto three or four levels deep.
