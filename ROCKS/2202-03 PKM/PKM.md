## = Executive Summary
After 2+ decades and building dozens of large PKMs these principles have yielded the absolute fastest PKM navigation.

GLOBAL 2 LOCAL -- Remember dozens or hundreds of special global "G" pages that serve as the starting point for navigation, then use the emergent LOCAL structure found at that G page in order to complete the search.
- OPEN LOOP NAV -- Critical that one can navigate to any "G" place literally with eyes closed.
- ONE NAMESPACE -- Critical that all "G" pages exist within one namespace.  Many Gs will have info in many different places, formats, and kinds.  All that stuff must be in one G-"Place" so it can be access
- OPPORTUNISTIC G-ROUTING --  
-  and user should not need to think about storage location/kind, app-type, etc.  just the G-name in their brain

# Key Ideas

## LOCAL-GLOBAL BUCKETING
A (*the*?) most important aspect of any PKM is the amount of volume and density of relevant information one can access per minute.  Thus shaving even small percentages off the mental, temporal, and physical ease of navigating to some desired piece of knowledge GREATLY boosts the value of the PKM.  After 3 decades of organizing dozens of PKMs here is what I believe to be a set of best practices for achieving the highest levels of PKM nav efficiency, and how I have implemented them in Obsidian.

### - BUCKETING


### GLOBAL 2 LOCAL 
To keep things separated in our own minds we remember or invent names to 'hook' onto.  So when you have the idea to get some bit of info, you already have some names in your mind, the global 2 local strategy begins from those names

#### UNIFIED GLOBAL NAMESPACE
- All things that are named thing 

Significant cognitive 

LOCAL FOLDER STRUCTURE


OPEN LOOP NAV
Close your eyes, let someone else navigate your PKM to a random page, now with your fingers on your home row keys let them suggest any one of your hundred+ global pages.  You are have an open loop PKM if you are able to successfully navigate to the correct global page
, now type your way to 


### - PROGRESSIVE REFINEMENT

Idea: Many pages improve overall efficiency by optimizing effort in WRITE the page (at expense of reading the page), A smaller number are the reverse where optimizing READING of the page far out weighs cost of writing it.
THUS: 
- We want to allow all points on the READ/WRITE tradeoff efficiencies.
- We want to allow progressive refinement for the likely cases where we don't know apriori the best tradeoff for the page.
