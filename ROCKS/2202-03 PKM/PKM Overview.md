## = Executive Summary
After 2+ decades and building dozens of large PKMs these principles have yielded the absolute fastest PKM navigation.


**GOOD FOR?**
- **NAV** -- Getting back to a SPECIFIC piece of info you handled at a SPECIFIC time in the past.  (heavily weighted to)
- **GROK** -- Having a 'birds-eye-view' of a body of info relevant for some KM task.
- **SCAN** -- Sequentially processing all elements within a given scope as needed for some KM task.
- **FLOW** -- Providing relevant K w/o breaking mental flow.


**GLOBAL 2 LOCAL** -- Remember dozens or hundreds of special global "G" pages that serve as the starting point for navigation, then use the emergent LOCAL structure found at that G page in order to complete the search.
- **OPEN LOOP NAV** -- Critical that one can navigate to any "G" place literally with eyes closed.
- **UNIFIED NAMESPACE** -- Critical that all "G" pages exist within one namespace.  Many Gs will have info in many different places, formats, and kinds.  All that stuff must be in one G-"Place" so it can be access
- **OPPORTUNISTIC G-ROUTING** --  
-  and user should not need to think about storage location/kind, app-type, etc.  just the G-name in their brain


**STREAMS & SETS** -- Using PKM over time means understanding it over time.  Requires conserved structure.


**EFFICIENCY** - Cognitive, Perceptual, Physical, and Workflow efficiencies are paramount.  Small improvements afford large gains.
