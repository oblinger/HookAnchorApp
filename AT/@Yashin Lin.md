### n2022-10-15  Yashin Self Summary after loosing her job

One thing that has resulted from those process is that, bc M was committed to knowing whether I could be a fit, she's given me discuss things to think about. She *was* my coach in terms of diagnosing what I have a tendency to do that was not helpful in this context. Hope you don't mind my writing this out (I should be writing in a journal but feel more compelled to write off there is an audience): I have a tendency to complicate things. Consultants are supposed to simplify things for their clients. So not only is this tendency something that works against what my time should be, but I shoot myself in the foot. That's what certainly contributed to my assignments taking longer than the time alloted. I mean, certainly they are underbudgeted, but in this context, a tendency to not see things simply (I think, focusing on the end goal and

quickly discerning the key issues or the most important things that will address the clients' goals) adds to the time I take to get things done. No one complained about this in this case openly, but in the end, this is an exercise each of these indicators goes through every 3 years. We need to check off the box, make sure major issues are addressed, then maybe there are key areas across that everyone can learn and that could be a capacity building exercise. It's not my tendency to see the big picture --too often I see it afterwards. 

  

I think the exercise of making an SOP was a good learning opportunity even for some USAID staff (one wrote me as much) but overall, I just made my life more difficult.. this is perhaps why Michelle said maybe research might be a better fit. I'm not sure that's true, but the idea of being very systematic, analytical. In real life you bring value by identifying the Pareto principle issues, even in research. And there are time constraints and clients in research too.   

  

The big project that took a lot of time was to assess data quality of indicators reported to Congress. The process includes identifying major and minor issues. I systematically identified a lot of both type of issues and recommended that most IPs develop SOPs for the target indicators.. the argument is that if the process is simple, it shouldn't take long. If it isn't, then an SOP is even more justified. Well, everyone is busy and overworked... In retrospect it was a bit too blunt a knife. 

  

I do see this tendency in other parts of my life. I have a certain way I think things should take place, and automatic mode can take over, rather than take a step back and look at the big picture. 

  

Ouf I was going to copy Collette but I think she'd be concerned about talking about personal stuff in Google. Not that that is unjustified

  

Ok back to sleep

~~ DANS EXAMPLE
  
No problem writing this to me.  I think it is a great time to reflect.  Indeed I think even this thinking itself can be a chance to practice simplifying.

  

I think there are some good lessons in all of this… and boiling them down into a few key things to work on and consider can be a chance to practice this simplification.

  

Yes, I think you have a tendency to look for the exceptions rather than the simplification that is mostly right.

I recall trying to get a summary of your forward looking committed LOE.  The first 10 minutes of that discussion was you explaining that it was impossible for you to really tell me much of anything about this.  But by the end of 30 min of discussion we were able to come up with a way to think very productively about your LOE estimates.  In the end all of the knowledge was in your head, not mine.  Indeed initially I had a pretty wrong understanding of the correct kind of analysis.  And in discussion it was corrected into a good way of estimating and summarizing for you manager.  So all the knowledge was in your head.  But notice your first 10 minutes of discussion was you emphatically telling me you couldn’t possible conclude ANYTHING with any certainty.

  

Notice it was not that you were not CAPABLE of deriving that summary, eventually you did it.  but you were not really TRYING to.

Your energies were devoted to explaining how any such summary would be inherently inaccurate and uncertain in so many different ways.

  

Notice that is also an example of not looking at it from your supervisors perspective:

  

From your perspective you were uncomfortable giving her a summary that might be wrong.

But from her perspective such a summarization is required and you are putting this onto HER, where she has even less context and time than you do for making this summary.

  

I think these concrete situations and details are golden opportunities to learn.

  

Notice in the example above, you were VERY capable of doing the summarization task.  It was not a matter of competence.

It was a matter of perspective and wisdom to even try to do it.  I think this is good news, since I think the latter new perspective is very learnable.
