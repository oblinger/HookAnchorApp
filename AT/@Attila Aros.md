Subj:  Recommendation Letter

Attila,
How goes it?  I am wondering if the crashing cryptos is having any blowback effect on you?

I am in the midst to prepping to go back out on the job market.  Lots of the positions that I would look at would involve some management, so it would be great to get a letter of recommendation from someone who worked for Analytics Fire.  If that sounds good to you, here are some starter thoughts (but I am happy for you to figure out your own too):

- The culture and management at Analytics Fire allowed you to grow as a software engineer, and eventually as a crypto entrepreneur too.
- Dan provided guidance that that extended beyond just my work at Analytics Fire and included helping me in forming my company, giving feedback on business choices, teaming choices, how to secure funding, as well as act as provide pretty deep technical perspective on the technical ideas driving my current company.

Maybe there is an anecdote that could be included about one or another of our discussions?
I would not make the letter too long, a large paragraph or two smaller ones is more than enough.

Happy to help with it, if writing it is a pain.


And we really are over due for a chat.  What is a good time in the next week or two for a catch up?

Cheers, 
Dan
