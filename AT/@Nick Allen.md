### t2022-06-28  Request for Letter of reference

Nick, 
I am getting my public persona together for interviewing.  You have been the constant factor over the last 8 years, so I think it would be great to get a letter of reference from you.  Perhaps a longer one that can be sent, but for the moment I am focused on having one on my linked-in.  This one should be a couple of paragraphs, but not so long that folks wont read it.  

Let me know if you have the bandwidth to write one.

Thanks!

Here are 




### m2021-07-28 - Meeting with Nick and Michael

-- Need for money fucks things up
	-- I SHOULD be accountable to my 'users'
	-- But need to turn $300K plus profit quickly, limit impact & directions
	-- I had it, and I let it go.
	-- On paper I wrote $150K-$400K before marriage.
	-- Mid-stream on two decade idea.  Sad to drop it.
-- Depressed.  anxious.  shell shocked.  Not in a good decision-making frame

Ready to sacrifice all
- Was ready to sacrifice everything be in a spot where my time is spent thinking hard thoughts, in impactful areas, alternating with deep dives into the market to make one connect.
  	(not clear I have skills.  I have 3 year attention, but maybe not 10yr)
  
  -- Don't feel I spent last 10 years in an effective way.
  	-- Always favored less risky, less motivating paths first, never went beyond
  	-- Nearly all attempt were not well formed, or nor well mentored
  	-- Whole time were string half attempts, made w/ half conviction,
  	-- My aim was lowest risk path to lifestyle, so never reached.
  	-- Good evidence that I do operate very differently given different context 
  
  -- Nick says
  	-- Lack conviction to drive in a single direction.  True.
  But that is because multiple directions are all acceptable
  	-- Perhaps too late to take on the risk of a startup 
  	-- All have significant risks
  
  -- When happy:
  	Technical Ideation.  & Leading a team technically.  Enjoy multiplication.   
  -- Aspects:
  	Enjoy super deep, on multiple.  Thinking time exists. flexibilty which first

### m2021-07-27 - Nick's request info

1. Make a decision tree of the choices you are evaluating & probably outcomes
2. Score the outcomes based on 3-5 metrics you care about
3. Assign probability to the outcomes
4. Talk to like 5 people in the know & ask them for feedback. They will probably give you feedback that updates the tree, especially around probability, but maybe also sanity checks about what it’s like
