### t2022-07-26  Notes for letter of reference

IDEAS:

Dan is a high energy and capable leader across many dimensions:

- I watched Dan rapidly build out a team of the highest quality team of 40+ PhD specialists using sophisticated combination of scaled outreach and assessment along with innovative university partnerships.     

- Dan is fast on his feet and creative, both in a high stakes client meetings, or in working with the team in overcoming unexpected execution problems threatening delivery schedules.    (diluted)

- He is an unusual combination of very technical at the lowest levels, and very articulate, organized, and compelling at the highest level.  

- He quickly comes up to speed in disparate technical sub-areas in order to help the team creatively problem solve with the team, or to pitch a new approaches for a new client.  Often on the heels of our first meeting with a new client, it would be Dan proposing how our or other technologies might productively apply to their problems.  

- Dan is a creative technical problem solver, he gets up to speed in very deeply into new areas and works with the team to propose new solutions to new clients, or to help attack details within ongoing projects.  

- As a leader dan is very process oriented allowing him to effectively structure organizations and execution for greatest effect.  In one of our more technically complex efforts he built out a two-level reporting structure that streamlined integrations in a way that afford highest development speeds.

- Finally Dan has the highest levels of integrity.  This has been a crucial ingredient in maintaining the trust and alignment we needed as co-founders over the twists and turns that occur in founding a company founding.  And that integrity along with a kind of infectious energy allows him to hire, retain, and lead world class technical talent.

### t2022-06-28  Request for Letter of reference

Nick, 
I am getting my public persona together for interviewing.  You have been the constant factor over the last 8+ years, so I think it would be great to get a letter of reference from you.  Perhaps a longer one that can be sent, but for the moment I am focused on having one on my linked-in.  This one should be a couple of paragraphs, but not so long that folks wont read it.  

Let me know if you have the bandwidth to write one.

Thanks!
--dan


In many ways you are better at this, than I am, so feel free to take the note in any direction you see fit.
If it saves you time, here are some ideas that came to me...


Perhaps it can be structured around the fact that we have been co-founders and in every big decision I have been an able "right hand man".
Just an overall sense that we were in the trenches for many years together, and look forward to the next chance we get to jump into the trenches with him.
Also, consistent with the CTO title and the idea of an AI practice, I was your 'go to person' for technical questions and particularly for AI/ML related ones.

A-la-carte ideas:
- Strong in constructing processes.
- Strong ability to hire world class talent within competitive markets.
- Having high EQ enabling me to support and retain rarified talent.  (ok, so I think that was majority YOUR effort, still I think I do have pretty strong EQ and was a positive influence when I was more active)
- Fast on feet.  Strong at presenting in high consequence meetings.  
- Able create and coalesce others around a strong technical vision.  (here I am thinking mostly about Aeolus, as I had less chance for that on other AF projects)
- Innovative in finding pragmatic solutions to problems.
- Good executive judgement about people and about business decisions.




### m2021-07-28 - Meeting with Nick and Michael

-- Need for money fucks things up
	-- I SHOULD be accountable to my 'users'
	-- But need to turn $300K plus profit quickly, limit impact & directions
	-- I had it, and I let it go.
	-- On paper I wrote $150K-$400K before marriage.
	-- Mid-stream on two decade idea.  Sad to drop it.
-- Depressed.  anxious.  shell shocked.  Not in a good decision-making frame

Ready to sacrifice all
- Was ready to sacrifice everything be in a spot where my time is spent thinking hard thoughts, in impactful areas, alternating with deep dives into the market to make one connect.
  	(not clear I have skills.  I have 3 year attention, but maybe not 10yr)
  
  -- Don't feel I spent last 10 years in an effective way.
  	-- Always favored less risky, less motivating paths first, never went beyond
  	-- Nearly all attempt were not well formed, or nor well mentored
  	-- Whole time were string half attempts, made w/ half conviction,
  	-- My aim was lowest risk path to lifestyle, so never reached.
  	-- Good evidence that I do operate very differently given different context 
  
  -- Nick says
  	-- Lack conviction to drive in a single direction.  True.
  But that is because multiple directions are all acceptable
  	-- Perhaps too late to take on the risk of a startup 
  	-- All have significant risks
  
  -- When happy:
  	Technical Ideation.  & Leading a team technically.  Enjoy multiplication.   
  -- Aspects:
  	Enjoy super deep, on multiple.  Thinking time exists. flexibilty which first

### m2021-07-27 - Nick's request info

1. Make a decision tree of the choices you are evaluating & probably outcomes
2. Score the outcomes based on 3-5 metrics you care about
3. Assign probability to the outcomes
4. Talk to like 5 people in the know & ask them for feedback. They will probably give you feedback that updates the tree, especially around probability, but maybe also sanity checks about what it’s like
