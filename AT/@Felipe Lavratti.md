Felipe,
How is Amazon after a year+ in the grind?  I have finally sold Analytics Fire to R-Zero, they have some pretty unique viral disinfection technologies, I have high hopes they will make me filthy rich too  :-).  I would love to catch up in the next weeks to tell you about it, and get your input on my next ideas too.

Cheers,
