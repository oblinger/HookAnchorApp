Subj:  A transition into Venture Capital

Melissa,
I am a 3-exit entrepreneur in the midst of selling my current company and quietly exploring a transition into Venture Capital.  I have applied my PhD in CS (Machine Learning) towards exited companies in both AI (Clean tech) and Robotics, but am now thinking about applying these skills in support of a VC fund or its portfolio companies.  

I spoke with Aniket Kumar at Software Growth Partners and he suggested you might be an ideal person for me to connect with and to gain insights about the VC industry from. Looking online I see why!  Much of my efforts have been in guiding teams in earlier stages of innovation, at Aeolus Robotics and DARPA among others. I see you are specifically focused on seed and series-A which is fantastic.  And you have more than a decade of experience in the AI and robotics field, so I could not ask for a more qualified perspective on the industry!

If you have time for a 10-15min chat, I would love to get your advice regarding how I might dig deeper, and how my experience might best be applied with the venture space.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
--Dan
