Subj: Technology Focused Venture Capital

Hi Emily,
- CONTEXT:  I am a serial entrepreneur in the midst of selling my current company and quietly exploring what might be next for me.
- STRENGTH:  I have used my PhD in Computer Science (Machine Learning) to found/exit 3 companies and fund/lead over $200M in R&D while at DARPA.
- STRENGTH:  I recently spoke with Prime Movers Labs and others about how this experience might provide value to VC firms or their portfolio companies.
- PATH: Aniket Kumar at Software Growth Partners spoke highly of you and your focus on placement within technology focused firms.
- ASK:  I believe a 10-15 minute chat could help me better understand the industry as well as provide guidance towards most relevant people and areas given my background.  Let me know your interest and availability.
- Best, Dan Oblinger, Founder/CTO Analytics Fire
- P.S.  Through a collaboration I have an interest/understanding in blockchain, perhaps in a later conversation we might talk about directions for Web3

Your firm and background is in place into technical VC/PE firms so it seems you are likely knowledge
