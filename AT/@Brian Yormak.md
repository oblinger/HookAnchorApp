# # MEETINGS 
### t2022-10-25  Ask to speak

- Chance join in on Sports Visio as CTO, and doing my diligence.
- I am convinced about the tech, and about the market pull.
- I want to understand what will be required for a solid A-round?
- What exit multiples are investors going to be looking for?
- Jason listed $1.5B for the world wide TAM for basketball.  Is that big enough?
	- Do we need to show capability in a second sport, in order for the larger $15B TAM to be relevant?


A-ROUND - I want to understand what will be required for a solid A-round?
1. Mk Size.
2. Engagement on product
3. Competitive land scape
4. Traction


(1) MARKET SIZE

Multiples dont matter  at series A.    Its no problem if you 20x  5x or 50x
- AS LONG AS YOU ARE UNDERWRITING A LARGE ENOUGH MARKET

At story ventures we take a more aggressive stance towards only underwriting large opportunities.
We like to see a path to a $10B business.  (E.g. a business with a $400M EBITA)

But many will be happy with a $1B dollar business.


THE KEY FOR SV TO PROVE MARKET SIZE
- Prove you have a strong path to upstream markets with known large TAMS (e.g. HUDL)
	- Not enough to prove you are lower cost, need to prove market adoption hinges on cost.
- OR prove you have a path to many sport domination, and one will expect one larger winner in this space, or you have a path to acquire others to build some kind of conglomerate.
	- But realistically can one company grab multiple sports given other companies are out there?


MULTIPLE SPORTS
- At the A-round there is no need to have built support for a second sport.  Indeed doing this is probably a distraction.
- Instead one needs to have a strong case why the economics work out.
	- He was skeptical that there would be strong tech reuse across sports.  (yes there would be some, but each sport pays attention to different things.)    [I briefly argued for significant but not complete overlap and he seemed to buy it to some degree]
	- Then we spoke about non-tech overlap in sales channels and adoption patterns.  He clearly got that, but we would need to demostrate this was actually a potential in the market itself... not just on paper.  (e.g. get relevant people saying relevant things)



(2) PRODUCT ENGAGEMENT
- Are teams using the product on each game?  Is this an "experiment" for them, or is this already established a critical for them?
- strong proof on product market fit

- Wanted proof of lifetime value.  Low turn over.  Stickiness.

- I briefly mentioned your approach in building relationships with leagues, and how B2B relationships like that are often quite sticky.
  He clearly saw the truth in this.


(3) COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

- Angle for displacing upstream competitors
- How does SV related to other CV companies doing sports or other adjacent CV domains.
  (he felt on needed to worry about eventual competition from non-sports based solutions.)


(4) TRACTION

- who is adopting this, 
- how much paying, 
- How confidence of an eventual upsell, 
- What do the growth curves look like
- Do they continue to use the product, or is this still an "experiment" for them.


HE TALKED ALOT ABOUT HARDWARE
- Long term will this be dominated by companies that have vertically integrated hardware?
- 
What is the right long term form factor.  (is it a mobile phone?  or specialized hardware?)



KEY IDEA
if product is live and you like it.  push investors to SEE the product.  go to a basket ball game.  or set up the device and let them play 2 on two game.

Brian,
I trust you have been well.  The sale of my company is going great.  If you recall we spoke as you did diligence on Sports Visio, and at the end of that call offered that I might reach out if I had questions in the future; I am hoping to take you up on that.

Jason and I are discussing me joining Sports Visio as CTO.  In my own diligence for the role, I am wanting clarity on what they will need to show in order to raise a strong A round.  My questions are narrow and focused, so I believe a couple of minutes will suffice.  Feel free to just call, or we can pick a time.  thanks!


- Needed for a Solid-A?   Market traction?  Tech?  Second 
- HUDL raised $500M at a $2B value.  TAM. 




### m2022-03-29
Spoke with him about his potential investment in [[@Sports Visio]].
At the end of our discussion he offered to have a conversation with me about becoming a VC. 
I plan to take him up on this offer.
