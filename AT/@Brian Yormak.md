### t2022-10-19  Ask to speak

Brian,
I trust you have been well.  The sale of my company is going great.  If you recall we spoke as you did diligence on Sports Visio, and at the end of that call offered that I might reach out if I had questions in the future; I am hoping to take you up on that.

Jason and I are discussing me joining Sports Visio as CTO.  In my own diligence for the role, I am wanting clarity on what they will need to show in order to raise a strong A round.  My questions are narrow and focused, so I believe a couple of minutes will suffice.  Feel free to just call, or we can pick a time.  thanks!


- Needed for a Solid-A?   Market traction?  Tech?  Second 
- HUDL raised $500M at a $2B value.  TAM.

Spoke with him about his potential investment in [[@Sports Visio]].
At the end of our discussion he offered to have a conversation with me about becoming a VC. 
I plan to take him up on this offer.
