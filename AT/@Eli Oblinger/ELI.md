### 2022-11-23  QL planting ideas

- Eli was calling out for mom, so Dan comes out to play with him, and we play for a bit.
- QL comes down to play for the next hour (at is usual at lunch time)
- All three play for a period, with Dan and Eli building magnets.
- Quietly when locking eyes with QL, Dan says "your turn, I need to get back to work"    (Not clear if Eli heard or attended to this, he was not looking, and did not react or look up, just continued running around)
- About 20 second the train derails and Eli tries to fix it, but then has difficulty
- Hey yells, "Arrrgh!"  and crashes the train and the building we are building.  (its just a modest outburst)
- QL says,  "oh Eli are you mad because Daddy is going back to work?"
	- she then explains why this is ok, because she is helping to process this.

Its possible, but quite unlikely that my statement had any connection to his frustration in failing to get the train back on the track.

Still we know for certain his frustration was immediately caused by not being able to get the train back on the track.
