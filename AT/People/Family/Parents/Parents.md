### Remote Assistnace

The Windows XP functionality I was discussing is called Remote Assistance.  It must be enabled in the system that is requesting assistance (e.g., your father’s system).  


Requesting help using Remote Assistance


Sometimes the best way to fix a problem is to have someone show you how. Remote Assistance is a convenient way for a distant friend to connect to your computer from another computer running a compatible operating system, such as Windows XP, and walk you through your solution.

By following the easy steps in Remote Assistance, you can use Windows Messenger Service or an e-mail message to invite a friend to connect to your computer. After he or she is connected, your friend will be able to view your computer screen and chat with you in real time about what you both see. With your permission, your assistant can even use his or her mouse and keyboard to work with you on your computer.

To start Remote Assistance

1.	Click Start, and then click Help and Support. 
2.	Click Invite a friend to connect to your computer with Remote Assistance. 

Notes

- #	Both you and your helper must be using either Windows Messenger Service or a MAPI-compliant e-mail account such as Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express. 
- #	You and your helper need to be connected to the Internet while using Remote Assistance. 
- #	If you are working on a local area network, firewalls might stop you from using Remote Assistance. In this case, check with your network administrator before using Remote Assistance. 
- #	If for some reason you are unable to send an invitation by using e-mail or Windows Messenger Service, you can create and save an invitation. On the first page of Remote Assistance, click Invite someone to help you. On the next page, click Save invitation as a file (Advanced), and follow the instructions to save the file. You can then send the saved invitation file to your helper in the manner you choose, such as copying it onto a floppy disk or a shared network location, sending it over another e-mail service or an FTP connection, and so on. 

 

- #	You and the person you are helping need to be connected to the Internet while using Remote Assistance. 
- #	If you are working on a local area network, firewalls might stop you from using Remote Assistance. If you have not sent your invitation by using Windows Messenger, try that. If that doesn't work, ask your assistant or administrator to add port 3389 for you.

### Dave O Loan


may

10K

visa



Dave O,

I wrote the following a couple of weeks ago, am just now getting around to sending it and the cash:

-------------------------------

I think this is the plan we agreed to, I just want it to write it down so we have a plan no matter how thing do or don't work.
Here are the parts of the money:

       CAR PRICE
           PARTS
    +  LEFT OVER
    ------------
      TOTAL LOAN


  # I will send cash 'TOTAL LOAN' above, and as soon as you buy the car, you price the major PARTS 
  needed for the car, and send me back the 'LEFT OVER' that same week.  (If the rest of the LEFT OVER
  gets spent, you wont have profits when you sell the car, and that will suck.)

  # We didn't say so on the phone, but since I ain't chargin interest, if you haven't bought a car in a month, just
  send that cash back...

  # If the actual cost of the parts is a bit more, you can just cover that from you own money,
  if a part is way more than you guessed, let me know, and we we can deal with that separately.

  # As soon as you sell the car, you pay me CAR PRICE + PARTS, immediately before you pay rent, or salaries
  etc.  This maximizes the chances that each car will land in the black with the loan from me
  fully paid off.

  # Let's just do a zero percent loan.  As long as we keep the time of the loan short, 
  I will only be loosing a couple hundred bucks...  I can survive  :-)

  # But lets pick a time period now where the loan would have interest:  If by some bizarre reason 
  we had not sold the car in SIX months, then lets make the whole loan be at 10% interest
  starting from day one.  Basically this should just #NEVER# happen.

  # Also since I am not making any money on this deal, I really don't want to loose money either!
  So if for whatever reason a car does not sell for as much as you paid for it, then you
  may not have enough money to pay me back.  If you don't we will just add the amount to the
  loan that you already have with me.   (Lets hope this doesn't happen either!)

  # When you get your payout from DHL you will just send the whole thing to me to pay down your
  loan with me.  This has the double benefit, of getting this loan out of our hair, and also
  making sure that if these cars sell at a loss, at least our total loan amount is probably not
  be worse than where it is today.


I think I have thought of all the bad crap that could happen!  Better to have
a plan for rainy whether, than to get wet.  Hopefully, it will be just the opposite,
and this buisness can get underway!

Let me know if all this sounds right, and let me know when I should paypal the $7000!
