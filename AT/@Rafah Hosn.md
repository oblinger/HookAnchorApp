### t2022-07-20  Reconnect

Bozo,
How is it that we were best of friend in NYC, and then I head off to startup land and let that all fall away?!  I am selling my Cleantech/AI business and would love to get your advice on my next steps, but I ALSO would love to catch up on life too.  I (finally) have a young son to tell you about and I am sure you do too.

If you have time for two different calls, maybe we can have a catch up call first?  (If too busy, for all of that, I totally understand!)

Anyway it is super to get to write.  looking forward to connecting again.
 
cheers,
danny
