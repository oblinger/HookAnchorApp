Subj:  Letter of Reference

Joe,
I am winding things up at Analytics Fire, the acquisition is nearly done, and I managed to avoid any handcuffs.  I am going to do some interviewing, and would love to get a letter of reference from you.  I think we worked really well together and I am proud of what we built too, so I think it would be great to talk about with prospective employers.  Let me know if you have the time to do one for me.

Also I would love to get together for a coffee sometime.  The triumphs and setbacks are both better shared over a cup of joe from time to time.  I am not sure how often you are in the city, but it has been ages since we hung out!

let me know on that too.

Cheers, 
Dan
