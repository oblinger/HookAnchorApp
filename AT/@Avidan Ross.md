### m2022-10-13  Intro meeting


Selling my company, and before really looking, I have an interesting co-founder offer.
Tessa just thought I should chat at least a tiny bit before jumping in.


- Quick Intro:   
	- AI-PhD from UIUC illinois.  
	- 7 years as a ML researcher at IBM Watson & teaching in Columbia's EE department.  
	- 6 years as a DARPA PM.  Funded over $200M in programs all centered on ML
	- Then as a co-founder CTO in a string of exited startups:
		- First started as a recommendation play which pivoted into a specialty payments platform
		- The second is Martian robotics.  Sold to Aeolus where I joined and grew a 60+ person world class robotics team.
		- The third is the one I am selling now:  It is a clean tech cosultancy focused on building end to end SW solutions for HW companies.
		  Usually centered on Machine Learning or IoT.  couple billion dollars worth of devices in the field


- What kind of TAM and what kind of targeted exits size would you view as the minimum size required in order to be solidly investable?
- This is a late joining co-founder/CTO role.  double digit equity and $200K salary.

Send me an email with a brief description of you and what you're interested in, and I can forward it to him and see if he's willing to chat with you.

Advian,
I am selling my company and quietly look for my next thing--perhaps another startup, or perhaps advising across a range of startups.  I told Tessa that my sweetspot is leading teams in stages where significant technical risk exists.  She mentioned that this seemed to align really well with the kinds of investing that you do, and that perhaps we should talk.

Avidan, 
Subj: Advice for a future advisor

I am selling my 40 person AI/cleantech startup and quietly look for my next thing--perhaps another startup, or perhaps advising across a range of startups.  I told Tessa that my sweet spot is leading teams in stages where significant technical risk exists.  She mentioned that this seemed to align well with the kinds of investing that you do, and that perhaps we should talk.  

As background, I’m a 3-exit, AI/ML/Robotics CTO-PhD who’s managed $200+M in R&D at DARPA and build several engineering orgs of up to 60+ in size.  My sweet spot led me to consider being an advisor/EIR providing support across multiple startups.  I would like to get advice from those in early-stage, deep-tech venture funding --- and that seems to be EXACTLY you!  

We swim in similar waters; it would be great to connect over coffee or lunch.

Thanks much!
