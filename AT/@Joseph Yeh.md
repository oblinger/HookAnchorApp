### m2022-12-07  [[resLI#2022-12-07  Framing Self]] 

Jake

### m2022-12-01  Prep for [[@Jason Syversen]] 'final' discussion.


OUTLINE:
- Grzegorz discussion.  What did you think?  Any negatives?  Moving forward?
- SV status and find the pain discussion:
	- INVESTORS:  Are checks written?   What caps&targets will drive the A?  When do you begin A-round?  Scheduled touch base meetings prior? 
	- CUSTOMERS:  Realtime & Stats customers.  Any informal MOUs?  What usage data do you need prior to the A?
		- Analysis on what percentage of prime segment will signup for alternate MVP features?
		- Analysis for takers for a real-time augmentation for other products?
		- What percent of your time last month have you put towards this?
	- TECH:  Both products in alpha?
	- ROADMAP:  What is your roadmap over then next 3 months, 6month, 9months?  

- THE ASK:  As I listen to you over the last two years I feel you have been in fire-fighting mode with the whole company centered on Jason.
	- Its not the ideal way build a market leading company that requires significant new tech AND significantly many business partnerships.
		- What is your Super power?    Driving vision and external leading of company, not tech strategy 
	- You should have a hit-all-the-bases technical partner:
		- Fire in the belly to drive urgency in the team.
		- Able to stretch all the way from optimizing an R&D roadmap to leading rapid execution.
		- Able to cultivate a fun high-energy, high-engagement team with very low turn-over.
		- Able to find and hire world class talent for highly specialized roles, in a high-speed, cost sensitive, and world-wide way.
		- Able to think deeply at the technical level AND at the business level at the same time.  Key to driving efficient productization at all stages.
		- Able to be compelling and articulate in high stakes investor meetings and during diligence talks as well.
	- You should have that partner NOW.  Team is rolling over now, and should be 100% outward facing right now, readying to complete the A-round in Q1.
	- The one thing you can never get back is time.
	- So what do you think?  Are you in?  Can we formalize this before end of year?


- Been in firefighting mode.  Been centering whole company on Jason; I am a hit all the bases tech partner that can up your game.
	- thing you cannot get back is time.  Investor money is going to be taht much harder to get.  
	- first interaction of your first product.  now we imagine it working all the way to A-but things will change.  you need a partner for these shifts.
	- You may feel you are in execution groove, but reality will be different.


consultative Dan:

formal by end of year
- awesome, I have enjoyed discussons and strategizing (its been fruitful), we have been want to do this for three years, so lets just do this.
- I know you offered $300K, but having $200K and capped equity significantly de-risks things for you and the company... I love to get working on execution and strategy ASAP.  What do you think  so what do you think?  Can we formalize this before end of year?
- 
- we talked about $300K, given funding risks I do think $200K makes sense and a the environment I am happy to have that be $200K.  I am happy to accept a cap.  What does it take to just get started.

hey do you want to work to

- Its a lull but 2023 is going to 

- GRZ;

- Been in firefighting mode.  Been centering whole company on Jason; I am a hit all the bases tech partner that can up your game.
	- thing you cannot get back is time.  Investor money is going to be taht much harder to get.  
	- first interaction of your first product.  now we imagine it working all the way to A-but things will change.  you need a partner for these shifts.
	- You may feel you are in execution groove, but reality will be different.
	- Did you create the company:  In order to be executing.  and neck deep in technical.
	- It speed to market.
	- Need to unpack the current situation
- Can we get something on paper before end of year.
- What are you unsure about?
- Lets try it out 

- What is your Super power?    :  Your super power is driving vision and external leading of company, not tech strategy 
ok, if not co-founder then what do you need?

- have you missed opportunities to get into market?
	- Has team delivered expected in ideal time frames?
- Do you have someone who can really OWN all internal aspects?

- 

   So how do we move forward?  Do you think we will be able to put a concrete plan in place before end of year?

Need higher intesity across whole team - market is going to kill many company, lets not be one!
