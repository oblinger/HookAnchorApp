## EDU CORP WHITE PAPER NOTES

## EDU CORP SUPPLEMENT NOTES


## FORWARDISM


FIRST SELF-DRIVING MODEL OF POST CAPITALISM
- Dollars Drive Capitalism - Capital enlists and leverages labor for maximal profit back to capital and minimal benefit back to labor.  (This is the STATED objective of a corporation!)
- Network of People Drive Edu Corp - x Stated objective of the network is to spread benefit to as many as possible, and minimize individual failures from the network.


## EDU CORP DESIGN DOC


The essence of the Edu Corp model is finely balanced set of contractual terms, cultural norms, and incentives that 50 ways to Tuesday aim to produce constructive behavior over the enormously wide range of circumstances these businesses will face.

This is INCREDIBLY COMPLEX to get right.  It is very hard to even think about all the possible futures, possible progression of reality, possible risk reward tradeoffs and then think about all the many ways each individual might be tempted to “game” the system for personal ends at the expense of the goals of others and of the larger system itself.

In this section we argue for the choices made in the Edu Corp model and consider the consequences and alternatives for the Edu Corp model.  This section is hard to think about, it gets abstract, and honestly it does not need to really be considered or understood by those joining or running Edu Corp.  They are the considerations that lead to the choices built into the Edu Corp model.  So, feel free to skip this section if that is not your interest.

… Yet to be written …

·    Individual Loans – People make decisions on an individual-by-individual basis.  Thus it is critical that the loans you sign and co-sign are signed by you and you alone.  This means student in a failing corp can

·    Co-Signing Forward Loan – Attaching the correct dollar figure to the co-signing forward loan ensures that the upper class correctly balance the need for the Edu Corp pyramid to take risks on underclass students against the need to safeguard investor money from being squandered on individuals or sub-corporations that for one reason or another are at a high risk of failing.  Setting this figure properly will ensure the upper class person, in the _same business_ with, and having _intimate knowledge_ of the individual in question is incentivsed to make the optimal decision with the precious investor dollars wall street has given Edu Corp.

·    Forward Loan Adjustment – over time the central non-profit will gain insight into each kind of business and the associated business and personal risks associated with these new corporations.  It can provide this information to the upper class making these decisions, and it can adjust the forward loan amounts up or down to discourage or encourage riskier loan underwriting.

·    Bottoms Up – But ultimate the loan decision is a very bottoms up decision.  It rests with those upper class persons with greatest knowledge and greatest incentvies to make the right choice.

·     

·    Juggling Corporate Bowling Balls – Half of the freshmen who join will first buy the WHOLE school from the upper class only to then turn around and sell the whole school to their junior class before buying their own business.  One the face of it this seems a bit crazy.  Why doesn’t the central non-profit just own these schools, or why don’t.

·    Early commit – Edu co

·     

·    Junior cohort pair – All Loan & asset negotiations are managed by the two junior cohorts during the period before they have made their final decision about which cohort will become the senior at the school, and which will immediately form a corporation.

·    Corporate jujitsu – In theory, theoretical models are simple, in practice they aren’t!  These are for-profit businesses that require significant capital, require significant assets, and crucially depend on many intangible assets like ongoing supplier or customer relations, among hundreds of other details.   Providing fair costs and compensations for the different risks and situations faced by each class in each new situation will be incredibly nuanced and situation dependent.  There is no way to prescribe how things should proceed, or how monies should flow, etc.  Fortunately we don’t need to!  We have arranged incentives so that the junior cohorts have balanced

## PROCESS TWEAKS

### THE EDU CORP ANCILLARY-SERVICES TOOLBOX

**THE PROBLEM** - There are a great number of skills required for any one business.  Most of Edu Corp's training is focused on the core skills and capabilities required to perform the business itself.  Beyond these skills, however, there are many dozens of other speciality skill capabilities, from the one-off construction of a green house, the legal services required in forming/operating the business, to the month end accounting required for each business.  It will be too much for new entrepreneurs to acquire all of these skills in order to operate their business.  Instead Central builds a blueprint for each business type where it proposes a combination of the four tools listed here to fully cover supply each of these ancillary services to the templated businesses in a way that maximizes the tradeoffs that exist around each required skill capacity.  These four approaches should be viewed as tools in Central's tool box, allowing it to design the template business type in the most cost effective ways, and with optimized incentive alignments between each of the participants within the larger web of constructed businesses.

FOUR TOOLS IN OUR BUSINESS TEMPLATE CONSTRUCTION TOOLBOX
	1. Centrally provided services
	2. Cohort specialist services
	3. Student-consultant services
	4. Tandem sub-business services


**CENTRALLY PROVIDED SERVICES SOLUTION** - This tool is appropriate for skills that:
	(1) require very high levels of training and expertise and cannot be learned in a modest period of time, and
	(2) are only sporadically needed such that purchasing them externally or providing them for free will not represent an unsustainable cost.  
	In these cases the central non-profit can have internal staff or external consultants provide these services to the schools and businesses either as a free benefit, or as a paid service as needed.  
- CORPORATE LAWYER/ACCOUNTING EXAMPLE - Each corporation will need to have legal representation that is well versed in local corporate law.  This could be provided as a combination of free corporation templates specialized for each type of business, along with a small number of free consulting hours to look over final docs, plus paid hourly support for specialized per-business work as required for each new business.  Central is able to negotiate better rates since it is promising a steady stream of work, and because everything is constructed around templates shared across many businesses, the hours required by the expert familiar with these templates will be greatly reduced on a per-corporation basis.
- ANCILLARY SERVICE EXAMPLES - Other services, like building websites, providing marketing services, etc can all be handled by getting reduced rates from select vendors for in return for a steady stream of business.
- BENEFIT - Having a trusted supplier for these services will greatly lighten the initial complexity of starting a new business, and reduces the chances of making poor choices which could greatly damage the business.  At the same time, the sporadic nature of these services likely means many of the experts in the business of providing these services will spend significant effort in sales and marketing in order to get a steady supply of work.  This means that Central is in a great position to negotiate for rock bottom pricing from skilled professionals in return for a steady supply of hassle-free work for them.


**THE COHORT SPECIALIST SOLUTION** - Is appropriate for skills that:
	(1) are frequently needed on an on going basis, but 
	(2) are not the main activity of the business, and 
	(3) are trainable within the standard period of the schools regular training.  
	In this case Central can offer specialized classes and training for one or two selected individuals within each cohort.  
- MONTHLY ACCOUNTING EXPERT EXAMPLE - Businesses are likely going to still need to get professional end of year accounting in order to file with the government correctly, etc.  Still great savings are reaped, if the day to day and month end accounting is performed by a member of the corporation.  To that end, one member of each cohort is selected to become trained and eventually perform this regular activity.
- PAYMENTS & FORWARD LOANS - Since these selected individuals are part of the corporation for which they serve it is possible, but not required that they would be paid by the corporation for this work.  If the training itself was expensive, then it might be appropriate to tie a modest forward loan to their execution of this duty for some defined period of time.
- BENEFIT:  Cohort specialists are employees of the business, so this approach is quite cost effective since optional payments will stay within the corporation's employees.  Also by explicitly choosing one or two cohort members it ensures that each business has two or four of its employees with this require skill while not bothering the majority of the students with this more ancillary training.


**THE STUDENT CONSULTANT SOLUTION** - For skills that:
	(1) are trainable within a modest period of time, 
	(2) are only needed too sporadically by each business to justify training a cohort specialist, but
	(3) are still needed often enough that the ongoing costs of paying centrally provided external experts would add up. 
	In this case, Central can train a special cadre of consultants from exceptional students within *all* of the incoming classes.
- INTERNSHIP - Central will offer special internships to selected students to cover these occasionally used skills.  The student that accepts the internship will then be required to train with the original instructor experts, operating first as an assistant, and finally as the expert themselves.  This will be a 'side business' for these selected students in addition  to their regular duties within their corporation.
- CONSULTANT - Once trained they will be paid by each corp that they help out with a certain number of future corporations.  Their cohort must accept this extra responsibility (and might take a cut of the income too depending on how disruptive it was to their expected work) 
- FORWARD LOAN - Each internship will come with a special forward loan, if the student later choose to stop executing the responsibility they would pay a pro-rated forward loan that covers the cost of training an new consultant before the full period is complete.
- GREEN HOUSE CONSTRUCTION EXAMPLE - The construction of a green house from raw materials is not a regularly needed skill in running a green house, but it is a non-trivial skill to acquire, and having even one expert on hand during construction means that the green house is constructed much faster and much better.
  In this case, a small number of individual students are selected to deeply learn this skill from the original business instructors.  They agree they will be on hand to help during construction of many green houses (not just for their business), eventually they will be paid as support and eventually as the lead expert, and will come to be the paid expert for up to 10 years or 100 green houses in order to fulfill their duty in this side job.  (If they want to escape this contract before it is up, they will pay a pro-rated forward loan for the education they received instead of serving their whole term.)
- BENEFIT - This approach is less burdensome than a cohort specialist, and it also can work in cases where the trained skill is hard to learn, since we can pick and choose the very most apt students for the training.  Finally it can be as cost effective as the cohort specialist approach since it is still student labor that is being paid for.


**THE TANDEM SUB-BUSINESS SOLUTION** - Certain "difficult" skill capabilities are too expensive and required too often for them to be a "Centrally Provided Solution".  At the same time they are 'difficult' in some way so that the consultant or cohort specialist approaches also fail.  These might capacities are difficult because of some combination these needs:  They: 
	(1) require a heavy investment of time to acquire the skills, and/or 
	(2) require expensive assets to accomplish, and/or 
	(3) require  economies of scale that are only achieved when amortized over many corporations, and/or 
	(4) require a whole team of individuals rather than a single individual to provide this capacity.  
	In these difficult cases the central non-profit structures a specialty sub-business which will operate in tandem with multiple of the core businesses that it serves.
	In some cases these tandem relationships will require contractual and financial linkages in order to spread the risks and align the incentives between these tandem businesses.  But in all cases these separate corporations will be free to make their own decisions subject to the formalized incentive alignment built into their formation.
- SHARED TRANSPORT EXAMPLE - Consider the catch-22 situation where a farming business is only profitable if there is an affordable/reliable transport to some central market place.  But the only way for such a transport business to be affordable is for it to be serving the transport needs of many farms.  If those farms don't yet exist, then there is a high risk in setting up this transport business since its high cost outlays could could overwhelm their income stream for years causing the business to fail long before it is profitable.  But w/o a pre-existing transport business no farm is built.
- APPROACH - In this case, Central creates a new corp billet for a speciality transport business.  This business can be partially owned across many corporations, or could be directly owned by the students that own/run this speciality business.  In either case, the risks of the loans required for this business are tied to the future execution of other farming businesses which don't exist yet.  To make this work each of those farm corps that require this transport will need to co-sign for part of the loan for this transportation business.  Further to avoid price gouging and price stability these businesses will need to pay enough for there transport to cover the operating costs of the transport business plus their loans plus an amount of money that matches the take home salary of the transport workers with the take home salary of the operators of each farm (so each farm will pay a little different price for their transport).  This arrangement will only hold constant during the payback period.  After that there will be some number of months or years where the price controls are gradually removed.  During this relaxation period, Central encourages both sides to negotiate forward looking contracts in order to ensure long term reliability is maintained.  At the same time, since the legal restrictions are being removed, it allows the free market to properly set pricing.  Ultimately it also leaves both farms and transporters the option to choose alternate partners or businesses as they see fit.
- BENEFITS - This approach (1) greatly reduces the capital risks around the specialty sub-business since it has a captive customer base, and it (2) greatly increases the reliability and cost effectiveness of the sub-businesses services since they are contracted and required to perform this work for the farms, and because their pricing is controlled to match the fortunes or famines that beset the farms themselves.  Independent businesses by contrast would be far riskier since they could not control or predict their customer loan, and they could easily gouge those same customers since each one of them is absolutely dependent upon their transportation.  This approach mitigates both of these negative common negative outcomes.



TOOL CHOICE CHART
- Is skill so sporadic that business can just pay external experts for it?    --->  use a Centrally Provided Service
- Is the capacity 'difficult' skill to provide?                                                  --->   use a Tandem Business
- Is the skill needed frequently and easily trained?                                    --->   use a Cohort Specialist 
- The skill is moderate, not easily trained, but also not difficult, OR
	its usage is moderate, not too frequent, and not rare                        --->  use a Student Consultant

### 2023-07-11  Collette pointers

What you are describing makes me think of the Kennedy School.  I don’t know that I have something super particular to offer, though can offer some leads:

-          Check out social impact bonds.  I think they have to have very good and tight rubrics, and what you described briefly seems to be in a similar vein.

-          Skim the table of contents of Harvard Magazine online.  Not every issue reports on a project like you are describing, but periodically they do, and when they do it is often a very good project with quantified outcomes.  

-          Skim Harvard Kennedy School alumni magazines online.  The articles are shorter, but probably more often closer to what you are looking for. These could give you leads for learning more.

-          Also, look for any sort of related efforts (successful or not) and how strengths and weaknesses were evaluated.

XXXX:

I didn't want to take over Kian's nice birthday party with my naive questions 
still seems being a CFO for a non-profit focused on providing alternative funding for new businesses you are amazingly well place to throw enlightening cold water on my nacent thinking.

Even in 

-- I was surprised to learn that loan failure was not a large issue with these alternate loans.  I wonder if that is genaerlly true.  Even if the loan amounts required become larger does this remain mostly a non-issue?  Also I wonder if one needs to be overly conservative in order to keep failure rates low.  That is, if one had significantly greater personal knowlege about the recipient, could one safely offer loans to a much larger set of recipients?  Any thought on that?

-- SIGNIFICANT TRAINING -- Jobs that require significant training can be problematic since one may not get a job after the training.  This limits the recipients desire to take the risk in time and money, and it increase the loan failure rate.  With EduCorp you are guaranteed a job, since you are joining a functioning business, and when you sign a loan you immediately a starting the business in which you are a part owner.  The job risk is replace by a business failure risk, but the business failure risk is reduced by having a sister business.

-- NETWORK --  Jobs with significant network effects can be helped by having successful businesses co-signing your loan.

-- BRAND --  Group of businesses form a natural informal or formal brand.

NEXT:  
- He would send info on two case studies.
- He would connect me to his contact at USAID, and MOFA



FOLLOWUP EMAIL


Moses, 

This was such a good meeting!  Thanks.  It is quite surprising how closely your knowledge and experience matches this idea.  It is a very auspicious connection!  It is far too early to understand how things might be connected together, still I can see how this kind of a system could work well with an international center in Ghana, it is an idea to keep in mind.

  

You asked me for a list of next step items just to keep these efforts organized.  We actually mentioned a pretty big list of items like the framework for analyzing potential businesses etc.  Rather that create such a large list right now, I will keep this focused on immediate actions.  Here are two items:

- Business info for green house farming and for agricultural product transportation 

- Introductions at US-aid and MOFA

  

  

BUSINESS CASES

Even before you make any introductions at US-aid or MOFA, I think it will be quite valuable to try to paint a very basic picture of how this system might work in the case of an actual business.  I thought about the different cases we discussed, and it occurs to me two business types stand out:

  

- GREEN HOUSE FARMING - As you mentioned such businesses are easier to fund since they are more reliable, and I expect that there is notable skill and cash needed to setup a green house and then maximize every square meter of its output for maximum profit.  I bet this is an area where cash and training can have large value.  I also bet this is a business where it would be reasonable to create a 20 or 100 person shared corp - I think the size of the business might be good.  

  At this stage it would be super useful to have ANY kinds of numbers about what the setup costs would be, and what kind of revenue was plausible.  I am not trying to build the actual business case here; rather I would just love to have some “somewhat" real numbers in a simple table so that when I speak about this idea I have at least one business where I have very basic numbers that show the idea at least has potential.

  

- AGRI-BUSINESS TRANSPORTATION - This idea which we began with has the virtue of being more easily analyzed and paid back since it is a pretty simple business.  Thus having basic numbers for a specific case (like Coconut transportation near a particular city) would lend some credibility to the presentation.

  I know it will take alot of work to get real numbers for either of these, I am hoping there is some easy starting point that I might integrate into my thinking even before I discuss these ideas with others.

  

  

INTRODUCTIONS

My thought is that as soon as I have any initial info you might have easy access to, I could then connect with your contacts, perhaps to have that three way call if they have the interest.

  

  

  

I look forward to future discussions.  Thanks much for such a good call.

  

Regards,

--Dan




### t2022-06-25  Transcript

#### Title
- Exponential Edu Corp.  Using one's future success to obtain the connections cash and training needed to achieve that success. 

#### Problem
- What problem are we solving?  The disadvantaged need what the rich already have, the connections, cash, and training to succeed.
- Simply giving loaning money fails.  The set up and the incentives are all wrong.
- Nobody's in the trenches with you.  Unlike the rich uncle with a business, your competitors are not trying help you, but rather to beat you!
- Opportunities are squandered because they're not earned.
- Loan officers lacked local knowledge; loans aren't paid back because it is to some nameless third person
- Resources aren't cared for because they're not owned.
- Nobody has enthusiasm because they don't even know if a job will exist for them when done.
- And whole system is not scalable since even if against all odds someone succeeds, that success does not drive future successes for others.
- UGH!   Edu Corp has a contractually-mandated "pay it forward" mechanism that solves ALL of these problems.  Ok, so how?

#### Vocational School
- VOC SCHOOL - It's a vocational school that's owned by the senior cohort of students.  And there are 2 junior and 2 freshman cohorts too.
- ITS A RUNNING BUSINESS - The school is organized around a running business, it employs ***peer-to-peer*** apprenticeship teaching, along with online video material.
- JUNIORS - On graduation day, the junior cohorts ***sign loans*** to form a new corporation and to buy the school the senior cohort.  And the cohorts split -- One cohort becomes the seniors at the school and the other joins the new business.
- RECRUIT - The newly ranking seniors then must recruit two freshman cohorts to rebuilt the school, and this process is repeated as a way of pumping out a stream no newly form businesses.
- RESOURCES - Notice that the resources are protected because they're owned by the senior cohort who bought it with their loans, and can only sell it onward if in good condition.
- JOB - You are guaranteed a job because you are a part owner of the company that you will work for.
- SCALES - And its scales indefinitely since each corporation is bought using its future income.

Lets let's talk for a moment about those graduation day loans ...

#### Secret Sauce
- SECRET SAUCE - Incentive alignment is the secret sauce of Edu Corp.   It allows decision making to be driven down to the level of those with boots on the ground in a way that I think is magic and I think novel too.
- Here are the two Junior class cohorts one will cosign in order to buy the school from the seniors, while the other is cosigning in order to split a create a business with the seniors.  
- BLIND SPLIT - By the way, they don't know which is which, so they're actually negotiating the terms of the split without knowing which cohort is going in which direction.  This is important because it can be complicated, maybe the business is going to get a head start by taking a few clients from the school maybe it'll take an old tractor with it so they're going to negotiate how these details are split apart, and how things get paid for.

- FIVE CO-SIGNERS - Each person needs to have five cosigners, one inside their own cohort and four from upper class cohorts.  This is really important:  
	- CASH FLOW POSITIVE - Much stronger than a micro loan since the parent business owners must be cash flow positive before the loan is approved, so their co-signing guarantee will have significance.
	- BEST LOAN OFFICER - And these upper class persons are the best possible loan officer, they know the student and the local business context better than any loan officer, and their PERSONAL cash is on the line.  They will only sign up for a good bet!
	- ALIGNED - Notice also once they do sign, they really have your back.  They will pay extra attention that you are not falling thru the cracks during training.  They are in the trenches with you.

The Roles:
- The seniors are focused on running the school, teaching the underclasses.
- The juniors are focused on splitting things up finding a location for the new business and setting everything up, and 
	- Notice the flexibility in this loan structuring; every new business situation is going to be unique in someways but if the business case is strong, the upper class persons will co-sign.
- Upper class must have under class they have agreed to co-sign before they are allow to graduate, and Freshmen cannot progress until they have 5 co-signer who are tentatively committing to signing the future graduation day loan.
	- This system provides very powerful and very personal mentoring within the system, you have your cohort and you have your co-signers, both win when you win, and loose when you loose.
	- After many months of tireless help, you will not want to let them down.  
	- It is also a reality check, if you cannot get upper class people to tentatively agree to co-sign your future graduation day loans, you cannot progress to be a Junior, you are asked to leave and a replacement must be found.
	  It is warning sign that interpersonal trust is not there, and/or trusting you with a large loan and share of a business could be problematic.  

But what requires any upperclass person to agree to co-sign anyone?  The Central Non-Profit.



THE CENTRAL NON-PROFIT
- The schools and businesses that have not yet paid off their loans are actually a student-owned franchise of a non-profit called "Central"
- It's the trusted 3rd party ensuring everyone plays by the rules.
	- It's trusted because it has no skin in the game, it owns nothing, takes no risks, and get no profits.
- It provides "Adult" supervision.
	- Ensures contractual obligations are honored, and more generally just keeps things running smoothly and honestly.
	- If you think about it we're taking a group of strangers who have never owned a business, or indeed may never have had a real job before, have them all sign multi-year loans for expensive equipment all in their name...what could possibly go wrong???  Oh my God all kinds of things can go wrong!  One student leaves town with two months of accounts receivable, poor business choices, not paying back loans, etc.  
	- So central controls key bank accounts, accounts receivable, etc.  Until loans are paid off.
	- It also provides legal, accounting, and business training and services.
	- It provides the training wheels for these businesses until they have experience themselves.

Central's other key function is control.
- Every exponential system is like a cancer, left on its own these schools would keep producing businesses until there's so many businesses that all of them fail because they've saturated the market.
- That's no good so the central nonprofit continuously monitors each marketplace within each Geo and each client nation, to assess how many more businesses can be supported.  
- Based on this they create a number of "billets" that exactly matches the number of schools, that correctly modulate the whole system.
- In the example shown here, Central wants ramp up purple businesses, ramp down green, and start a new yellow kind of business.  
- So they create five "billets":  continue purple, continue purple, double purple, close green, and switch to yellow.
- The schools choose the one they want, if two schools want the same billet, then a zero sum payment is attached which will flow to other schools over a fix period of time.  These payments are adjusted until each billet is wanted by exactly one school.
- In this way everybody is fairly compensated for the difficulty or easiness of what they're doing to 'pay it forward'  
- Again the system incentives, but then lets those with boots on the ground make the right choices, so if one school has charismatic leadership, in a good position to recruit and later help new businesses find business, then they can take on the risk of creating a second school with more recruited students -- and they get paid big time for the extra work and risk.
- Same for simply converting your school into a business vs. creating a NEW kind of school, or starting the same school in a new country, and learning how to do the new tasks with your under class persons.  Much higher risks, so you are paid for it.
- Notice: there's no specific timetable for when graduation day happens.  Each school is a business, and it can run as one.  But if it struggles to get customers and it can't recruit new students very well then it must wait until all conditions are met for its new corp loan.  While another school might be lined up to recruit students and customers like crazy, boom, boom, boom, so it is turning out corporations like nobody's business.  And this is just how we want it, marginal schools with marginal ability to grow customers are more likely to create failing businesses so that part of the tree slows down, letting others parts grab students and customers.  In this way most all corporations naturally have high performing parents because the way the tree grows.

The last piece of the puzzle are the FORWARD loans.
- The whole Edu Corps idea is to 'pay it forward' -- but what stops me from getting my corp and then just never co-signing or helping others?  The "Forward" loan.
	- This loan is also signed on graduation day, but it is 'optionally' paid instead of completing your paying-it-forward commitment
	- What is all your underclass are bozos, and you think the businesses will fail.  We don't WANT you to co-sign that loan!  We want you to use your best judgement.  
	- But we need to put appropriate incentive in place, so you will take some modest risk in co-signing.  Indeed by setting the forward loan size, Central is able to carefully control the levels of risk it is asking for.
	- There are also Forward loans the entire school can pay if it decides it cannot follow thru on the billet it selected.  Maybe there is a bad recession, and now starting a business is a bad idea.
	  Fine, you can pay-it-forward with a loan amount, instead of a new corporation.  Accurate setting of forward loan sizes ensures that everyone is incentivized to 'pay-it-forward' but also with a safety valve if that is not longer a smart move.

WHAT'S THE CATCH
- So what's the catch?  This all sounds too amazing so gotta be a catch in there somewhere.  There are two:
- It takes a special kind person.of stupid I mean this is kind you need somebody who is motivated ambitious also going to wash out the system so you need to have people like that in modern ambitious people they can succeed in lots of circumstances so why sign up for this thing and an obligate yourself to pay it forward when you can just go to your rich uncle and just get it done what you want so I need ambitious people without options I think such people exist but I need them I need a special kind of business possible if I do magically give you the connections in the cash in the training I boost your profitability so much you can repay all the loans I needed to give you that cash and training so that the system works and needs to be repeatable I need to be able to couples are adaptable template that I can turn out many businesses maybe they serve different nationalities maybe they are located in different Geos maybe they are doing different crops but they need to have some commonality that the system can be built around it so I think this really is the catch that needs to be understood and it's really why I want to talk with you

### m2014-06-02 Random meeting notes

- type of buisness:
  "one" person buisness -- e.g. selling solar power for lighting.  or phone service. etc.


- idea from Stephanie (german) 2014-06-02 play game w. 15 different types of people to
  see how it works.
  - each human plays ten people, each in a distinct starting position (e.g. has working business)


- System are inefficient because middle men have power and individuals

- Access to banks  -- so they buy cattle
