21day * 4hours * 30bets/hr * .07 = $176.4   estimated total cost thru 2015/01
30bets/hr * .07/bet = $2.10


====
If I made 1,000 $5 bets.  I would have spent $5 * 1000 and have won $5 * 2 * 493wins =  $5 * -14 = -$70 for 1000 bets.
This is 7 cents per bet.
Precise odds of winning pass line bet:  244/495.    (1-244/495*2) * $5 = 7.0707... cents
