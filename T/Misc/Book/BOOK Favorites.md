## Directions

### Other Genres

Below are books I have loved, I would like to get some non-sci-fi books in other genres that I might like, first suggest genres I might like, and why? 

### Standard

The books listed below are favorites of mine.  Please suggest other books I might like to read.  In general I like:
- Hard science fiction books involving stories built around novel concepts. 
- Also books across other genres that involve novel concepts are of interest.
- I enjoy shorter books that teach something about our world or society (like Guns Germs and Steel).
- Books from other genres that are loved by folks like me


## BOOKS ABOUT SOCIETY THAT I HAVE LOVED INCLUDE:

"Guns, Germs, and Steel" by Jared Diamond
Although not a science book per se, it offers a thought-provoking analysis of the factors that have shaped human history.

"Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley

"1984" by George Orwell

"Sophie's World" by Jostein Gaarder
This novel doubles as a guide to philosophy, exploring major philosophical ideas and thinkers.


MY FAVORITE SCIFI BOOKS INCLUDE

"The Three-Body Problem", "The Dark Forest" by Liu Cixin

"Enders Game" by Doug Eagen

"A Desolation Called Peace", and 
"A Memory Called Empire", by Arkady Martine
- Because of the epic nature of the society it describes, and for the subtlety in the society that it paints for us.

"Diaspora" and "Permutation City" by Greg Egan

"A Fire Upon the Deep", and
"Deepness in the Sky" (Zones of Thought series) by Vernor Vinge

"Uplift War", "Startide Rising" by David Brin

"Daemon", "Freedom" by Daniel Suarez

"Singularity Sky" by Charles Stross

"For We are Many" by Dennis Taylor

"The Left Hand of Darkness" by Ursula Le Guin

"The Quantum Thief" by Hannu Rajaniemi.
- the book had so many novel ideas

OTHER GOOD SCIFI BOOKS INCLUDE

"Dune" by Frank Herbert

"Hyperion" by Dan Simmons

"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" by Robert A. Heinlein

"House of Suns" by Alistar Renolds

"The Forever War", "Old Man's War" by John Scalzi

"Blackwing War" 

"Anathem" by Neal Stephenson

"Ancillary Justice" "Provenance"  by Ann Leckie

"Flowers For Algernon" by Daniel Keyes

"Contact" by Carl Sagan

"Ringworld", "Integral Trees" by Larry Niven

"Incandescence" by Greg Egan
- Novel plot regarding race that was cut off, and another that was a "sleepwalking" super intelligence
- Novel ideas about extremely long lived people and races.
- Story was a bit slow because of its very detailed consideration of experimental setups and results.

"Roadside Picnic"
- It's an awesome setup for a novel context and a novel take on humans' first brush with aliens.
- Still, the story did not go anywhere.  Many questions and outcomes were left unresolved.

. **"Pandora's Star" (and its sequel "Judas Unchained")**: 

Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas Hofstadter

Rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke
- good but too slow

The Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin
 A profound exploration of societal structures and the interplay between utopian ideals and anarchistic realities.


BOOKS THAT TAUGHT ME SOMETHING

"Sophie's World"
Was great.  I found the story of sophie and this mysterious teacher to be engaging, and at the same time I really LOVED being taught so many major philosophical schools of thought in such a summarizing fashion.  I would eagerly read any other book that both taught and engaged in a similar way.

BOOKS THAT WERE JUST OK

"The Expanse" Series by James S.A. Corey
I loved the society described and the concept of the proto-molecule, but the story had big plot holes that were frustrating.

Begins with _"Leviathan Wakes,"_ this series blends space opera with hard science and complex political and societal themes, focusing on humanity's expansion into space.

"Solaris" by Stanislaw Lem
