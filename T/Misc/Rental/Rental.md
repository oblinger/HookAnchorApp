Garage Parking Spot For Rent

I have a parking spot I'm offering on a per month basis at 3403 Cesar
Chavez Avenue (at mission street). The unit is enclosed (garage) and
can fit an SUV or other large vehicle. It is a shared garage unit.

=== HOUSE

Spacious and Clean Master bedroom suite right in the Mission.

The whole apartment is a great warm space.  A large shared garden and patio on the way in, big living room, high ceilings, 
clean textured walls ceilings... lot of light.  A pretty sweet place.

Much of my stuff has not caught up with me yet (it is in storage lockers in DC) so the place is pretty sparse right now.
I have a few peices of furniture in the living room, a huge mirror and sweet dresser in your bedroom, and just the basics in the kitchen
and bathroom.

We are in the middle of it all here.  a block off of Valencia -- the main drag thru the mission, are 2 block from bart, and two bus line stop at our corner.

THE APARTMENT:
I have a great two bedroom apartment with the larger bedroom (15x10) for rent. The bedroom has a huge closet down one entire wall of the room. The apartment itself is clean with tile kitchen floors and nicely painted textured walls. The apartment gets lots of light, and is quite spacious. I have a friendly, clean, non-invasive cat. Most of my stuff is still on its way from the east coast, so while your room is nicely furnished with mirror, dresser, and full sized bed, the apartment itself is sparsely appointed. 

ABOUT ME: 
I am the CTO for a funded startup in Mountain View, so I will spend a large fraction of the week away from home. I am a professional, very clean, no-drama, no-drugs, and looking for the same. I am easy going and an extrovert -- quite possible we end up friends. Still I am primarily looking for a roommate not a best friend here. I am white/straight, but enjoy diversity in orientations, genders, races and cultures, so all are very welcome.

THE LOCATION: 
We are 2.5 blocks from BART and have two muni stops right on our corner, so it is ideal for transportation, and being one block from the south part of mission and one block off of Valencia means there are many very good restaurants, and some modestly prices restaurants very close. 

If interested let me know and tell me about you.
Thank you.

====================


I am Jamie's roomate.  The guy taking over the lease in November.
I would like to give a call to see about your staying here.  My number is 415.494.9499

About me:  I am the CTO for a small startup in Mountain View, so I bounce between SF and MV
all the time.  I am relatively new to SF, so I am building up my circle of here -- that 
said, I am often out and about.  I am tidy and would want the public spaces to stay that way.
I am non-smoking/no-drugs but not pretty flexible about what you are.

The Place:  It is big, and it is clean, and well maintained.  For me it is wonderful to come home to.
The neighbors have a BBQ every other week on our shared patio space, and we also have a roof access too.
Most of my stuff is still in DC, so it is also sparse too.
I have a friendly cat, he is based in my room, but will be out to greet you when you come home.


I will call, or you can call me.

Cheers,

Hi Jamie,
 
We can make a change, but the replacement roommate would need to be checked out with the normal process.  You can refer them to the Apply to Rent page on our website, and have them follow the instructions.  They need to pay the credit check fee as well as a $50 charge to do all the paperwork to make the change official (it is a bit of work).
 
There is no sense in a walkthrough on our part unless the property is being totally vacated; it simply has no purpose.  We do not make deposit refunds unless the unit is vacated (all tenants move out).
 
If you have further questions, call me, but otherwise, let us know what is happening with the roommate change.
 
PS:  Can you tell me who is primarily responsible for the items out on the common deck area?  It is a bit overboard, and cluttered, and owner wants something done about it.
