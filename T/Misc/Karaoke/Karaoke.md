FRIENDS IN LOW PLACES    http://open.spotify.com/track/0rvi0RqG8q08dx0YwfElh0

Blame it all on my roots,
I showed up in boots,
And ruined your black tie affair.

The last one to know,
The last one to show,
I was the last one you tought you'd see there.

And I saw a surprise,
And the fear in his eyes,
When I took his glass of champange,

I toasted you,
Said honey we may be through,
But you'll never hear me complain,

(Chorus)
'Cause I got friends in low places,
Where the Whiskey drowns,
And the Beer chases my blues away,
But I'll be okay,
Now I'm not big on social graces,
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis,
Oh I got friends,
In low places.

I guess I was wrong I just don't belong
but then I've been there before, everything's alright
I'll just say goodnight and I'll show myself to the door
Hey I didn't mean to cause a big scene just give me an 
hour and then, I'll be as high as that Ivory Tower and you'll
never know,

Chorus 

I guess I was wrong I just don't belong
but then I've been there before, everythings alright
I'll just say goodnight and I'll show myself to the door
Hey I didn't mean to cause a big scene just wait 'til I finish this glass
Then, sweet little lady I'll head back to the bar (haha) and you can kiss my ass

Chorus

Grandma's Feather Bed  -- John Denver -- http://open.spotify.com/track/4i11gpoRjvwxckBJS9HkjA

When I was a little bitty boy
Just up off-a floor
We used to go down to Grandma's house
Every month end or so
We had chicken pie and country ham
And homemade butter on the bread
But the best darn thing about Grandma's house
Was her great big feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids, four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On Grandma's feather bed

After the supper we'd sit around the fire
The old folks'd spit and chew
Pa would talk about the farm and the war
And Granny'd sing a ballad or two
I'd sit and listen and watch the fire
Till the cobwebs filled my head
Next thing I knew I'd wake up in the morning
In the middle of the old feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids, four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On Grandma's feather bed

Well I love my Ma, an' I love my Pa
Love Granny and Grandpa too
Been fishing with my uncle, I wrestled with my cousin
I even kissed Aunt Lou oooh
But if ever had to make a choice
I guess it ought to be said
That I'd trade them all plus the gal down the road
For Grandma's feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids, four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On Grandma's feather bed

A Boy Name Sue         -- Johnny Cash    http://open.spotify.com/track/60uylQNEtDF7joppzetZIE

"A Boy Named Sue"

My daddy left home when I was three 
And he didn't leave much to ma and me 
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze. 
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid 
But the meanest thing that he ever did 
Was before he left, he went and named me "Sue." 

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke 
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk, 
It seems I had to fight my whole life through. 
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red 
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head, 
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named "Sue." 

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean, 
My fist got hard and my wits got keen, 
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame. 
But I made a vow to the moon and stars 
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars 
And kill that man who gave me that awful name. 

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July 
And I just hit town and my throat was dry, 
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew. 
At an old saloon on a street of mud, 
There at a table, dealing stud, 
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me "Sue." 

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad 
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had, 
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye. 
He was big and bent and gray and old, 
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold 
And I said: "My name is 'Sue!' How do you do! 
Now your gonna die!!" 

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes 
And he went down, but to my surprise, 
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear. 
But I busted a chair right across his teeth 
And we crashed through the wall and into the street 
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer. 

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men 
But I really can't remember when, 
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile. 
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss, 
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first, 
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile. 

And he said: "Son, this world is rough 
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough 
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along. 
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye 
I knew you'd have to get tough or die 
And it's the name that helped to make you strong." 

He said: "Now you just fought one hell of a fight 
And I know you hate me, and you got the right 
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do. 
But ya ought to thank me, before I die, 
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye 
Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you "Sue.'" 

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun 
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son, 
And I came away with a different point of view. 
And I think about him, now and then, 
Every time I try and every time I win, 
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him 
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!

Freedom

If you feel like dancing                    
In the middle of the street

Breaking into song
Or singing out of key
And if you fall in love 
Go on and kiss that girl or boy
And if you like your music loud
Make a little noise

When you let it go
What they say is true
When you let it go
It'll come right back to you

When you let it go
There is freedom when you do
When you let it go
It'll come right back to you

Every time now
La La La La La
Everybody sing
La La La La La

If something's on your mind
Say what you need to say
And if you need to make a change
Go on and walk away
If something's in your heart
You gotta let it out
Go on and show the whole wide world
What you are all about

When you let it go
What they say is true
When you let it go
It'll come right back to you

When you let it go
There is freedom when you do
When you let it go
It'll come right back to you

Every time now
La La La La La
Everybody sing
La La La La La

CAKE -- The distance

Reluctantly crouched at the starting line,
Engines pumping and thumping in time.
The green light flashes, the flags goes up,
Churning and burning, they yern for the cup.

They deftly manouver and muscle for rank,
Fuel burning fast on an empty tank,
Wreckless and wild they pour thru the turns,
Their prowless is podent and secretly stern.

As they speed thru the finish the flags go down.
The fans get up, and get out of town.
The arena is empty except for one man,
Still driving and striving as fast as he can

The sun has gone down and the moon has come up,
And long ago somebody left with the cup,
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns,
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns.

He's going the distance.
He's going for speed.
She's all alone, all alone in her time of need.

Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course,
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse.
He's going the distance.
