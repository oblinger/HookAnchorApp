play fought an indian woman who was insisting she was a man.  At end Qingling was there and some auntie asked if we were going to be having more children.
it was all done and said in a joking kind of a way.  very very odd dream!


Well, I had a dream at the end of the dream. What I remember is I was in some place with a lot of people and for some reason I was going to be fighting somebody, but it was like playboxing. I don't remember why. I was going to kind of show something. I was supposed to be set up with somebody who was a guy, but I was actually set up with somebody who was a woman. I said, what? I'm going to fight for her. They're like, oh, this is a guy. You know, look, I'm thinking it's not a guy. It's really a woman. It was an Indian one, she kind of got an Indian marble on. We kind of began fighting and she's not really fighting very strongly and she's kind of, instead of jumping and stuff, she's kind of sashaying. I'm throwing some punches. This is really a guy. What are we doing? I don't really feel very good about this. not really. I'm not throwing punches, she's fighting though, but she's kind of sitting away, you can't really hit me very hard. And I'm not, but I'm sort of doing the fighting. We're kind of dancing around each other. But I'm throwing punches, but I'm not feeling like I should be throwing really hard ones. And so I'm not. And she kind of tells me I shouldn't. I'm like, so what am I doing here? And so finally, I... I said, okay, this... I'm not feeling good about this. And I kind of stopped. And so everybody kind of stops. And you know, her... I feel like her parents were there. She's also an adult. And you know, and they didn't think this was the right thing. And I don't know. Everybody kind of understood while the fighting stopped. And I think Chingling was there too. Yeah. And then, where I was leaving, I don't know, they're giving away little gifts, little chocolates and stuff, and I get one from her family. And they were talking to her and kind of ignoring me a little bit. as we're going out, we kind of. I'm all pressed together and I'm kind of pressed towards her a little bit. We're kind of a crowd and our parents are there. And Chingling, I think, is kind of right in front of me. And they say something about having more children. I said, well, we've got one and, you know, we're talking about having more. Not kind of laugh. It was just odd. It was very friendly, though. I mean, you know, there weren't... The fight was kind of friendly. The whole situation was kind of friendly. It was just... But I was supposed to fight somebody as sort of like an exhibition. It just wasn't supposed to be a woman and also a woman who was not really a fighter. So it was just a zod. And not an Indian woman, an Indian garb.


### 2025-05-08  Trying to get a groove on
- The number of quality work hours per day is not very good. My motivation and organization could be better.
- My ability to deliver goals that are not immediately required externally is not great.  I think I am too ambitious, and too demoralized.
- I need to put attention to my emotions, my processes, and targets.

### 2024-05-01  Reflection on 2023
- I grew to really do things and engage strongly with Eli
- I grew dramatically at Sports Visio into the CTO role.
  I am now a pretty damn strong CTO.
- Biggest learning from failure is to learn that I need to move fast.
	- Strong in the moment planning and org needed.
	- Focus on delegation and empowerment of others
	- Focus on fewer activities

- A year of transition from stasis toward action.  (but mostly still in stasis)
- Family grew a bit in doing things together
- Health was not a focus

WHAT WOULD BE 10X BETTER IN 2024?
- Healthy - Totally kicking it health wise.  VO2max jumping up
	- 40-min 4x week in health
- Spiritually strong - Iron discipline about thinking @ night
- Lock & loaded on dan-next:
	- Geared for gen-AI
- Back to great intimacy
	- ??? - Bi-monthly dating & family nights
- Energized by daily activity
	- Twice weekly FUN ACTIVITIES

Our marriage is in trouble.  I feel resistance to even trying to interact.


### 2024-04-02  Equanimity

My days are spent constantly tripping from one thing to the next, never feeling caught up, never feeling enough, rarely feeling effective.  Always with confidence that I could do so much more with my talents than I am.

**Actually this could stop today.**  From a certain perspective I AM as caught up as I ever will be.  I will always have many more things I want to get done than I have time to do them.  Of course at a tactical level I could get more caught up on pressing things of the moment, and I want to do this.  And I could get more effective with my hours, so that I can get more things done in a week.  And I want to do that too.  Still even if I succeed in doing this I will essentially be where I already am right now: done with many things, yet still many more things still un-done. 

**Thus I resolve.**  Today I am caught up, it is enough, and I have equanimity right now.  Then within this space of equanimity I will progressively move to clear my plate of the great back log of immediate actions either my doing them, or my relegating them to a "someday" list which mostly means "never" to be done.  And very slowly I will advance my ability to work effectively on important activities so that I am a bit more effective than I am today.

**Most Importantly.**  These activities must result in a sense of completion, and actual space for non-work activities.... time with family.  spirituality.  projects and fun.  Not many hours of each, there are not the hours required to do as much as I imagine.  still there will be enough.
