Thought I’d also send some other links for listening along.  I’m still doing my outline of the Bible, not going quickly but it is good.  Just finished Habakkuk tonight.  I found this - [https://bibleproject.com/explore/book-overviews/](https://bibleproject.com/explore/book-overviews/).  It’s basically a crowdfunded website started by a born-again former skateboarder and a creative techie type.  Some Tim Keller types have concerns about some of the details, and I think I like my Bible handbook more for a closer look.  But, in 16 minutes of cartoons it gave me a great overview/framework for the 66 chapter book of Isaiah.  Plus, the Gospel Coalition (Tim Keller, again) just came out with a new Bible aid commentary ([https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/commentary/](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/commentary/)) so it’s just a few clicks away for a closer look.  I think more cartoons are in my future though.  

I also found this, [https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/need-not-call](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/need-not-call).  Apologies if I’ve sent it before.  I’ve been talking through it with my friend Charles, though it’s reminded me of the conversation you and I had at that café when I actually got to come visit at your house.  I want answers from it!  But, the biggest one I seem to keep getting is to keep reading the Old Testament.
