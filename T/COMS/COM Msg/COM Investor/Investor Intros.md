Joe,

I think you saw my announcement about joining Sports Visio.  I am excited about the opportunity.  It is building tech very related to the computer vision work like we did at Martian Robots, but applying it to sports stats.  Incumbents in that space are using manual labor to product stats.  This costs many multiples of what we are able to do using AI and computer vision,  and it provides so much less details since each additional bit of information requires more human labor which jacks up the already high pricing.

We are getting ready to do a bridge round of financing and I thought I might have a call with you and pick your brain for strategies and possible connections…  plus we are overdue for a general catch up call!  What is a good time for you?  I am pretty available thurs & Friday this week if any time work from your side.


(I would much rather do a lunch meeting, but alas Vegas is a bit too far for such an adventure.  When is your next trip this way?)

Cheers, 
Dan

Peter, 

Thanks for the thumbs up on my Linked-In announcement in joining Sports Visio.  I am excited about the opportunity.  It is building tech very related to the computer vision work that I did at Aeolus Robotics, but applying it to sports stats.  Incumbents in that space are using manual labor to product stats.  This costs many multiples of what we are able to do using AI and computer vision,  and it provides so much less details since each additional bit of information requires more human labor which jacks up the already high pricing.

I am guessing at woven you are no stranger to the dramatic revolution that has happened in computer vision over the last few years.  I would love to hear what you are doing there and your take on how the technology is going to roll out in that space.  The next time you are out the the TRI lab here in silicon valley, please spare a few minutes for us to grab a coffee, I will come down.  Gil Pratt and I were both program managers at DARPA together, so I have kept up a bit with what the US lab--it would be great to see you both if that ended up working out!

The reason I am reaching out now:  I saw that you are connected with Kelly Chen at DCVC (Data Collective VCs) and was hoping that I could get an intro through you.  She is focused on AI & Robotics so she will appreciate my Founding of Martian Robotics, work at Aeolus Robotics, and our current computer vision-based approach as well.

Let me know if I should send an intro paragraph to forward along to Kelly.

Cheers, 
Dan






### 2023-04-18  Madrona - Michael Witbrock


MADRONA - Seed, early stage and acceleration stage investor and partner for founders. Investing for over 25 years in startups in the Pacific NW, now investing here and across the US in machine learning, AI, marketplaces, devops, biotech and across the technology spectrum.

Michael,

I think you saw on Linked-In that I just joined Sports Visio as their CTO. I would love to give you the update sometime, as well as hear about your transition from number two at a research Co into number one at an institute.  Are you ever in the bay area by any chance?

I am writing because of your connection to Babak Parviz from Madrona Ventures, I am hoping to get an introduction.
Madrona focuses on early stage ML companies and they have both Computer Vision and Sports Tech in their portfolio so it seems like a strong fit for SportsVisio.

I am really excited about the opportunity as it leverages the same computer vision technologies as I used at Aeolus Robotics but in the mature field of sports stats where the incumbents are using manual labor to provide stats, AI will completely disrupt this model, especially in parts of the market that are simply too price sensitive to afford the $50-80 per game that manual annotation requires.

Let me know if I should send an an intro paragraph I can forward along.  And let me know if your ever in the bay areas it would be great to catch up!

Cheers, 
Dan

### 2023-04-27  My Intro


XXX,

Responding to your request for a forwardable email. The company is called [Sports Visio](https://sportsvisio.com/), we are using AI/Computer Vision to automatically calculate stats/analytics video highlights for sports. We can do it for $20-25 a game (our costs are around $10 and we can get it down to $3-4) when incumbent large firms like Hudl and Synergy do it manually for $50-80/game. (And humans sitting sideline do 1/4 the stats and no video for $25/game poorly!) We have 3 AI PhDs plus two MS graduates driving our AI team as well as a team of software engineers, sales/marketing/etc. Market for basketball is $1.5B (bottoms up analysis) and total market including other sports is approximately $18B. We aren't raising at the moment (we raised $3.1M last year led by Hyperplane, with Sovereign's Capital and Geek Ventures participating) but will be this Spring and are thinking of who we'd want to talk to. I keep hearing good things about Mucker despite my negative experience (set up a meeting that was a no show and no follow up). But two friends of mine have been strong endorsements so I'm assuming it was just a mixup.

Got a free ride for computer engineering and worked 9 years focused in hacking/cyber warfare/tech development. Served as a program manager at [DARPA](https://t.sidekickopen10.com/s3t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8c82QMW27Rw3m59hl3kW7_k2841CXdp3VPw-j-58ytGhW2dykgT1wsJRm101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-3H3br6w3yMkgD48R2&si=8000000002212955&pi=3bbcd12a-e8d5-4fce-e6e3-98bb940c0d3d) running a classified portfolio of $100M in tech programs, then started a cyber security tech firm. Spun out a patent and some code to a VC-backed startup that raised $18M, and wanted to launch several others but ended up selling to a PE-backed firm. I had an 8-digit exit and used those resources to start a charitable foundation. Have invested over 30 times as the CIO (as well as my own retirement funds) into over 25 tech firms while running [10X Venture Partners](https://t.sidekickopen10.com/s3t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8c82QMW27Rw3m59hl3kW7_k2841CXdp3VPw-j-58ytGhW2dykgT1wsJRm101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-1Q2Z1nw45lvZ548S2&si=8000000002212955&pi=3bbcd12a-e8d5-4fce-e6e3-98bb940c0d3d), an angel group (we also started a small fund I run.) Ramped down investing to a minimum to focus on the startup full time, and put $500k of my retirement money into it so I'm all in.

Sports Visio uses AI/computer vision to automatically calculate sports stats and highlights. We can do this for $20-25 per game (with costs around $10 eventually to be reduced to $3-4) while incumbent large firms like Hudl and Synergy do this manually for $50-80 per game.  Based on my experiences founding/exiting robotic/vision companies I knew the time was ripe for market disruptions based on deep-learned vision.  Sport stats is particularly exciting as it is well established with existing multi-billon dollar competitors *and* completely virgin market-segments that cannot be touched using the existing manual methods.  Further automation provides a level of game analysis that is simply impossible to duplicate via manual methods.  Thus, I believe the entire industry will be fully disrupted in the next few short years.

I chose Sport Stats since its market value is well established, and having virgin market segments open for the taking as incumbent simply cannot offer products with viable price points.

I've played basketball for 30+ years, my kids have all played (my oldest is 22) and I've coached for 15 years which inspired the idea. Plan to use the majority of my funds from this exit for our foundation and some other non profit initiatives.

SportsVisio is a AI/Computer-Vision-based company doing Sports Analytics and highlights.

We are in a space where incumbents like Hudl and Synergy are MANUALLY doing this at $50/80 a game, but we are able to do this for $20-25/game (where our automation costs around $10/game) and will be able to get this down to $3-4/game.  Down market teams will have people sitting court side providing only 1/4 of these stats and doing it (poorly) for $25/game.

The founder is a close friend of mine from DARPA (he was also a PM).


In this deep learning wonderland, it was a bit hard to decide which startup to do next.

SportsVisio was unique in having market risk off the table while still having open markets ready the taking.
Upmarket there are billion dollar companies providing basketball stats that are derived COMPLETELY MANUALLY!  They are not price sensitive so there is less pressure to use AI for automation, but down market in 

Upmarket in high schools, colleges, and the pros the market of supplying basket ball stats is pretty proven and mature, but 
We do automated basketballs stats, which is a pretty mature market



SportsVisio won out because of the connection to the founder, and also because its market risk
