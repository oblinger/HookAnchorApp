### 2023-04-18  Jason (Harvard Alumni Group)
Wow, this exercise is actually turning kind of interesting. I didn't realize our next largest investor (Harvard's Alumni angel group) ALSO was referred by John Clemente. Maybe we should find out about HIS introductory emails! :-) This turned into a quarter million dollar investment. Sovereign's Capital was like $200k and they came from my involvement in the faith driven investor/entrepreneur community so that one feels a little like cheating. Chuck Saia's angel group invested $150k or so but that was from John Gargasz, who's part of 10X with me. Geek Ventures did around $100k in the F&F round but I knew him from poker. The first $600k was basically all my immediate network (I think like $75k came from Sam, so I guess only 85% was my network), then the $2.5M was $1.5M from Hyperplane, $250k from HBSAANY, $200k Sovereign's, $150k from Saia's group, $200k from two Christian guys I met at a men's retreat in Wyoming and the rest from other angels (mostly my network that missed the earlier rounds). 

  

Bottom line is personally I would recommend that you focus on why YOU are excited about it. Focus on your relationship with me, the tech, that even though you didn't know that market when you dug into it and started seeing some data it's a lot bigger than you realized, and you were excited about the team (or whatever motivated you). Tell them we were psyched to get you on board to help our tech get even stronger and work well together. If there's enough of a relationship with them to get an introduction, then I can close on all the business stuff if we get to pitch. Honestly looking back my emails that had lots of information didn't do any better than the others, the ones that mattered were the good introductions we got from allies that got me an opportunity to take a shot, and those closed at a high rate. The random weak connections sometimes got to the pitch stage but didn't close almost ever. (From my after-midnight random email analysis, would be better to do a thorough analysis of each link if I had more time/energy!)

### 2023-04-17 John Murphy - Hyperplane Investor

Dan,

  

This is a funny one to send, but I wanted to show you the email thread that led to our investing lead. As you'll note, it has way less content in it than the other ones (none of which led to investing). It has nothing, except a guy who's a friend of mine (he pitched me for investment a couple of years back and we became friends and have lunch periodically) who I asked to make some friendly introductions and he did. This call with John led to some equally non-detailed emails around a follow up meeting which happened in their offices. I gave the pitch, they loved it. Had dinner with the GP and they invested. That was it. Amplifies my interest in personal networks and introductions and not the blind stuff, which have gone very poorly statistically (but not zero)

### 2023-04-17 Chuck
This is an email I sent to an investor trying to introduce us to a potential university customer/partner. Not what you asked for, but it was different enough I thought it might be useful to see.

Chuck,

  

My apologies, I reached out to our growth lead about a deck and he hasn't responded yet. Just wrote him a curt email on that! 

  

Honestly the web site has a lot of our best material, if you want to send him that. Here's a great 30 second Youtube video showing what it looks like: [https://youtu.be/gmZbecvtfzk](https://youtu.be/gmZbecvtfzk) 

  

The major points we share with customers when talking with them:

  

1) Coaches, players, parents all get an app (iphone and/or Android) and can see the stats/highlights for all the players and share on social media

2) It doesn't require any special hardware, it works off a mobile phone on a tripod or can work with their camera system (depending on what they have)

3) It's a fraction of the price of platforms like Synergy (which is over $3k for a season), we're only $750 for a college team

4) It's a new platform, so we are adding new features all the time. We plan to add live streaming of games, modifying highlights with graphics (fireball, circles around players, etc.) in the next few months

5) Along those lines, it currently takes a day or two to process the games (we have humans reviewing the content too to make sure it's accurate) but as it gets faster we'll eventually have it available to use going into halftime on your phone.

6) If relevant to the audience, I'll sometimes share my personal background/charitable focus (grew up poor, retired at 42 and donated most of my proceeds to charity, using this to try to drive more resources to charity, company is donating 10% of profits to charities, etc.)

7) Miami Select (a semi-pro league) and Oxford University are both using it, as are numerous high schools and men's leagues and others and we just launched last month

  

Hope those are useful talking points, if you want me to put something together let me know. We've focused our marketing material around the web site and videos/social media as that's where most of our customers see us. 

  

Jason

Here's one that I wrote back in February. It's one of my more verbose ones, I don't always share this much but I DO tend to err on the side of oversharing. Not saying that's optimal but it tends to be my modus operandi... I tend to think if you believe in what you're doing/have a cool story, acting cool/too humble/secretive isn't as useful to anyone as trying to just be open and transparent and let them make their own conclusions. This guy was someone I knew (his firm had pitched me for investor dollars) and I gave him a lengthy email. Some numbers are off (I think the $10/game number isn't right currently, although our internal models show the AI in the cloud could be less than that, it's hard to know for sure when it will end up and manual is around $15/game at the moment)

  

I'll find a few others to send you.

Lance,

  

Responding to your request for a forwardable email. The company is called [Sports Visio](https://sportsvisio.com/), we are using AI/Computer Vision to automatically calculate stats/analytics video highlights for sports. We can do it for $20-25 a game (our costs are around $10 and we can get it down to $3-4) when incumbent large firms like Hudl and Synergy do it manually for $50-80/game. (And humans sitting sideline do 1/4 the stats and no video for $25/game poorly!) We have 3 AI PhDs plus two MS graduates driving our AI team as well as a team of software engineers, sales/marketing/etc. Market for basketball is $1.5B (bottoms up analysis) and total market including other sports is approximately $18B. We aren't raising at the moment (we raised $3.1M last year led by Hyperplane, with Sovereign's Capital and Geek Ventures participating) but will be this Spring and are thinking of who we'd want to talk to. I keep hearing good things about Mucker despite my negative experience (set up a meeting that was a no show and no follow up). But two friends of mine have been strong endorsements so I'm assuming it was just a mixup. 

  

[My background](https://t.sidekickopen10.com/s3t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8c82QMW27Rw3m59hl3kW7_k2841CXdp3VPw-j-58ytGhW2dykgT1wsJRm101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-3ZWVWBW3K2-zv1JxwY5W1Lyz993W1-CTw3K8R4y48T2&si=8000000002212955&pi=3bbcd12a-e8d5-4fce-e6e3-98bb940c0d3d): Grew up in Suburbia 0-10 and in (American) poverty aged 10-18) (holes in my socks, food stamps, homeless for a summer, etc.). Got a free ride for computer engineering and worked 9 years focused in hacking/cyber warfare/tech development. Served as a program manager at [DARPA](https://t.sidekickopen10.com/s3t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8c82QMW27Rw3m59hl3kW7_k2841CXdp3VPw-j-58ytGhW2dykgT1wsJRm101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-3H3br6w3yMkgD48R2&si=8000000002212955&pi=3bbcd12a-e8d5-4fce-e6e3-98bb940c0d3d) running a classified portfolio of $100M in tech programs, then started a cyber security tech firm. Spun out a patent and some code to a VC-backed startup that raised $18M, and wanted to launch several others but ended up selling to a PE-backed firm. I had an 8-digit exit and used those resources to start a charitable foundation. Have invested over 30 times as the CIO (as well as my own retirement funds) into over 25 tech firms while running [10X Venture Partners](https://t.sidekickopen10.com/s3t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8c82QMW27Rw3m59hl3kW7_k2841CXdp3VPw-j-58ytGhW2dykgT1wsJRm101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-1Q2Z1nw45lvZ548S2&si=8000000002212955&pi=3bbcd12a-e8d5-4fce-e6e3-98bb940c0d3d), an angel group (we also started a small fund I run.) Ramped down investing to a minimum to focus on the startup full time, and put $500k of my retirement money into it so I'm all in.

  

I've played basketball for 30+ years, my kids have all played (my oldest is 22) and I've coached for 15 years which inspired the idea. Plan to use the majority of my funds from this exit for our foundation and some other non profit initiatives.
