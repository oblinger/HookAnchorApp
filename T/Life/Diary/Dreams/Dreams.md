### 2025-08-04  Asian Ordering / Pillow scream

- was with group of asians (in asia) who were my work collegues.  they helped me order some game (or dish) on my phone, where they needed to switch languages to complete the order... I could not do it in english text.
- We were ordering a sequence of games or food dishes to be sent to me.
- It was explained that it was best if the game was played on a physical board, instead of in the book.  
- It was like a book of puzzles like a suduko book, but the puzzles had a many many level gradation in difficulty.
- I was told to stop jumping around and don't skip puzzles start w/ easiest and do them all in order.

- Went to a neighbor's house, there was a kindly and cogent old man 78y/o who had a physical compulsion to scream into a pillow every so often, but we spoke calmly, most of the time.  He was embarrassed by this, but  I seemed to take this in stride and told him not to worry, I understood is condition.
