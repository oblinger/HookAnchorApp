RAW NOTES:
So then I told her there must only be one physicist since there's only one physics since there's only one model they said that it only pertain to one there weren't multiple instances of this particular kind of science I don't remember


There was some theory that she or I put forward, but one could naturally apply it to her work which would make it silly / irrelevant.
When I woke I was very clear on what that theory was.... but not now.

I am speaking to an Asian female researcher who is claiming that there is only one correct model of the physical universe governed by a single law.
We debated that some, then on an elevator going up after those discussions I said: 
  "well, if as you say, there is can only be one kind of physics, then there should only be one physicist"

the implication is that we would not need any more since it is only one law, and by implication she need not be a Physicist.

The dream ended on the elevator with us both laughing, since I was not seriously challenging her career.

## 2025-08-04  Asian Ordering / Pillow scream

- was with group of asians (in asia) who were my work collegues.  they helped me order some game (or dish) on my phone, where they needed to switch languages to complete the order... I could not do it in english text.
- We were ordering a sequence of games or food dishes to be sent to me.
- It was explained that it was best if the game was played on a physical board, instead of in the book.  
- It was like a book of puzzles like a suduko book, but the puzzles had a many many level gradation in difficulty.
- I was told to stop jumping around and don't skip puzzles start w/ easiest and do them all in order.

- Went to a neighbor's house, there was a kindly and cogent old man 78y/o who had a physical compulsion to scream into a pillow every so often, but we spoke calmly, most of the time.  He was embarrassed by this, but  I seemed to take this in stride and told him not to worry, I understood is condition.
