### 2024-01-02  the 2024 life reset

- Build sustained, effective action
- Focus on key things most impt in ALL areas
- Live a little



### 2023-12-04  Depressive-time-suck

Sunday was a pretty big waste.
- Just not motivated so I kill many hours watching TV or reading/write on Medium
- Need to organize fun into my week so I am motivated
- Need to really organize my energies into actionable channels, so I make bite-sized progress in key areas so I feel better.
  Adding this to [[full]] section.


### 2023-11-27  Obispo-Trip.  am I depressed?

Travelled to Saint Louis Obispo over the weekend.
Being on the beach with Eli was fun, but in general these days I have little motivation to do hard things.

I think I need to focus on growing this motivation
I need to re-frame what really matters to me.

I think my motivation is low, because clarity of my mission is so poor.


Too many things have been accepted... too many abstract plans to someday fix all of them.

Feels overwhelming... I play solitaire instead!

### 2023-11-07  Two Blistering Avoidance Failures:  Eating the Frog.  Exercising.

My ability to push myself is just not strong, if I have some activity that I am avoiding then I really go into a tail spin and just never do the activity.


### 2023-08-21  Gratitude Meditation; Feeling valued @ work

Gratitude meditation course is giving a new view on my day to day.
I do have much to be happy with, and much to enjoy with Eli.

And for my present role at SV, I am delivering a ton of value, and I am recognized for that value.  So I think I need to relax away from the stress regarding this topic.

Today did have a small backdrop of stress, as I am just "on" and pushing the whole day.  I like the task of getting folks moving on the "ingest" problem @ work, but still it is novel for me to be pushing the ball on so many things at once.  I need to learn how to manage this w/ less stress.

### 2023-06-20  A HAH - Treadmill

I am living on a self-inflicted treadmill.
I never feel I am remotely caught up.

Key Issue:
- I do chew first, thus prime things slip so I feel/am behind
- If prime things are not fun enough, wont do them
  need to shape aims to be more fun, or drop them

Approach:
- Do prime things first, chew will slip, thats ok
- Radical streamlining of prime list needed
	- Drop many things
	- Do others FAST, with 80/20 thinking
	- Delegate, Multitask, Track

- Less Is More.  Be happy with less done & planned
- Broaden list of things getting 'prime' time





### 2023-06-20  Work First; Streamlining; 

Observation:  All of my chew tasks eat up much of my prime working time, and I am not getting important stuff done.

Proposed Approach:
- Meetings - My day typically begins with 1-2 hours of meetings.
- Flash Check - based on email senders and slack channel I *ONLY* look for emergencies, usual there are few/none.
- Prime - Then I try to work on any F1 tasks under work, now, or week
- Eat - While reading or fun chew tasks
- Chew - Daily & Chew tasks are done in the afternoon/evening

This week I am getting more 'prime' tasks done.  Still not as many hours as I hope.  BUT
It really helped that this weekend I really cleaned up my F1 lists well so things are organized.
Still don't feel like I am quite getting as much prime tasks as I hope, but definitely way more (than the typical ZERO from before)

Makes me realize I need to streamline my prime and chew tasks dramatically.
Makes me realize I can achieve SO much more, by saying no, by delgating, by being intelligent, by streamlining tasks.

==> Need to start adding:  Startup thinking, and Networking thinking to my weekly mix
==> Need further steamlining first, and need to get small tactical plans for these activities



### 2023-04-24  Lesson Learned:  I am too tactical, too insecure, not proactive @ high level, & running from fear


- GUT KNOWLEDGE - I have known from the start that my position seemed untenable, 
- AVOIDANCE RESPONSE - But I ran from this issue rather than confronting it.
- ***SHINY THINGS - I worked furiously on other things instead of the key thing that needed fixing***.   <--- key point
- INSECURE - I am insecure in feeling I needed more coding & algo strength than I now do for the CTO job
  INSECURE - Not acknowledging broad strengths that others see in me.
  INSECURE - in feeling that I am "not worth" the extra equity over Mike/Brian
- NOT TALKING - Not talking with Jason/sam nearly enough
- NOT SEEING - Jason feels isolated at the top, and I should have seen this


NEED TO GROW A PAIR! - Just assume I am amazing and can own any piece that is needed, and figure out what is really needed here.



### 2023-04-12  PIVOT - shift towards AI




### 2023-04-04  STRESS!  Feel my path AT SV is time limited


I have never jumped into a job more fervently than at SV.
I feel I am provided value and help



### 2023-03-31  Week travel to Disney

Trip to Disney was a great way to spend time with Eli and QL.
I was able to enjoy the trip, and QL gave me time to work too.

I am feeling like I can get on top of my job with enough room left over to start taking on the rest of life.

But I need to use the same efficiencies to other parts of life in order to get them to fit into available time.  My three strategies:
- Just say 'no' - find ways to get stuff off my lists.
- Put in more hours - avoid frittered time, and get more time in.
- Get obsidian organized about all these areas, so with limited time I can dispatch the core stuff in efficient ways

==> Want to make progress of 'self' items, and want to have feeling of spare time... just small amounts, but not the feeling of overwhelm that I have had my whole adult life.



### 2023-03-21  Back from all hands; feeling of efficiency coming!


Wow, my ability to execute feels stronger and strong by the day!

OBSERVATION:  I *am* a cat person, I DIVE on a juicy problem that looks like it is just about to get away with fervor!  But I often want to jump from task to task, w/o specific timeline (except for move FASTER).  But I tire of working on the same task for too many hours.  I am happiest to have a rotation of five all in motion.


Still, my execution is very dependent upon avoidance of too many meetings.  Still building that muscle.

Also I should take extra care to be humble as I am feeling stronger and stronger in my ability to execute.
I think there is a risk that my confidence will spill over into a kind of patronizing of Jason, or riding rough on Mike.



### Dream: "what am I getting myself into"

Woke this morning with a feeling that doing the "crush it" talk in Argentina that I am signing myself up to be a maniac worker for the next many years.

Maybe I am to some degree, but I do need to deliver value, and this is one kind of value I can deliver.  I still think I can shape the job stay out of many of the weeds, AND get stronger in CV at the same time.


worried about this issue, but I am hopeful I can manage it.

And it is part of an evolving picture of what I can deliver in future jobs too.  My biggest worry is that I will only earn 200-300K at SV but need more in order to retire well.





### 2023-03-01  Mid Week - Different kind of tracking
- Before SV I needed to track that I was getting stuff done each day
- Now I am "running hot" with many actions happening each day
- But not necessarily the most important actions happening all the time
- Idea: track 'buckets' of activity in order to ensure good percentage is going in best directions

 [[BKT]]  


### 2023-02-27  Week 2 at SV 

- **EFFECTIVE** - For the first time in a long time I feel like I am being particularly effective with my time.  Why?
	- DELEGATE - I quickly cut to the nub of many issues, so I can delegate quickly.  and I LIKE delegating.
	- FIREHOSE - I like surfing many different issues, and putting bits of high value time against them.
	- CAT - I get to choose which task I will add value, how and when.
	- TEMPO - stuff happening is at a high tempo; it puts me into a high tempo

- **MY VALUE** - I went from feeling insecure in what value I might bring to SV, into a mode where it is clear of the value that I can bring on a sustained basis, and how I am able to "level up" my value, by getting to the top of the pyramid in all areas:
	- Low-hours, high-coverage tracking of ALL of SW Execution
	- Occasional collaborative creation of processes across ALL of SW and ALL of the Company
	- Investor Relations, Fund raising, 
	- Planning/Managing/Execution/Delivery of high value planning, and projects  (e.g. Bridge Round Prep)


I think/hope I can quickly become super time efficient at juggling many balls and have spare time/energy for growth and other things.
Controlling my time & deliveries is key to delivering high value & having spare energy/time

This job is fun, and jobs like this will continue to be fun.

Maybe I supplement this job to make a high income?
