### 2024-10-01  Focus needs to be on MIT hours

just not hitting the numbers needed.
### 2024-09-24  My 1/2 time plan

My goal is to ensure that at least my Tuesday / Thursday time is spent on my priorities:

- Next Job: Learn and Ready
- Self: many

For this week, My aim is to hit 4hr per day for this.
Aim low, but hit the target!!  :-)


### 2024-09-17  If I want to get more done, I need to focus my time

Each day I am planning what I will do, then tracking what I did do.
It is surprising how small the fraction is of my day that goes to things I hope to increase.
My idea for the next days is to track this each day and try to shift the fraction of desired ones.


### 2024-09-09  Went to 1/2 time at SV

The idea going 1/2 time is that 
- I really WILL re-coup at least 1/3 time in order to job search
- I will be able to keep Jason happy and look good
- I will still be able to spend a bit of time getting more technical --modest time
- I will be able to swing back to full time and stay at SV in the unlikely event that I want to do that

mostly unclear if I can re-tool enough to change the kinds of jobs I can get.

A little optimistic but also apprehensive about my upcoming job search

### 2024-08-22  My Biggest Issue: Daily hours on MIT

I am stressed on a daily basis, and I think the biggest stressor is lack of progress on my job search.  This is because I don't work on it.

I really need to re-shape how I work so that I DO work on my MIT task both for work and for next job.

UPSIDE: The good news is that this is an absolutely essential skill if I am to successfully make a transition to a strong next job.  

DOWNSIDE:  And my big challenge is that I don't think I have ever been good at doing this
### 2024-08-14  Stressed & Procrastinating

Well I am procrastinating right now!

I am stressed that 
- Jason does not find full value from me at Sports Visio, AND 
- I am going to have difficulty finding a good job in this market, AND 
- I have missed the boat in doing research which I trained for and like doing.

I don't think it is as bad as all of that.  I think I am painting an overly negative picture, 
But emotionally this is the way things feel, and there is at least some truth the picture.

As a result I am pushing things off,
not getting to the most important stuff, and
not working enough focused hours per day.

**My plan**:

Each day I need to put in at least 3 hours on key activities
Never below 2 and trying to hit 4.

### 2024-06-08  Saying Goodbye to Yoshiko



Yoshiko its Dan.

The drifted apart
- not impt part of my life.
- on my list to re-connect
- young son
- I guess this voice message will have to do

Thinking back there are alot of happy memories
- simple ones like your dinners prepared with care for when I would travel to Princeton for the weekend.
- The way you were always so so crazy happy if I would repair anything.  I think your plan was to make me feel like a complete genius... and it really kinda worked!
- mom's wrapping
- ashley's rememberance
- my high school reunion


More than any other thing, the one that I wanted to tell you these many years later is how badly I missed a most important thing about you while I was with you.  I knew it at the time, but I never really appreciated it!

You are a ray of sunshine to every person in your life.  Your smile, and your presence as soon as you would walk into a room.  everyone could feel it.

It was great to have that as part of my life.  A crazy rare gift actually.  More anything else, you are a walking ball of joy, and it makes the time anyone spends around you joyful.  

I was damn lucky to experience that, I miss it, and I will always miss it, and miss you.

I will never forget you Yoshiko, my big yellow birdie.
Lots of love always. 
-- dan



Hey this is Dan, Yoshiko's boyfriend from years ago  (I think you will remember me from my stay at your parents house and the trip where I took you and Yoshiko to Eiheiji temple). I am so shocked to learn that Yoshiko is in hospice! so, so very sad!  I recorded a letter that I am hoping she is still able to understand.  If you think she would enjoy hearing an audio letter, it would be great if you could play it for her.  I wish I could tell her in person!  I am happy for any details if you think she was or wasn't able to hear it.  This is all so so sad!

Yours, 
Dan






~~
Yoshiko, it's Dan Ablinger from New York City. I heard just recently, a couple days ago actually, some shocking news that you're in hospice and very ill. I still can't quite believe it. I know you were running races and I don't know, it's very hard for me to imagine. Okay. It's been, it's been more than 10 years, I think, since the last time we spoke. I never intended to, to let us drift apart. The truth is when I started doing startups out here in California, I actually drifted away from a lot of my friends. And you were on my list to reconnect to, for the last two years. I really felt like there was one or two things that, that I wanted to say to you, when reconnecting. And, well, I guess this voice message will have to do. You know, I'm just kind of thinking back on our time together. There's really were a lot of happy memories. Most of them were very simple things. I remember the way you were just so crazy happy if I would repair anything. I don't know. I fixed a window at one time and I remember there was something electric. I remember what it was. Each time you feel like a complete genius. I think it was your plan, but it kind of worked. My mom still remembers and often will say something at Christmas time when we're wrapping up the gifts. I don't know if you remember, but that was your job when you were in town. Well, gifts definitely haven't been wrapped as precisely. More beautifully is that. Since then. And my cousin Ashley, I don't know if you remember her, she was young, she was probably eight. No, maybe a little bit more, maybe ten. When you were coming for Christmases. And to her you were the cosmopolitan woman. And so, I don't know, she always would refer back to you and say that. That she kind of wanted to be like you. I mean, she's since grown and probably grown out of that. But that was her memory. I remember my high school reunion, I don't know if you remember, we're on a boat. And you're very gregarious and very happy. And so, still now when I go back to my reunions, my classmates all remember you. And ask after you. But the reason I wanted to connect back, I did feel like there was something that ought to have been said. It's not exactly an apology. It's just, I was very unaware. Unaware of what I had in you. At the time, I knew it, but I just didn't appreciate it. You're very much a ray of sunshine for anybody. Your smile when you go into a room, lights the room up. Everybody can feel it. And it's a presence that I enjoy for a while. But never really. Appreciate it. And realize this over the years, as I just think back to all the different people I've known in my life, that really it's a crazy, rare gift. You're a walking ball of joy, and it makes the time that people spend around you joyful. I was damn lucky to experience that. I'll miss it. I'll always miss it and I'll miss you. I'll never forget you, Yoshiko. My big yellow birdie. Lots of love. Always. Dan. Okay. Okay.

Yo Shiko, this is Dan, Dan Ablinger from New York City. I just heard that you're in hospice and very ill. I was shocked to hear this. I knew that you had been running races not so long ago, so I couldn't quite believe it. It's been more than a decade since we last talked. And I never imagined that we would just drift apart and not talk. I guess my startup world had me moving away from a lot of my friends. I had the idea that I would reconnect with you over the last year or two. Over and over I kind of thought this was an important thing to do just because we were close and I think there was a few things left unsaid. At this point I guess this message is going to have to do since I've missed my chance for that. I was thinking back on a lot of the happy memories from the time we were together. Really just simple ones like the dinners that you prepared for when I would travel to Princeton for the weekend. They were simple but it was very nice. I was always so crazy happy if I would repair anything. I think it was your way of making me feel like a complete genius. It really worked. I don't know. I think I fixed your water at one point. I fixed something electrical. I can't remember what it was. You were just so happy about it. My mom still mentions you're wrapping. I don't know if you remember, but. Coming to my mom's house for Christmas, your job was always to wrap the gifts and you're quite precise about that. So they've not been wrapped as well since then. My cousin, I don't remember if you remember her. She was very young when you were there, but you were the cosmopolitan woman for her. her. So she's often... said things back to me, just asking about you years later. Of course, she's married now and has kids, but she still remembers. And when I go back to my high school reunion, if you remember when you were here, we went to my high school reunion and your gregarious smile definitely had lasting impact on on the folks that we met then. Then. But more than anything else, there was one thing I wanted to tell you that I felt needed to be said and it's one of the reasons I wanted to get back in contact with you. It's not exactly an apology, but years later looking at it, I knew at the time how special it was, your way of being, but I never appreciate. The reality is, you were a ray of sunshine for me, but for anybody in your life. Your smile and your presence when you came into a room, everybody could feel it. All of my friends felt it, everybody knew it, all of your friends of course knew it, and I was blessed by it and I really took it for granted. And that was the reason I'm not sure. I wanted to get back in touch with you. I felt like, I don't know, just that it was not handled well by me. I think it's a crazy, rare gift. And there's nothing more to say about it. I'm just sorry that I wasn't more appreciative when I had the chance. I was damn lucky to experience it. and I'll miss it and I'll miss you. I'll never forget you Yoshiko. Lots of love always. Bye bye. Okay.


### 2024-05-03  The way you work.... and don't work

- Under the gun, you perform
- When inspired you perform
- But after a period you take a break, and it all falls apart
  you blow out, with many hours frittered away, not with fun, but with distraction.

- But "fun" with family is not "fun"...  you rarely plan fun


### 2024-04-01  Control from topdown lists

- TOP DOWN CLEAN UP -
  Strong feeling of control from organizing / cleaning lists from top down.
- RAPID DELEGATE - 
  Strong feeling of velocity from rapidly tasking and delegating stuff to team members.
- top MANAGERS BRIONES & JUAN - 
  Velocity from setting up Briones and Juan.



### 2024-03-04  Occasional Loss of Traction;  now building BKT tree

- Sometimes I am pretty effective, and sometimes I will just loose 4 hours.

==> I know I need to "eat the frog" everyday...  this will really help.
==> I know I need built tree of actions so I have high ROI actions always ready to go
	- Need to better manage my transitions between activities




### 2024-01-28  Starting to feel caught up

I am going to bed by 11pm, and sometimes waking by 6am, this makes sleeping better and gives me some extra room some days.

- I am cranking thru my lists to delete stuff of finish stuff
- work lists is getting clean, starting to hit other lists.
- need to get 1-2h per day on personal stuff to clear the decks.
- Feel better now that schools are applied for, really was not such a big deal once we got to it.  (though QL was the one that actually filled them out!)


### 2024-01-02  the 2024 life reset

- Build sustained, effective action
- Focus on key things most impt in ALL areas
- Live a little



### 2023-12-04  Depressive-time-suck

Sunday was a pretty big waste.
- Just not motivated so I kill many hours watching TV or reading/write on Medium
- Need to organize fun into my week so I am motivated
- Need to really organize my energies into actionable channels, so I make bite-sized progress in key areas so I feel better.
  Adding this to [[Full]] section.


### 2023-11-27  Obispo-Trip.  am I depressed?

Travelled to Saint Louis Obispo over the weekend.
Being on the beach with Eli was fun, but in general these days I have little motivation to do hard things.

I think I need to focus on growing this motivation
I need to re-frame what really matters to me.

I think my motivation is low, because clarity of my mission is so poor.


Too many things have been accepted... too many abstract plans to someday fix all of them.

Feels overwhelming... I play solitaire instead!

### 2023-11-07  Two Blistering Avoidance Failures:  Eating the Frog.  Exercising.

My ability to push myself is just not strong, if I have some activity that I am avoiding then I really go into a tail spin and just never do the activity.


### 2023-08-21  Gratitude Meditation; Feeling valued @ work

Gratitude meditation course is giving a new view on my day to day.
I do have much to be happy with, and much to enjoy with Eli.

And for my present role at SV, I am delivering a ton of value, and I am recognized for that value.  So I think I need to relax away from the stress regarding this topic.

Today did have a small backdrop of stress, as I am just "on" and pushing the whole day.  I like the task of getting folks moving on the "ingest" problem @ work, but still it is novel for me to be pushing the ball on so many things at once.  I need to learn how to manage this w/ less stress.

### 2023-06-20  A HAH - Treadmill

I am living on a self-inflicted treadmill.
I never feel I am remotely caught up.

Key Issue:
- I do chew first, thus prime things slip so I feel/am behind
- If prime things are not fun enough, wont do them
  need to shape aims to be more fun, or drop them

Approach:
- Do prime things first, chew will slip, thats ok
- Radical streamlining of prime list needed
	- Drop many things
	- Do others FAST, with 80/20 thinking
	- Delegate, Multitask, Track

- Less Is More.  Be happy with less done & planned
- Broaden list of things getting 'prime' time





### 2023-06-20  Work First; Streamlining; 

Observation:  All of my chew tasks eat up much of my prime working time, and I am not getting important stuff done.

Proposed Approach:
- Meetings - My day typically begins with 1-2 hours of meetings.
- Flash Check - based on email senders and slack channel I *ONLY* look for emergencies, usual there are few/none.
- Prime - Then I try to work on any F1 tasks under work, now, or week
- Eat - While reading or fun chew tasks
- Chew - Daily & Chew tasks are done in the afternoon/evening

This week I am getting more 'prime' tasks done.  Still not as many hours as I hope.  BUT
It really helped that this weekend I really cleaned up my F1 lists well so things are organized.
Still don't feel like I am quite getting as much prime tasks as I hope, but definitely way more (than the typical ZERO from before)

Makes me realize I need to streamline my prime and chew tasks dramatically.
Makes me realize I can achieve SO much more, by saying no, by delgating, by being intelligent, by streamlining tasks.

==> Need to start adding:  Startup thinking, and Networking thinking to my weekly mix
==> Need further steamlining first, and need to get small tactical plans for these activities



### 2023-04-24  Lesson Learned:  I am too tactical, too insecure, not proactive @ high level, & running from fear


- GUT KNOWLEDGE - I have known from the start that my position seemed untenable, 
- AVOIDANCE RESPONSE - But I ran from this issue rather than confronting it.
- ***SHINY THINGS - I worked furiously on other things instead of the key thing that needed fixing***.   <--- key point
- INSECURE - I am insecure in feeling I needed more coding & algo strength than I now do for the CTO job
  INSECURE - Not acknowledging broad strengths that others see in me.
  INSECURE - in feeling that I am "not worth" the extra equity over Mike/Brian
- NOT TALKING - Not talking with Jason/sam nearly enough
- NOT SEEING - Jason feels isolated at the top, and I should have seen this


NEED TO GROW A PAIR! - Just assume I am amazing and can own any piece that is needed, and figure out what is really needed here.



### 2023-04-12  PIVOT - shift towards AI




### 2023-04-04  STRESS!  Feel my path AT SV is time limited


I have never jumped into a job more fervently than at SV.
I feel I am provided value and help



### 2023-03-31  Week travel to Disney

Trip to Disney was a great way to spend time with Eli and QL.
I was able to enjoy the trip, and QL gave me time to work too.

I am feeling like I can get on top of my job with enough room left over to start taking on the rest of life.

But I need to use the same efficiencies to other parts of life in order to get them to fit into available time.  My three strategies:
- Just say 'no' - find ways to get stuff off my lists.
- Put in more hours - avoid frittered time, and get more time in.
- Get obsidian organized about all these areas, so with limited time I can dispatch the core stuff in efficient ways

==> Want to make progress of 'self' items, and want to have feeling of spare time... just small amounts, but not the feeling of overwhelm that I have had my whole adult life.



### 2023-03-21  Back from all hands; feeling of efficiency coming!


Wow, my ability to execute feels stronger and strong by the day!

OBSERVATION:  I *am* a cat person, I DIVE on a juicy problem that looks like it is just about to get away with fervor!  But I often want to jump from task to task, w/o specific timeline (except for move FASTER).  But I tire of working on the same task for too many hours.  I am happiest to have a rotation of five all in motion.


Still, my execution is very dependent upon avoidance of too many meetings.  Still building that muscle.

Also I should take extra care to be humble as I am feeling stronger and stronger in my ability to execute.
I think there is a risk that my confidence will spill over into a kind of patronizing of Jason, or riding rough on Mike.



### Dream: "what am I getting myself into"

Woke this morning with a feeling that doing the "crush it" talk in Argentina that I am signing myself up to be a maniac worker for the next many years.

Maybe I am to some degree, but I do need to deliver value, and this is one kind of value I can deliver.  I still think I can shape the job stay out of many of the weeds, AND get stronger in CV at the same time.


worried about this issue, but I am hopeful I can manage it.

And it is part of an evolving picture of what I can deliver in future jobs too.  My biggest worry is that I will only earn 200-300K at SV but need more in order to retire well.





### 2023-03-01  Mid Week - Different kind of tracking
- Before SV I needed to track that I was getting stuff done each day
- Now I am "running hot" with many actions happening each day
- But not necessarily the most important actions happening all the time
- Idea: track 'buckets' of activity in order to ensure good percentage is going in best directions

 [[BKT]]  


### 2023-02-27  Week 2 at SV 

- **EFFECTIVE** - For the first time in a long time I feel like I am being particularly effective with my time.  Why?
	- DELEGATE - I quickly cut to the nub of many issues, so I can delegate quickly.  and I LIKE delegating.
	- FIREHOSE - I like surfing many different issues, and putting bits of high value time against them.
	- CAT - I get to choose which task I will add value, how and when.
	- TEMPO - stuff happening is at a high tempo; it puts me into a high tempo

- **MY VALUE** - I went from feeling insecure in what value I might bring to SV, into a mode where it is clear of the value that I can bring on a sustained basis, and how I am able to "level up" my value, by getting to the top of the pyramid in all areas:
	- Low-hours, high-coverage tracking of ALL of SW Execution
	- Occasional collaborative creation of processes across ALL of SW and ALL of the Company
	- Investor Relations, Fund raising, 
	- Planning/Managing/Execution/Delivery of high value planning, and projects  (e.g. Bridge Round Prep)


I think/hope I can quickly become super time efficient at juggling many balls and have spare time/energy for growth and other things.
Controlling my time & deliveries is key to delivering high value & having spare energy/time

This job is fun, and jobs like this will continue to be fun.

Maybe I supplement this job to make a high income?
