### 2023-04-24  Lesson Learned:  I am too tactical, too insecure, not proactive @ high level, & running from fear


- GUT KNOWLEDGE - I have known from the start that my position seemed untenable, 
- AVOIDANCE RESPONSE - But I ran from this issue rather than confronting it.
- ***SHINY THINGS - I worked furiously on other things instead of the key thing that needed fixing***.   <--- key point
- INSECURE - I am insecure in feeling I needed more coding & algo strength than I now do for the CTO job
  INSECURE - Not acknowledging broad strengths that others see in me.
  INSECURE - in feeling that I am "not worth" the extra equity over Mike/Brian
- NOT TALKING - Not talking with Jason/sam nearly enough
- NOT SEEING - Jason feels isolated at the top, and I should have seen this


NEED TO GROW A PAIR! - Just assume I am amazing and can own any piece that is needed, and figure out what is really needed here.

### 2023-04-04  STRESS!  Feel my path AT SV is time limited


I have never jumped into a job more fervently than at SV.
I feel I am provided value and help



### 2023-03-31  Week travel to Disney

Trip to Disney was a great way to spend time with Eli and QL.
I was able to enjoy the trip, and QL gave me time to work too.

I am feeling like I can get on top of my job with enough room left over to start taking on the rest of life.

But I need to use the same efficiencies to other parts of life in order to get them to fit into available time.  My three strategies:
- Just say 'no' - find ways to get stuff off my lists.
- Put in more hours - avoid frittered time, and get more time in.
- Get obsidian organized about all these areas, so with limited time I can dispatch the core stuff in efficient ways

==> Want to make progress of 'self' items, and want to have feeling of spare time... just small amounts, but not the feeling of overwhelm that I have had my whole adult life.



### 2023-03-21  Back from all hands; feeling of efficiency coming!


Wow, my ability to execute feels stronger and strong by the day!

OBSERVATION:  I *am* a cat person, I DIVE on a juicy problem that looks like it is just about to get away with fervor!  But I often want to jump from task to task, w/o specific timeline (except for move FASTER).  But I tire of working on the same task for too many hours.  I am happiest to have a rotation of five all in motion.


Still, my execution is very dependent upon avoidance of too many meetings.  Still building that muscle.

Also I should take extra care to be humble as I am feeling stronger and stronger in my ability to execute.
I think there is a risk that my confidence will spill over into a kind of patronizing of Jason, or riding rough on Mike.



### Dream: "what am I getting myself into"

Woke this morning with a feeling that doing the "crush it" talk in Argentina that I am signing myself up to be a maniac worker for the next many years.

Maybe I am to some degree, but I do need to deliver value, and this is one kind of value I can deliver.  I still think I can shape the job stay out of many of the weeds, AND get stronger in CV at the same time.


worried about this issue, but I am hopeful I can manage it.

And it is part of an evolving picture of what I can deliver in future jobs too.  My biggest worry is that I will only earn 200-300K at SV but need more in order to retire well.





### 2023-03-01  Mid Week - Different kind of tracking
- Before SV I needed to track that I was getting stuff done each day
- Now I am "running hot" with many actions happening each day
- But not necessarily the most important actions happening all the time
- Idea: track 'buckets' of activity in order to ensure good percentage is going in best directions

### 2023-02-27  Week 2 at SV 

- **EFFECTIVE** - For the first time in a long time I feel like I am being particularly effective with my time.  Why?
	- DELEGATE - I quickly cut to the nub of many issues, so I can delegate quickly.  and I LIKE delegating.
	- FIREHOSE - I like surfing many different issues, and putting bits of high value time against them.
	- CAT - I get to choose which task I will add value, how and when.
	- TEMPO - stuff happening is at a high tempo; it puts me into a high tempo

- **MY VALUE** - I went from feeling insecure in what value I might bring to SV, into a mode where it is clear of the value that I can bring on a sustained basis, and how I am able to "level up" my value, by getting to the top of the pyramid in all areas:
	- Low-hours, high-coverage tracking of ALL of SW Execution
	- Occasional collaborative creation of processes across ALL of SW and ALL of the Company
	- Investor Relations, Fund raising, 
	- Planning/Managing/Execution/Delivery of high value planning, and projects  (e.g. Bridge Round Prep)


I think/hope I can quickly become super time efficient at juggling many balls and have spare time/energy for growth and other things.
Controlling my time & deliveries is key to delivering high value & having spare energy/time

This job is fun, and jobs like this will continue to be fun.

Maybe I supplement this job to make a high income?
