### Dream: "what am I getting myself into"

Woke this morning with a feeling that doing the "crush it" talk in Argentina that I am signing myself up to be a maniac worker for the next many years.

Maybe I am to some degree, but I do need to deliver value, and this is one kind of value I can deliver.  I still think I can shape the job stay out of many of the weeds, AND get stronger in CV at the same time.


worried about this issue, but I am hopeful I can manage it.

And it is part of an evolving picture of what I can deliver in future jobs too.  My biggest worry is that I will only earn 200-300K at SV but need more in order to retire well.





### 2023-03-01  Mid Week - Different kind of tracking
- Before SV I needed to track that I was getting stuff done each day
- Now I am "running hot" with many actions happening each day
- But not necessarily the most important actions happening all the time
- Idea: track 'buckets' of activity in order to ensure good percentage is going in best directions

### 2023-02-27  Week 2 at SV 

- **EFFECTIVE** - For the first time in a long time I feel like I am being particularly effective with my time.  Why?
	- DELEGATE - I quickly cut to the nub of many issues, so I can delegate quickly.  and I LIKE delegating.
	- FIREHOSE - I like surfing many different issues, and putting bits of high value time against them.
	- CAT - I get to choose which task I will add value, how and when.
	- TEMPO - stuff happening is at a high tempo; it puts me into a high tempo

- **MY VALUE** - I went from feeling insecure in what value I might bring to SV, into a mode where it is clear of the value that I can bring on a sustained basis, and how I am able to "level up" my value, by getting to the top of the pyramid in all areas:
	- Low-hours, high-coverage tracking of ALL of SW Execution
	- Occasional collaborative creation of processes across ALL of SW and ALL of the Company
	- Investor Relations, Fund raising, 
	- Planning/Managing/Execution/Delivery of high value planning, and projects  (e.g. Bridge Round Prep)


I think/hope I can quickly become super time efficient at juggling many balls and have spare time/energy for growth and other things.
Controlling my time & deliveries is key to delivering high value & having spare energy/time

This job is fun, and jobs like this will continue to be fun.

Maybe I supplement this job to make a high income?
