-- mostly judged unfairly, but some parts parts are fair:  Not in the code, velocity, wisdom.
-- really having difficulty putting time into job search
-- At SV I am improving self, and could get value 'getting into code' but its hard & job search
-- SV is not a great long term bet

### j2022-12-11  Discipline for Eli


- You put glue on back of santa, and told Eli to place the card.  he did.  
- But it needed to be repositioned.  Eli watched you fix his placement.
- As you asked him to place the next... he refused.  He just barely touched it after you placed it, to stick it down.

- Then you wanted him to put arms and other tricky things on an already crowded front of the car.  
- We were already loosing his excitement for the cards...  this was a recipe for failure.
- I just wanted to open the card and he could put anything... anywhere.



- You make make multiple dozen decisions for us each weekend.  
- Even if I see a way that seems better I often don't say anything...  Not so critical to do everything in best way... and it simplifies things.
- Sometimes i say an alternative idea, but if it get shot down, more than 1/2 the time I just drop it.  Again not worth a debate.
- But sometimes it does matter.  Then I push back

- I have a couple of ideas (Forum, EduCorp, EOCA, Notester) that I need to get into the world at least a bit.  (Probably not as my paid job)

- Joy for me is a certain kind of thinking/doing:
	- It only seems to happen in limited degree in paid work.
	- It is the working out of details in my head:  Uniform
	- It is a certain kind of careful, completionist, organizing:  Obsidian, The basement boxes  (and pushing it to a certain kind of completion)
	- It is (often save the world) systems thinking: EduCorp, Forum, ElasticBlockChain





### j2022-03-00 - QJ note
As I understand it, there are 1000+ biological-men who can run faster than the fastest biological-woman, so was imagining a future where it becomes normal for a tiny fraction (0.1% to 1%) of non-trans elite athletes to adjust their self determination specifically to BECOME a world champion.  It would not take many folks to decided they had a bit of room in their life for a bit of ambiguity.  The stakes would be high...  millions in advertising etc. and the gold medal title.  And just 0.1% would be enough....

I think both this generation and next generation know what a biological-women and self-declared-women are.  The difference is which of these definitions is given primacy when one simply uses the term "woman."  

I think the next generation will be ok.  I think they will have SWITCHED the default meaning, but since they all collectively understand that "woman" now means "a person who self-ascribes a collection of stereotypical behaviors" there will be no issue.  They will simply have a different term like "biologically female" or such to refer to the physical state of a person.  I think this is a fine situation, and no one will be upset that the definitions are "wrong"

But I also predict no one will try to connect physiologically-female attributes to "women" any longer since it will then be understood that woman no longer means biologically female.  So elite sport designations won't be tied in this way, maternity related, and health related issues will not be tied, etc.

We are just in this weird present state where we have rules tied to "woman" which need to be tied to the "biologically female" category instead.  I predict reality will eventually force that to happen.

### j2022-01-28 - Joe/Deep Advisor


P
I
C




Interesting conversations:
- VCs
- Relevant series A thru C companies
- Matching job titles.
- Good groups to connect with.

Tactical advice (framing self; linked-in; outreach emails)


> It just depends, what you would like to create next in your career and what ypur timeline would be.
> Would you want to be a ___position___ at a ___company/ied___ by ___month and year___?


Joe/Deep,
My long term plan of using my 40+ person consulting company as a lifestyle business has been up-ended by this chance to sell it for a chunk of a fast rising former client company.  It is going to take me some time to settle on my new life path.

Both of you have shown early evidence of helping me gain clairity in comments and challenges to me.  So I am happy to have you along for the ride of me "getting a clue."  But I also respect your desire for me to "already have a clue" so it is also possible that you would tell me to "come back when you can better frame your path."  Both options seem viable to me.


Joe asked:
> Would you want to be a ___position___ at a ___company/ied___ by ___month and year___?

ANSWER:
I would like to be an advisor/EIR at a Venture/PE firm by July-Dec of 2022.


DETAILS:
This is a new and tentative idea.  Prior I had been assuming my options were: (1) be a CTO, (2) join a FAANG, or (3) start my own.  But Deep's advisor role seems spot on; I need to learn directly from those who are doing this job in order to verify this new thought.  Also finding that job sounds like finding a snowflake with the right shape in a storm, but I am game if it can be done!


WHEN:  July-Oct 2022
- For the right opportunity I would bend earlier or later than this window.
- My business sale and company wind-down will be complete by July-1
- Not sure how much I need to worry about looking "stale" if I get hired too many months after this.  Financially I am not constrained in the short run, and I am very productively using this time now, on several life projects.

WHERE:  Reasonably funded activities
- My opportunity cost is a $500K+ FAANG job that utilizes my PhD in Machine Learning.  This is hot right now, and it makes little sense for me to be operating at massively below this rate.  (That said, I am a gambler by nature, so if the expected ROI was large, but mostly built into risky equity, I would do it as long as the expected time frame for payout was not much larger than 5 years.)

WHAT:
- Leading efforts to prototype AI systems with significant technical risk.
- Ideally building a range of AI prototypes.  This is not a hard requirement, but Deep is right on the money, I love to dive fast and deep into hard tech areas that are adjacent to my own expertise.  
- My strengths are centered on rapid abilty to:  
	(1) identify crux to solve;  (2) hire/sturcture teams to solve them; (3) propose detailed technical approaches; (3) eval technical approaches; 
	(4) lead and monitor the prototyping activities.


~
I have a couple of direct connections that are in the venture world, I think my first step is to just talk with them about this idea.  And I have an exploration thread that are not even listed above, so it is going to be some time before my new path becomes clear.

Thanks for the help so far, and looking forward to our next chat!
--Dan

### j2021-07-01 - Notes

WANT FREEDOM -- I to get wrapped up in a Dan project from time to time, and feel I have time to really drive it somewhere.  For the moment, that is Uniform, but later it will be something else.

In the early days, Visio will afford more freedom that Google, or MyCo
Working for AF will provide the greatest freedom.


LOVE DESIGNING SYSTEMS - I will rat hole in working out the details for some new idea for a thing.  What is key is that is it mostly from my brain.  Sure I will research background materials, but the love is the thinking it thru.

FINISH IT - Really want to finish a Dan-thing.  But they tend to grow in size.  Taking the step to launch it gets pushed off.

CEO-DAN - does not seem like the life I want.

GENERIC-MYCO - Could be good lifestyle some distance into the future, but it seems too distant and uncertain to count on it.

MAIN COMPARISON NOW -- Is between MyAttempt and Visio?

VISIO, FLAKIER & EASIER -- I have a sense that Visio could be easier than other startup roles, so I am pulled to it.

IF I DONT GO -
- Spend 1-year hacking; then join google
- 6-months; then BATCO

DanCo(KmCo) - Is likely a struggle since it beings from my interests; over explored space; big platforms win


Actualizing Job - Can I find a paying job that will really resonate with me?



Am I really going to have 15 guys?  doing a friends and family round?


QUESTIONS FOR DOUG:
-- side projects;

### j2021-06-30 - Alternatives

Most Likely:  
-- 1.5y Fiddle --> Google   (-->BatCo, -->DanCo)
-- 1y Visio --> 5y Stay | Google

Top Choices:  Google; Visio; BatCo  ?Scientist  Lesser: DanCo(KmCo) GAI, MyCo
Want: Freetime, IdeaExpansion(API,etc.), TechLead
Question:  ActualizingJob


KMCO IS A LONG SHOT -- KM space is very crowded w big money, and entrenched solutions.

BATCO less fun than VISIO -- except after 4 years?




VISIO > GOOGLE  (assuming money is the same)
	can always leave Visio.   more freedom/time, more ownership, as technical

VISIO > MYCO
	For most CEO roles I will be saddled with lots of work & non-technical work
	Might yield a larger payout, but it will be 8+ years out

GAI trails below others -- less cash.

NO MYCO LIFESTYLE -- The idea that I am going to create new business and grow it  into a Ferris lifestyle biz is not a sensible or likely path.

DANCO BUMP -- Starting from a technical idea I love could give a bump in joy of doing work.  But it would be modest, since most activites and choices would still be driven by customer.

CEO GAP -- I have a gap in being a CEO from a decision making perspective.

TECH > MARKETING -- I love solving hard technical problems rather than hard branding / marketing problems.


GAI SAFETY -- A soft money position; maybe for a year or 2, but no way to live
GAI BUILD IT -- Just be a DARPA PM, or join Google Brain, or Open AI


WHAT I WANT
- FREEDOM
- BUILDING a TECHNICAL thing.
- CTO role > CEO role  -- not as technical.  too much work. can't lifestyle


KEY
- DANCO / DANJOIN -- Built around a 'Dan' idea
- MYCO -- A company that I build
- BATCO -- My company built around customer driven problem

### j2021-05-31 - Nick Text Response
Some bullet point thoughts:

**DIFFERENT SITUATION** -- Before marriage I had 'infinite' time with a growing net worth each month.  After marriage in 2018, I told my brother I was "retired-ish".  With 2.5M in the bank earning the equivelant of a $150K/yr interest salary, and my aim to get AF salary over $100K I figured that would cover things, so any additional cash from other adventures would just sweeten the pot.
==> In this context I was looking for anything of value to do.  Now I am considering what is the _last_ direction I will try.
==> Not saying this was a wise path, just explaining the vast difference in risk tolerance.  I married thinking AF would probably work -- but it didn't.

	
**DEEPLY WANT** -- What is it that I deeply want?
- SYSTEMS THINKING -- I am drawn towards a certain kind of "systems thinking" where I step outside how some problem is attacked today and introduce a very different approach and think it thru at at technical level.  I am compelled to just **DO** this all the time.  This is not the most efficient since each is ambitious and I am generally not in position to execute.  
	==> If I didn't need to worry for income, I would have loved to kick off several non-profit-ish things.
	==> Now making just ONE of these my lifes work would be cool, if:
- MANAGING TECHNICAL EXECUTION -- The other thing I seem drawn to is management of technical execution.  Very hands on, but above the level of an individual contributor.
- DAN IDEA -- There are a tiny minority of ideas which seem pretty unique to me.  Other ideas are interesting but will happen with or without me.
	Thus I am extra compelled by Dan ideas.  These include:
		Uniform (KM or Data Pipes), PopulationProcessor, Forum, EduCorp 


**PERSUING MY INTESETS IN A DIRECT WAY**
- PAST ACTION -- I don't think I have been very strategic in persuit of my interests.  Rather I am always looking for interesting problems to consider, and I consider them at two levels:  (1) pencil paper design.  (2) ground up implementation.

NO TO JASON


Finally I am rejecting the Jason possibility in my mind.  Why?
  
-- LAST CHANCE -- Now is my chance to chase a big idea...  Visio will derail me for at least 4 years, even then I am very flat footed to chase a big idea, since I have not make much money.  It is just saying "No" to any big idea.

-- LAZY -- The Visio path might have a modest 'lazy' advantage.  I would love the freedom to work w/o salary demands, but this would likely not be the case at visio.  Perhaps I could get an extra 5-10 hours per week free from my day job, but being junior at Visio, I could not really drive a strongly unconstrained time.

-- EQUIV TECH TO GOOGLE - I want to work heads down on some technical mission.  Likely I could do this better inside a tech company like Google.  I likely could jump between different ML tasks providing value to them, maybe in a way that would at least rival the diversity I would find at Visio.

-- WATER UNDER BRIDGE - Well partly because it is now water under the bridge, I likely cannot pull out a good working relationship given that things have progressed timewise so far.BACK

### j2021-04-11 - NFT transfer - Atilla discussion
Atilla,
Please treat this idea with care... since it could have value. 
Not sure why I kept thinking about this, but I think I have an approach where NFTs from multiple chains could be merged into a new NFT univers on some different chain:

BIG BACKGROUND IDEA: COLLECTIVE QUALITY -- First here is a big idea (I think).  Once you start having multiple NFT universes, and multiple NFT granting sources, there will be some pressure to not allow just any old NFT into your universe.  The value of the universe will be tied to the average and median value of the NFTs in that universe.  This will be true at both the specific minting market place (vendor) level, and will also be true across the whole market place.  Once there are multiple universes and marketplaces within them, there will be a premium on those universes that have some quality control over the market.  (So this is really a separate thread of thought about how you grade and ensure high quality within your market.  For example, if Barack Obama creates an NFT of his 2008 inaguration speech, that will have much greater value than if *I* create one of his speech.  Self-working mechinsms for ensuring this will have great value...  let me put that aside as a different startup!)  For now, just notice that it is important to the community itself that it control what NFTs get created within the universe.  Trash will pollute!


The basic idea underlying this is that the holder of the original NFT burns that NFT in a way that can be uniquely linked to a new transfer NFT.  I think this mechanism retains the identity guarantees across chains!

~-~~-~
Here is my "transfer of NFT" approach:

CREATION -- First the new NFT universe born, and a community of users form using NFTs created in this universe. 

BETTER -- This NFT universe is cheaper with more features than other NFT universes. (if it were not, why would other WANT to come) 

IMPORT CONTROL -- In order for this NFT universe to maintain is quality control while taking over the NFTs from other universes, it is critical that no one can *fake* the import of an NFT from another universe, but then double spend or such.  (Ensuring valid importation is just one part of that larger idea of collective quality, but it is also required in order for others to trust the transfer of NFTs into this universe.)

IMPORT CONTROL BOARD -- In order for importation to occur from a particular chain, a quorum of control board members (who are big HOLDRs) from the community is formed.  
- Each member must be in a position to execute code on a physical machine that they strongly trust.
- They must stake a large fraction of their coin into an importation contract.
- They publish a staking contract which is there indication that they wish to be part of the board being formed.
- They download the importation computation software onto their trusted machines and the execute it.
- The results of the computation are published on chain in special NFT transfer recepts.
- After a fixed (fairly short) period of time their staked funds are released back to them, along with a reward for participating as a board member.
- An import control board can be convened at any moment in time, but the fees generated are proportional to the number of NFTs that were transferred, so board members may want to wait until enough built up.

CATCHER NFT -- An owner of an NFT in some other chain must mint a "catcher" NFT within the new chain if they want to initiate a transfer.  
- The catcher NFT lists the MAX transfer fee the holder is willing to pay in order to get their NFT transferred.
- This NFT will publish a unique public key in the catcher NFT, but it has no other contents.

BURNING THE NFT -- Then in order to transfer an NFT into this marketplace, the owner of the NFT in the old chain must "burn" the NFT in a verifiable way, and then must associate the burnt NFT with the unique public key in the catcher NFT they created in the new chain.

BOARD FORMATION -- A formation contract can be published at anytime, by any one.  
- It specifies a number of board members, a formation time period, an exeuction period, a holding period, a staking amount per member, an NFT unlock fee amount, and an upfront good faith board formation coin amount in the formation contract.
- The formation contract also specifies all of the import chains and the relevant block height ranges that are to be imported.  So the working zone of the board is precisely defined.
- Socially the community has agree to just ignore any formations that don't have sufficient good faith capital, or per member stake money.  (and maybe there are global minimums)
- Socially these things are generally only created after a group of relevant folks have informally decided it is a good time to run an importation board.
- The community members to creating a staking transaction become the board members, if too many stake, then are random set is derived by hashing all according to a seed derived from the whole set.
- This gives us a random set of HOLDRs that have all stakes alot of coin to be a member.

IMPORT CONTROL EXECUTION -- When the import control algoirthm runs on each board member's machine:
- It scans the defined set of other chains for these burnt NFTs
- Each time it finds one it tries to match it to some catcher NFT in the new chain.
- If if finds a match then it checks that the catching NFTs max fee is greater equal to this boards transfer fee amount.  If this board is asked for higher fees, then the NFT is ignored.
- Otherwise this NFT is added to the growing transfer summary being calculated.  This board member is asserting that the new NFT is the sole match for this older NFT.
- In the case that meta data or other info existed in the old NFT is must also exist in the same form in the catcher NFT, and the board member verifies that this information matches as well.
- Each board member publishes one (or could be multiple tranactions which represent their findings along with a verification hash)
- The board creation agent publishes a summary transaction containing the signed checksums from all board members (or maybe it only needs to be close to unanimous?), and it also publishes the full receipt of all transferred NFT ids.

COMMUNITY VERIFICATION -- 
- INCENTIVE -- According to dans "big idea" all holders of NFTs within this universe have a vested interest in not allowing low quality NFTs into their space.  In particular if forgery transfers are at all possible, then no one would trust transfers into this space, since one could not be sure that later someone would transfer a forgery in, and dilute/destroy the value of yours.
- QUICK CHECK -- Thus at a minium the community can verify that the checksums match, if they don't anybody can run the code and see who is lying.
- BURNING A BOARD MEMBER -- In the case that the community determines that a board member acted in bad faith, any NFT holders who have registered to vote (via special transaction) within the last year (or whatever) can vote to burn this member.
- SUBJECTIVE -- Notice, this is really a subjective decision the board member has staked alot of capital and if they ran the code in good faith, then it would be wrong to nail them.  I think it will be clear if something was part of a concerted plot.  (and it would require collusion of a HUGE number of board members, and the entire NFT community to be aleep at the wheel)  Thus one really does not need to burn a board member unless you are pretty darn sure they were up to no good.
- BURNING -- If a board member is burned...  there stake is literally burnt -- it is not transferred to ANYONE.  I think this will never happen, but I worry if it is transferred to anyone, there will be some incentive to use this vote mechanism to steal money from honest members.
- 4 OUT OF 5 VOTE -- In the case that a board member really tries to cheat it will be so obvious to all, one can compute what they should have generated.  So if there is any question that they didn't mean it, we can not burn them, and the whole system is not really at risk. 
- LARGE STAKE -- I think what really ensures honest execution is having large HOLDR stakes at risk during these times...  no one is going to be lax about their computer's security at this time!  (but getting large stake requries that HOLDRs feel confident that even if something were to go wrong, the community would not harm them if they intended no harm.)


UNLOCK -- A transfer NFT contract is unlocked once a board with sufficient staking funds has concluded that the transfer is complete.  This can be computed directly from that summary transaction.  Notice the genesis transfer NFT lets you know how much money was at stake when it was minted, and how many board members etc.  So there is a measure of its strength.  Still I think the whole NFT community will want to require certain miniumums for certain transfers.  (perhaps this will vary by the general values found on different chains.)

PAYMENT -- Each NFT transfer has a unique index starting at zero within the summary transaction. Part of the execution of the unlock for a transfer NFT is the payment of ONE of the board members, their board participation fee.  If 'N' is the number of board members, then the NFT index mod N indicates which single board member this NFT unlocking should pay its unlocking fee to.  So if a board is convened with fees that are too small, it might be hard to find willing board members.  But it one waits along time so there are many NFTs to be transferred, then the price can go down.  


So that is the system.  NOTICE:
- What is cool is it does not place much of any constraint connecting the two chains.  Not even a shared hashing function is required.  
- One just needs a verifiable way to burn an NFT in the source chain, and
- needs an unambiguous way to associate the burnt NFT to a transfer NFT, but this could just be the TXID or ACCOUNT id for the NFT... really every NFT needs a unique handle of some kind.
- Notice this could really be used over and over to transfer NFTs in an ongoing way.
- It could even be a continuous transfer mechanism, but I think one would need to work out a way to pay on a rolling basis.
- Notice the board member fees are paid out according to what the formation contract states, so if a board is convened with a low transfer fee, HOLDRs might decide it is not worth their effort.
- Still on rare occasion one might form a board with a very low transfer fee.  this would catch those stingy transfers that were willing to wait for this rare event (which would eventaully have large value since it would be scooping up many NFT transfers that have been created over a large range of time.)
- Notice there is no danger of overlapping board formations causing duplication troubles.  One can only burn the source NFT once!  And the owner of the private key that signed the burning transaction is the only one that can create a valid transfer NFT matching it.
- As an advanced trick we could allow duplicate transfer NFTs, this would allow one to change details about the transfer (like fees) after doing the burn.
- NOTICE:  Being a board member would require one to verify that NEVER in the history of the NFT universe has this NFT been transferred by any prior board.  I can think of some adaptations that could make that not require unbounded memory as time move forward...   I think the trick is each transfer frame should only have an ending height not a starting height.  that way you could just keep track of the last board summaries and what heights they already covered.



ok... it was kinda rediculous to write this up.
but fun.  (I have not re-read it, so I am not sure how clear it is)

talk more soon!

### 2021-03-04 - The Nick and Dan LLC Model

	- WILDERNESS -- We venture forth into the wilderness of OPP (other people's problems)
		- IDEA FUNNEL -- Each sees many a wild and weird thing, most are of no use
		- CONJURES SOLUTIONS -- Many imagined solutions are spoken of to see if anyone will listen.  If excitement is found then he digs further
		- VET -- Still in the wilderness working only with quill and papayrus each vets and discards many dozens of these half ideas seeking a gem.
			A gem that will pay for the efforts of the expedition a 1000 times over
		- GEM == An idea w/ strong market signal & strong vetting (biz model etc.)
		- SUPPLIES -- The expedition will travel light a bit of admin time, and maybe some coach time... can pull them from his money or not worry about it.
	
	- BRINGING IT HOME -- What happens next depends upon the gem found:
		- AF CENTRIC BOOTSTRAP --
			- AF PROTOTYPING -- performed for equity at full freight rate with reasonable market cap (e.g. 3M or such)
			- AF EQUITY SPLIT -- AF equity for prototyping is split 50/50 and given directly to founders. (need to work out legal details on this;
				probably done @ low rate as loan w. low interest.)
			- BOTH FOUNDERS -- aim is to have both be founders, but each would eventaully need to have substantitive roles (see hold door)
		- AF CENTRIC + FUND RAISE -- 
			- Same picture as above, except AF fraction likely to shrink.  
				Still additional equity expected based on each person's role too.
		- NOT AF CENTRIC -- Then company is built and filled it with founders and such, the aim is for both to be there, but both have to have roles.
	
	- HOLD THE DOOR OPEN -- In general whatever happens the advantage to being a team is that each can lean forward on the exploration of an idea, still allowing the other to jump in later if an idea really starts taking off.  Thus for a limited time the idea is that the 2nd founder can still "jump in"

### 201x-xx-xx Karen Email  



Karen:

Tonight's conversation was just aweful.  And it was all over the place.  At one time
we are deciding that we are not going to kiss anymore, at first very playfully said,
then later forcefully with anger, then ending saying that I had not choice in the matter
you were definitely going to be kissing me tomorrow.

I don't think it was thought out on your part, and I think it comes from conflicting
ideas, and trying to push things, but not push things too far.  It did not feel good,
and it lowers my respect a little.  But still not so far, not so bad.
I am old enough to know that things don't always line up, a very good catch, can 
have some notable issues going on, and still be a good catch -- still work out well in 
the long run.  We were all over the place, indeed we have been all over the place everytime
this issue can up.... except the the very first moment.

In that first moment, there was raw fear on your face, and there was vulnerablity
in your eyes, and you said, "I don't know if I should push you away"
That felt totally honest, and painfully vulnerable.....  I respect that.


Still like I said, I expect the person I am with will have some baggage....  I expect
that there will be 'homework to do' in getting to a great place -- indeed all of this 
"stuff"  feels like stuff that wont matter so much if we are dating exclusively, so I 
try not to let it affect me too much.


But I am quite bothered by this nontheless -- not about the awefulness of this nite,
but about the where it leaves things:

- I like you.  I like being with you.  I like teasing around with you.  I am super 
  comefortable being with you.
 
### 2013-01-30  --  Quit working at paybygroup???

Currently in a loose-loose situation

LEAVE BECAUSE
-	DON’T LOVE – Don’t love this business – There are other ideas I do love (bit crazier ideas though)
-	AM LAME – Fede is gonna run rings around me.   (should verify this first)
-	œ
-	WRONG PATH – not wise career move to become excellent here.
-	NEED BREAK – burned out, need break.
-	GEOGRAPHY – wrong geography to find mate.
-	LOOSE-LOOSE – if we loose I loose, if we win team fires me
-	EXCITEMENT – just not excited about PBG (4 sure), and am excited about beyond (mirage?)

STAY BECAUSE
-	IRREPLACABLE – I don’t have the dev skills to get another founder job on that basis.  Must be my idea.
(but I guess I don’t want another dev founder position)
-	


CONSIDERATIONS
-	LEVEL – Is this startup of higher quality than what I could do on my own?
-	LONG HAUL – if I don’t want for long haul – then leave now; since wrong path & diming chances
-	OP-COST – six months to home away



SHOULD STAY 
-	If we make it – but prospects dim


DO I WANT TO DO THIS FOR THE LONG HAUL?
- Not really since tech problem is mostly not fun, and mgt is not mine
- Would be different if I were directing things?  Eh, not so much.  Would be interesting to win key engagements, but not just driving a BD pipe.

ARE WE GONNA MAKE IT?
-  Ok chance to get homeaway


- kinda don’t want leave this open, cause I don’t want them to get me to stay.



===========================
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- I wanted to be with someone a bit younger, who could have kids with me.
  If I am totally honest with myself, I also just imagined being with someone a bit
  younger generally.  
  
- Still this is just a general feeling, not one that I would be ready to act on at all.
  Indeed, the idea of just being open to what happens with us, seems nice.  I am open
  to the idea that not only am I super comefortable in your presence, but other 
  ways of being compatible will happen too.
  
- Indeed I feel that it is healthy for me, to be intimate with someone.  Two years is
  a long time.  I am lonely, and a little unbalanced by wanting contact _so_ much.
  So it is good for me to be with you, and maybe something more can come from 
  us.
  
- I am very open to building on this area of strength between us, and seeing
  how else we might fit together.  If is good for me, like water on parched earth.
  It is _fun_.  and it is wonderful.
  
  
  
  
But after tonight, I feel like I just don't like you enough....  maybe someday I would
like you enough, but I now wonder if it is even possible to date.










### 201x-xx-xx  Karen  


Karen:

I wanted time to try to hear what my heart is saying...  I have the sense that all of these
words can tear us apart, but still want to be true to myself and to you.

First things, about trust.  There is no way a person can be the one who tell another that
they should trust them...   that is also what an untrustworthy person would say too.
But if trust _is_ a critical issue here, then we must find a way for you to get that.
I am trustworthy.  PAINFULLY trustworthy.  so much that it causes me to make a mess out of
things as I have done here, by erring on the side of explicitness, just to avoid miscommunication
and to avoid unfairness to you.  Still if having greater trust would help things here, I dunno
I have lots of close friends who will laugh at the amount of trustworthiness in me, I am sure
they would be amused, but happy to tell a random person they don't know in CA about me.


But I do think there was real reason for me to speak up in the car.
I am proud of myself for having done so.  No one could ever accuse me of not being
correct or honest, had I simply let thing move forward on the path they were on.
But for me to gain from our relationship, at your expense, would be a wrong thing, even if
no one could ever blame me for it.  This is not who I am.


For me, what we have matters in two ways.  I am a social/intimate creature.
I miss sex, but there is no pain in my heart, without sex -- it is not critical.
But there is real pain, that I am not emotionally close to anyone.  These days with you
have been super wonderful.  I feel like a cactus, after drying in the endless heat of 
summer dry spell, now finds himself soaking in a torrential downfall.  It is glorious!
I love the presence of you, probably more, since it feels like forever since I have felt 
that spark in me, and in our touch.  But it is also about you too.  I don't think I have
ever been with someone so electric in her reactions to me.  It is all just wonderful!

The second way you matter is that you could be my partner.  I don't really have much thought
about that yet...  after our 'interviewing' it is clear that there are some important issues
to figure out, but we don't have to have them all figured out now.  There are lots of other
things about how we are with friends, and in lots of contexts besides smooching.  



Since that speed dating thing, I did go out with the Japanese teacher.  (A SAC, and
also very child-able and child-focused person.)  I wont go out with her again.  There just 
was not a connection there.  Still after being locked into relationships for most of my 30s
half of my 40s, I will not feel good to slide into another long relationship with a whimper
rather than a bang.  And I can tell if we start dating it will be long -- at least if it is good.  it will take months
for us to really get to know each other -- that whole time, I am wondering if I jumped too
quickly.  After all those years, a decade plus if you count both prior women, I am with 
the first girl I kissed?  I will think ``did I choose wisely?''  and I won't know the answer.


Now if we continue on, and over time it becomes clear that what we have is not something
I have with others, well that is a completely different picture.
But it is equally clear that jumping to that now is a disasterous path for me, and for us.




Still for me, spending time with you is an awesome thing.  For both reasons above it is just
great.  I think it is not healthy (or fun) for me to feel such a gap in intimacy.  It will
always be a half way thing, until I know I am with my life partner -- but still not having it
I fear can lead to me making bad choices.  And on the second thing, the only way to findout 
about the rest of you and me is to be with you to see.  There is the chance that being with
you I will get attached -- I will, and I already am.  Then _you_ wlll be the one who does
not want to continue -- because you found another, or simply because I am not the one.  I 
have felt this pain very directly and am not looking for a repeat performance.  Still overall
there is more positive than negative for me to continue seeing you -- romantically, or even 
more as friends holding romance in check.  I do want our intimacy, and I do want to see where
this all leads to.


But not at the expense of you.  It makes no sense to swim in the intimacy of you, and be
hurting you at the same time!  There is always the chance of real hurt, of course.  
Indeed if there is no chance of real hurt, then there is no real connection either.  So I am 
not so naive as to think I am get very close to you, and not take risks (for either of us.)
Still these should be risks that we are both ok taking.  And the risks should be somewhat 
equal... the power between us should be somewhat equal.  It cannot be you waiting to see
how things turn out ....  I also have to been looking to you with similar feelings.
This is what seemed like trouble in the car, and it is why I opened my mouth.

I WANT there to be a way forward, I WANT more of what we have!  but somehow in a context
where you don't feel 'shitty', and also where in addition, it _is_ a good thing for both
of us.









### j2010-12-17 – LESSONS FROM DATING ELAINE

lesson

- I could not face the conclusions I was coming to.  So I did not.  but I also did not act.

- My expectations (rules) about how this should be froze me away from breaking up, and away from marrying.  neither met criteria, but by sheer force of will I imagined I could change one or the other.  Or at least fantasized that I could (Even thought at another level I expected I could not).

### j2010-10-00 – Gave up on Siege

It occurred to me after our phone call yesterday, that ours was one of the best business relationships that I never had.  I was worried early on, based on the comments coming from STO, but I have found them to be quite groundless.  There have been several times when it was clearly in your best interest to simply let things ride along w/o comment—after all you were getting effort for free.  But you (or at least your wife) took it upon yourself to be explicit about assumptions being made.

In the end, it turns out that integrity is one of the most prized attributes in close partnerships.  Many folks believe they are operating with integrity, but integrity is not defined by your actions when there would be consequences, it is defined by those rare moments when there would NOT be consequences.  I think you have the right stuff to lead a successful organization—and for the kind of business you are shooting for—it is so critical that folks *want* to work with you, to trust in you.

I think early on you were really ready to open up to significant sharing.  You pushed for something safe for both of us.  Later you conveyed our lowering sense of opportunity in a good, open way.  Several times being explicit about it—all good stuff.  From my point of view this time was well worth it.   I really did put quite a bit of mental energy in this direction, but it pushed me to think about my time post DARPA, and gave me an inside look at starting my own gig.

In 20-20 hindsight, I would have played the game of the last year a little differently.  Playing around with SBIRs was probably not the right game.  Given that you were already in motion the night we first spoke, and I was mentally quite far from leaving DARPA, I needed a “shoot the moon” as a strategy for catching up.

I needed to pitch work (white papers) that were generally separate from your current thrusts.  It is hard for that to work, since you would still be the one shopping those papers around.  Still it was really what was needed.  Winning work off of such a paper would be the basis for a quarter of Siege.  Winning a SBIR even two, would not qualify.  Especially if you have Joe doing the same w. little equity!  It just doesn’t add up.

I am not quite sure what to make of the fact that I did not even manage to achieve this lower goal.  In a certain sense it was a partial test, there was never enough riding on a SBIR to merit putting in sustained effort.  Still, it makes me question if I am too far from cyber to play that game.  I don’t think that is true.  My belief about AI+cyber is essentially unchanged.  Still it does give me pause…

At this point I think I am too late to get enough of Siege for it to make sense.  I do plan to continue down this path of pitching a Cyber program (at least if management gives positive signals).  If I do move in that direction post DARPA there may be some way to share equity across two inter-related companies which affords the right up sides for both of us.  I don’t know, but I am open to it.

In the end, I am convinced that you are the kind of person I would trust to work with—I would want to work with.  I am also convinced that the world is more win-win than anything else.  Whenever possible it is better to pool resources rather than going it alone.  So who knows, I don’t see the way forward right now, but I would be looking for that way forward.

Best luck with Siege!

### j2010-10-09 – Organizing Self

FOCUS – I can do many different things, but I jump from idea to idea way too quickly.  
- At DARPA there are so many efforts that have never gone anywhere, but I never ran into a wall, I just got working on something else.
- With Jason/Siege I never put the work in necessary to join siege, but still put much work in.
- In my research I have jumped from place to place

MAJOR TASKS
- NewStart
- Mgt MR/BL
- Admin
- NextJob
- Decision
- Fun


MY RESEARCH FOCUS – Teachable systems
This is consistent w. my work from: IBM, from BL, and Cyber or ISR.

–  work @ IBM

### j2010-04-01 – Life is moving faster

There is much less time, than I am pretending there is.  But less that needs doing as well.
- Need to ensure that the important stuff is getting done.
- Need to ensure that each day is lived the way I want it to be lived.
- Need to be strategic in leveraging my activities.  Too often I build the first half but don’t reap the benefits.

- Need to be strategic in spending time.  I kill too many hours in less than effective ways:
   Meetings/calls that take too long.  Getting to into the details.  Procrastinating.  Piddling on small stuff.
   Working on tasks that are not the most impt.

- Days must have space & periods of fast activity.

- Should have few activities in each bucket, then keep coming back, so each activity is pushed to a place of value.




BUCKETS OF ENERGY
Project – personal “fun” projects – these can also have other value but must be fun.
Career – Pushing my career forward – beyond my day job
Work – My day job
Spiritual – Spiritual growth
Family&Friends – Paying attention to those that matter
Mate&MyFamily – D 
Self – Health, Finance, Possessions, Capabilities

PROJ:  TightKeys, ConfigTool, ?jason?
CAREER:  Jason, Pubs, StartupContacts, 
WORK:  Fewer more focused hours.  
FAMILY&FRIENDS:  Just a bit of time from time to time
MATE:  Make a decision
SELF:  Pretty on track.  Focused hours

### j2010-03-18 - Siege no
Don’t want to join Jason now.  Most specifically I would rather be at DARPA now, still have stuff I want to do here, less change allows me to focus on Elaine now, and would rather shoot for product company than consulting company.

But don’t “see” product company yet either.  Would jump to product company if I saw a viable product with viable path.  Indeed, I would jump to Jason’s company too if I saw a thing to build.
### j2020-03-00 Siege maybe
Short-term targeted thinking:  Is there a syverson product to create?

Decide Jason fast.   (If yes, path is clear)  if no, then:

·       MR+BL;  Work on transitions; Global ISR

·       Push toward Cortical:  write up;  seedling;  program

·       Explore Startups

·       1-tech event every other week.

·       Weekly hours refining / creating startup ideas

·       Push best idea mostly rapidly toward decision point

·       Teach self / connect self / find partners

·       Explore Mainstream Jobs

·       Present at leading places: Google, SRI
### j2010-01-02 – From last year’s retreat  (12/2008)

RETREAT

- Samati tips   (extracting feelings & others)

- Value of depth?
  - Centrality of the body experience now

- After 5 months what do you personally believe
  * Life after
  * souls connected 
  * loving presence (beyond the psy effect)



Pat,

This is Dan Oblinger (or Dan 244 as known on the retreat).
Thanks much for your sincerity and energy on the retreat, they helped set the rhythem 
of the retreat for me.  I don't know what it felt like inside yourself, but to me
I felt a calmness and clarity that I attributed to your recent 5 month adventure.
I think it was a great gift for all of us, to receive you so close to your period of 
intense study.




I wanted to thank you for the retreat.

### j2009-12-19 - personal update
Things are not great.  I am at a place of very low motivation.  
My current situation is reinforcing some habits that are not great:
No movement with elaine… by having big ideas, but no progress (just putting stuff onto lists), 
Expending the energy to *do* into doing small things (clean house)
Cant break free of existing commitments long enough to hit bottom and take new course, whole weeks are going by, where I am just exhausted in the evening, and only put off anything … everything till the next day…. When it all happens again.

Will attempt new habit:  Morning Default

### j2009-11-22 – Joe Laconti


* Idea of a building up model spirituality from observations from stmts scientist would accept about world (social world)

* Self Enrichment reading group

* your spiritual drivers / goals / life goals

### j2009-11-19 – Progress

TIME & PROGRESS
•	Life is structured so I often don’t get time for the most important personal things
•	Worse yet, I am biased away from such thinking/activites
•	More still, I don’t really have a plan when I do get time, so it is frittered easily.

I have the sense that even when I do get time, it gets spent w. little consequence.



RESOLUTION – When personal time is available:
•	I need to organize what I most want to get from the time.
•	Around that I need to build a plan.
•	I need to spiritually ground and connect my reasons for action.
