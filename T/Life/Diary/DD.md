**Set 2: Identifying Triggers and Noticing the Body’s Signals**

1. **Scan for Physiological Responses**
    
    - Anxiety often first appears in physical sensations (e.g., tightness in the chest, racing heart, restlessness).
        
    - When you notice these sensations, pause and label them: “I’m feeling tightness,” or “My heart is racing.”
        
    - This simple act of labeling shifts your brain into observation mode instead of panic mode.
        
2. **Identify the “Spark” Events**
    
    - Triggers might be internal (thoughts about an upcoming deadline) or external (a tense conversation).
        
    - Make a habit of asking, “What just happened?” when you feel anxiety rising.
        
    - Jot down the event or thought that set off your worry response.
        
3. **Notice Environmental Cues**
    
    - It might help to track patterns in your environment: places, times of day, social interactions.
        
    - For instance, you might see that morning emails trigger stress, or that certain social settings spark anxiety.
        
    - The clearer you see the trigger, the easier it is to apply mindful awareness.
