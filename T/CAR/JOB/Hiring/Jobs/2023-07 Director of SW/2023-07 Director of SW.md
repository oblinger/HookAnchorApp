NICK
- carefully define role

**HIRING**: Roles? Your Process?
**SHIPPING CODE**:  Outcomes?  Scale?  Your Role?  Num Orgs?
- Web / Mobile?  Algs?
**MANAGING**:  Org size/structure?  How do you monitor your team's execution over time?  Went wrong?
- Proj Mgt?  sizing?  like it?
**TESTING**:  Design?  Went wrong?  Fixed?  (Ask about our case)
**ARCH/BACK**:  Most complex?
**GOALS**:  5-years?  best-org/role?
**PHILOSOPHY**:  How to lead?

- EXPERIENCE: 	Largest Owned, Hired, Shipped
- PROCESS:		Testing (who/what); 
- MGT: 			Style tasking team,
- DEV:
 
STAR = Situation, Task, Action, Result  =  Situation, Timing, Action, Remedy

Design a good push to production schedule.  Various kinds of testing you want, staging etc.  front end & backend separate.
  breaking changes on APIs.  DB table changes.
How to encode a DAG into a table (tree w/ multiple parents) -- allow quick inheritance checks

# CANDIDATES 14=5+9

## 2023-09-19  Ignacio Larranaga

English: quick and fluent, but with a strong accent some of the time.
- break down in understanding words happened.  but less over time.
HONEST: several time he hesitated as he tried to make honest estimates and volunteered negative info.
ORG-IDEAS: he has lots of ideas about how orgs should work at low level.  (not sure how great, but cogent)
==> Modest experience in many top-shelf places
==> Modest experience building new orgs and new things
==> Most experience tracking at pretty low level
==> Talks a good game, but fewer results to point to
==> LOW-LEVEL:  Still hacking/prototyping.

It went ok.  he does not have the experience leading larger teams, but its not too, too far from what we are looking for.  he has good energy.  he also has not really been part of many success stories of building orgs or running products... he has been more a consultant team lead doing dev.  his biggest experience was in a context with already well defined processes so he was just doing is part in a larger org.  BUT I would not rule him out yet.  I want to see how things proceed with my to leading candidates right now.

=LG=PROJ=
- Only one big.

CROSSOVER - Aurea - Jive. (Acquired by ESW)
- VP - Approx 15 under him.  2-3 teams 
- Marketsize - 1,500 clients - e.g. Redhat
- SIZE:  Biggest customer 10K active users, couple of hundred simultaneous users.  (?? 100K total)
- Jive = platform (an internal platform)
- Features he added: Video, transcription, subtitles
- 6 months for that project.  (but worked 3 years on Jive projects)
- HIS ROLE:  Usually he creates a team solves problems, and hands off the project
- SCOPE:  this was an internal team for solving problems
- Strong SW processes 
- complex clouds of clouds.  (but core SW was rudimentary)
- WEEDS - He gets into the weeds on the architecture.
	- easier to explain with code rather than words
	- "reduced whole system into synchronizing lists of data". what is the core of the problem
	- asked to him:  "what is the best way?"


HEALTH ADVISOR - 
- was CTO. hired 4 devs, 2 QA 
- not a great success
- but built from scratch.
- needed to find product market fit.
	- idea: create community product.  pivot: physicians can offer services.
- SIZE:  spikes during campaigns - 200 simultaneous users.


=CODING=
- Was always coding.  (even in crossover he codes a bit)

IDEA SOFT
- 1 year project
- Java development
- Created from scratch
- Built time series simulator platform

- 6 months
- JS-reacts

CROSSOVER

=CREATING=RUNNING=PROCESSES=
- Crossover is where he learned best practices
	- TRACKING:  Weekly google docs with Key highlights (status of the whole team and projects)
		- Reporting up to CTO.  and down to eng
		- communicate with sub-managers using the doc itself to (brings idea of being in same office)
		- very low level org tracking to ensure velocity
	- TRACKING: I am tracking teams are making expected process.  
		- Looking at a couple of dashboards --> copy numbers into weekly doc
	- metrics:  tracking story points during sprint
	- Tracking current sprint, and next sprint
- Idea:
	- "you need to activate parts needed solve issues. but get rid of parts of processes that are busy"
	- "need eng mgr to create reqs doc since he needs to know what is being built"
	- "cut to the chase.  less talking and more action"

DOUBLE NINES - consulting agency - working for coop.com
- Dir of Eng
- uber clone for trucks
- TEAM: 20 devs, mgr, 4QA
- Added
	- Requirement Doc.  ("I am in favor a asynch working") -  <2-pages

		- example:  UX of security roles managements.  
	- Hiring.  they already had. 
	- Story tracking. "I am a guy of metrics" 
	- Tee shirt sizing
	- Created a flow in Jira to manage bugs.
	- Problem capacity per sprint: inaccurate capacity estimates because devs are in different 
		- SOLN: complex google sheet to compute capacity.
- ==>  Not alot of creating... org was created.


TATA CONSULTING SERVICES - 
- not really good examp

- Push to production takes until 2am.  
	- Testing before push to production
	- Add automation (cypress) to tests
	- add tests at time you create code.
- "in favor of infrastructure as code". (way I was working at crossover)

=PERSONEL=
- Eng Mgr is directly responsible
- Trigger: metrics shows one guy had released nothing.  
	- Talked w/ mgr. --> individual fixed
	- Manager was not technical enough to understand this was slow.


- Tracking Remote Devs
	- I am looking at points numbers (and look at the task itself)

## 2023-09-28  ++Raul2

As per discussed on the phone, these are the questions from Raul:  
- What are the expectations around this role when it comes to high-level management (manager of managers) vs active day-to-day detailed management of engineering efforts?
- Which kind of managers, tech leads, or other types of leaders will report to Raul to rely on? (Current or to be hired)  
- What is the current structure of the engineering organization?  
- Which roles are already present?
- What short term hiring efforts currently underway
- What is the current process around product ideation & product roadmap prioritization? Who are the people involved?
- I set expectations with him that he would receive answers in a call or via email.


-- testing, code quality, dev quality, low level processes (push2production)
-- market analysis
-- detailed feature design
-- manager of leads (but still in the scrum, still directly leading)


- does not think it is an ideal match (first reaction)
- not great ratio of partime vs. fulltime.  
- at Axion I was managing 3 teams at a very low level.  
  (but even there the teams were more)

- One side of the mismatch:
	- wants to be a leader of leader, not a first line.
- Can do the low level management well, though does not do that
- 25% - 75%


## 2023-09-01  ++Raul

- Huge API; 50M request per min.  7EC.  2quarter zero minutes downtime.  13 minutes downtime in quarter before.

LEAD EXAMPLE
- Prioritize & Estimate
	- list of things to build (1-5 size) 1, 2-3d, 4-6d, 1-2w, 2w+;  uncertainty: H/M/L;  simplicity
	- gets down to days (factor for seniority of person)
	- Tell me why you are seeing this sizing?  then drill

- Testing
	- product testing: works w/ prod analysis & QA
	- How to you track this?  ProdBugs / QA-Bugs ratio should be low.  also if you 
	- can tell if regression test are good if it shows edge and non-happy paths
	- he asks:  how could we have stopped this bug.

- Push2Prod
	- He did not need to do (and admitted little experience here. +1)

- Planning
	- Saber - no product defined, lots of uncertainty.
		- Several weeks and no decisions on any key decisions - Analysis Paralasis 
			- He took a weekend and thought it thru himself.  he scoped and made decisions & asked tech team
			- then asked business team if super light weight system out quicker.  

- Underperformance 
	- Happy Ending (@ Exacta) sat with Dev in the code.  Was not attitude problem; was K problem
	- Un-happing Ending - (@ Saber ) had expectation he was better than he was.
		- wanted to be promoted.  Miscommunication where he tried to take. 4months.
	- Happy ending (@ Mercado Libere) 
		- FAILING:  In charge of PII, not nailing alg requirements, when he was on call he ignored on call alerts.
		- He was too sloppy for the for this key role.
		- Guy was working well in less demanding part of company; maybe can use this guy.
		- Do you want to try leading another team?  yes.  and it worked well.
		- 

- Tech trouble - he need to deep dive - time zone synchroniztion 
	- @ Mercado; 
	- Need to segment data by country (data compliance, etc.)

		- had conversation:  not ambitious w/ product goals.
  
- Hiring - king pin backend guy
	- currently the head hiring guy for his group.
	- What I am looking for senior guy?  
		- CS Algo ideas; Knows about design;
