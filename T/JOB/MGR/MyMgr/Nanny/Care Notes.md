### BABYSITTING QUESTIONS
CHECK:  Reviews.  Costs.  |  HowFar.  Availability/Duration.

- Where do you live?
- Do you typically have availability on Saturday mornings?
- Our typical rate is $25/hr.  Does that work for you?

Thanks, I looked at your profile and we seem like a good fit!  A couple more questions:   We live in Bernal Heights, where do you live?   We often have need on Saturday mornings, do you typically have availability then?  And how many months into the future do you think you will be doing occasional nannying (e. g. is this very temporary or is this a longer term activity?)

Thanks for writing, hope we can work together!  --dan   (Qingling's husband)


Our typical rate is $25/hr.  Does that work for you?
And more generally what is your availability for occasional nannying at other times of the day and week?   (e. g. do you have a pretty constrained week, or are you usually able to work?)

### EMAIL INCOMING TEMPLATE

, thanks for writing to us!  Tell us what you are looking for:  hours per week, times of day, and for how long (weeks/months).  And I should tell you this is really a combo position... we have some cooking/organizing around the house on one side, and playing with Eli (our son) on the other.  We want to keep a comfortable tempo, so the more Eli going on, the less of everything else.  Does that sound right to you?  In the past what kind of cooking have you regularly done?  Any kind?  Also your profile doesn't have a lot of reviews, how long have you been doing child care, and is there another person/place where we can get a review from?  Thanks.

### EMAIL OUTGOING TEMPLATES

, nice to electronically me you.  We are looking for a new friend in our house, both as extra pair of hands to help at some times, and as a care giver for our son at other times.  Looking at your profile, you seem like a great match for all of that!

Are you available for recurring part time work now?

~-~~

Tell me a little about what you are looking for:  What days and times are you wanting to work?  And for how long?  (weeks/months/years?)
You listed cooking in your profile, what kinds of cooking do you do now, and how  often?
and your profile didn't have many reviews, where have you been working in the last years?  can we get reviews from there somehow?

looking forward to hearing more...
--qingling and dan
