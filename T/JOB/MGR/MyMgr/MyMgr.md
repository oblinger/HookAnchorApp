Nick,

I have told Mike that:

(1) his first priority is any personal tasks I give him generally.
(2)  But on each day he is generally still doing 4-hours per day of work for Aeolus no matter how many hours of personal work he does for me.
     (He can let Aeolus work slip from at most one day, if I really task him a lot personally, but no more than that one day.)

— He should alert us if the 4hrs per day is not enough to keep up with Aeolus work.
— We can increase those hours if needed.

### Info
#### Instructions
##### Lightening Responses


POLICY:  WE EXECUTE LIGHTNING RESPONSES
==>  Dan requests  ``Just drop all and do it immediately''  
==>    as long as an item will take less than an hour, and no PRIORITY task will be delayed.
==>  100% of the time it is (1) done in an hour, or (2) an explicit deadline is agreed upon.

WHY?

(1) Often the handoff is incomplete, and then the whole logistics of getting the info and doing the task can balloon in complexity.  
(2) Saves all the overhead of task tracking etc.  
(3) It removes the issue of even determining its priority or deadline since it is done now.
(4) It remvoes the issue of the task not getting done in time.
(5) It removes the complexity of me tracking that it gets done.  (for both staff AND Dan)
(6) It removes Dan operating in the future NOT KNOWNING IF IT IS DONE.
(7) It removes the step of explictly acknowledging that the action was done.  
    ==> 100% of the time it is (1) done in an hour, or (2) an explicit deadline is agreed upon.
(8) This reduces context switching in Dan's head, since as soon as he thinks of an issue, he can say it, and forget it.  No tracking/organzing/etc.


THE COST
Of course this DECREASE in DanO context switching comes at a cost of 
INCREASING context switching in the (poor) staff that must put up with this pain in the ass behavior.

But overall for the organization (and even for the staff person) the many benefits above 
to have alot of value, so that is why we do it.
