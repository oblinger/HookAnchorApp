### --- Customer Acquisition (from nick) ---

1. Data gather to understand what they want, & what we are working with
2. Agreeing on a destination (formal or informal design or other definition of success criteria)
---- if got agreement on what is important to accomplish ----
3. Give them a super informal sense of the size (eg: "1-3 eng months-ish") & ask for permission to create a detailed plan for estimations
---- if got permission ----
4. INTERNAL: create PDD --> create estimates --> translate to cost
5. OUTWARD: have a call with them to review & socialize the cost
6. make any edits to the plan/estimations based on their informal feedback
---- if got verbal agreement that proposal is on the mark ----
7. deliver proposal via email



# Personal Growth

### Ideas from Joe on management

personal growth

-- Approach.  Say ``I want keep this moving, if I have a soltion that is not busted, I'd to move with,
   but if there are show stoppers, then let hit those now.

-- <1min talk

-- Acknowlege w/o saying BUT



-- Come into a meeting with a strawman.  
   Make it clear you are not arguing for it.  Rather just offering it as a strating point.

-- Have discussions w. expressed intent to DISCUSS but NOT to DECIDE
   -- then later describe decision (you can explain it might not account for all ideas, but seems best for now)
