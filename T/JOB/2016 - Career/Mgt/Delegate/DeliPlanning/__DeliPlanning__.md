### Proj planning notes for Vik and Steph

Super cool.

I am getting a little lost in the state of each of the sub goals, and it might also help you ensure no key goal is lost.
Here is a thought for an over view….. see if you like it.



Y	Q3  	COURSE STARTED — Be in execution on a single remote counseling class
G	AUG20 	INFRASTRUCTURE — Have all initial infrastructure in place.
Y	???		PARTNER — Have agreement signed with partner who can supervise


Y	AUG20	INFRASTRUCTURE 
G	AUG15	ZOOM — have zoom account.  have tried it.  have ‘operations’ room setup for doing the class
G	AUG20	LEGAL — have legal docs that need to be signed ready.


Y	SEP-1?	PARTNER
G	AUG5	talk with Joe smith
G	AUG7	talk with sally sue


-1- The prefix is R=red  G=green   Y=yellow    D=done
this is your own assessment of the risk of a milestone.  For anything that is red/yellow you should try to make it green, even if you have to push the schedule out on an item (as long as it does not cause something else to become yellow/red.  then that is an ok solution.

-2- try to have dates, but they might be fuzzy:  e.g.  Q3…   

-3- Try to name groups of things like “INFRASTRUCTURE” — this lets you focus on the forest and the trees by grouping and giving targets for a whole group.

— my idea is that you commit to dates and such, but then this becomes a live document, you keep editing it to keep track.
— Try to keep it to two levels of details…  for planning purpose it is too complex if you get much deeper.

(Of course you have a separate todo list for tracking small things, but this is a planning document so you see at birds-eye-view ALL that must be done.)


what do you think?  seem easy to do, and valuable?  any edits to the idea?


Cheers,
Dan
