# Quick Points
- AEOLUS:  Hired 60+ over 40 PhD.  >130eng in dep.
- DARPA:

### DARPA CALCULATION
BL:  $15M/yr.  2 teams + BlueTeam 
MR:  $25M/yr.  3 teams.  $8M/prime.  13 profs.

$4m internal.  $300K/person = 12heads
$4m / 12profs per prime = $300K per prof.
      4 people = 10% one prof.  1-postdoc.  2-grads

MR Prime = 12 + 48 = 60people x 3 primes = 180heads for MR
BL Prime = 50heads (little smaller). 20 on Blue = 120heads for BL

We were managing ~300 heads when both BL and MR were executing.


# Recent Job Summaries

### Analytics Fire -- Founder -- 7/2013-present
- Built 50+ engineer consulting firm focused on AI in the clean energy and medical device spaces.
- Our teams have built solutions that manage billions in assets and are currently controlling hundreds of thousands of devices in the field.
- We have developed reserach prototypes like Sunpower's Instant Design which combine latest resarch in geometric-constraint processing, machine vision, deep learning, and GPU optomization, and translated it into a production system which they are rolling out now as a primary new channel for sales into the consumer solar market.

### Aeolus Robotics -- CTO -- 10/2016-06/2018
- Lead the development of the software for the Aeolus Eldercare Assistance Robot, and delivered this widely noted prototype for presentation at CES.  (Prototype is also the basis for an ongoing relationship with a largest keretsu in Japan, where it is in service in their elder care facilities.)
- Created and lead the hiring team which in turn hired 60 engineers out of over 15,000 applicants (most within a 9 month window).  We hired over 40 with PhDs, many in very targeted sub-disciplines: robotics (grasping, haptic control, etc.), vision (skeletal tracking, high frame rate feature tracking, etc), machine learning (deep learning).
- Established an Aeolus research group within a world-leading grasping research center in Vienna.
- Helped secure $10M in funding from Jafco among other leading investors.

# Bragging Materials
### Hacked something to my advantage

- Convinced my linear algebra teacher that I should not be scored on my homeworks but only on my
  test results.

- Later used his open-ended test taking policy to save my GPA, by staying over an entire night and re-deriving 
  two required lemmas that I would have known had I actually done the homework.

  (ok, so my second hack was really more of a painful recovery from the consequences of my first hack.
   still in the end, I got my way, and saved my grade.  Wise?  no.  but hacked, yes.)



--- Most impressive thing built.

 - the IBM Jeopardy Playing Computer Watson.  (Ok I didn't build it, but I conceived of and executed
   the 150+ million DARPA program mapping unstructured text onto fixed ontologies -- which is the core 
   tech the IBM used to beat Jennings)

Something directly coded by me?
Personal Wizards -- A learning system that induces executable scripts with loops, branches, and variables 
based on "watching" a desktop user (by trapping & abstracting messages at Windows event layer).  
This is now part of an IBM Rational product.


Built solely from my own two hands?
- A full screen LISP debugger that allows user to both fwd and backwards in time and up and down in abstraction.
