### 201?-??  Ideas from Joe on management

personal growth

-- Approach.  Say ``I want keep this moving, if I have a soltion that is not busted, I'd to move with,
   but if there are show stoppers, then let hit those now.

-- <1min talk

-- Acknowlege w/o saying BUT



-- Come into a meeting with a strawman.  
   Make it clear you are not arguing for it.  Rather just offering it as a strating point.

-- Have discussions w. expressed intent to DISCUSS but NOT to DECIDE
   -- then later describe decision (you can explain it might not account for all ideas, but seems best for now)

### 2016.08 -- Discussion w. Aaron @ Google
When a CEO is brought in to Google they are often start at a Director level 
or a Level-7.  It is rare for people to come in above this.
~------
EXAMPLE:  Ex. Facebook   Eng. director  (To Run "growth" for search)
$5M in euqity  over 4 years             (he accidentally forwarded this to team)
$350K base salary.
$1.4 total comp.
~------
Aaron  (Level-7)
non-execut  key product sera
$275 + double 
Total Comp $750
~------ 
Director  (closer to million+) or 
one level below  level-7 (as aaron)  
~------
Dev level below Aaron
$225 ($400 total)   non-phD.  senior Dev.
~------
Normally Dan would come in at below $500.  Then yaers to go up the ranks.

### 2010-03-18

Don't want to join Jason now. Most specifically I would rather be at DARPA now, still have stuff I want to do
here, less change allows me to focus on Elaine now, and would rather shoot for product company than
consulting company.
But don't "see" product company yet either. Would jump to product company if I saw a viable product with
viable path. Indeed, I would jump to Jason's company too if I saw a thing to build.

### 2010-03
Short-term targeted thinking: Is there a syverson product to create?
Decide Jason fast. (If yes, path is clear) if no, then:
• MR+BL; Work on transitions; Global ISR
• Push toward Cortical: write up; seedling; program
• Explore Startups
• 1-tech event every other week.
• Weekly hours refining / creating startup ideas
• Push best idea mostly rapidly toward decision point
• Teach self / connect self / find partners
• Explore Mainstream Jobs
Present at leading places: Google, SRI
