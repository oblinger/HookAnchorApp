On a forward looking basis, I am tempted to add a single row the the data sheet called “Other owners”

The idea is to try to understand what other people besides the candidate had ultimate responsibility that their enterprise site was stable and functioning.

Many candidates may have been senior developers on a large enterprise site, but they were not really the one with the “buck stops here” responsibility that the site was stable and always up.  To vet this I think we just explicitly ask the candidate who else had such responsibility, then in discussion we can understand the particular role our candidate had relative to those others.

I added three such rows. 47,48, 49, that can be used for upto 3 major system they owned.

what do you think?

### 2024-09-10  Hiring FAQ

XXXX,
The following captures info that we have sent to our existing recruiter about this posting.
It is edited it into a kind of FAQ for this job posting so you have all relevant info at your finger tips.
We would like to expand our search to include another recruiter.
To start with perhaps we can give feedback on a couple of candidates that you propose and see if we are going in a good direction.

More than any other requirement this person needs to have been the one primarily responsible for multiple enterprise applications. l
So filling in the details in the experience section of the spreadsheet is most important for each candidate.

Thanks,
Jasu

THE ROLE:  Lead Backend Developer.

We have a new job requirement, and plan to begin interviewing as soon as candidates become available.  This is an important role, so we plan to perform interviewing in batches as they come in, but then hold off for some weeks in order to be sure we have found a best candidate for the role.

This person will replace our key backend developer to become our chief architect, and the the chief "owner" of the integrity of our system.  They are the "buck stops here" person when it comes to all technical aspects related to the design and execution of our back end application.  We have node.js on the backend as our primary language, though we will expect this person to be proficient across a range of relevant languages.

If we were to boil this role down to a few aspects it would be:
(1) Years experience "owning" enterprise applications
(2) Proficiency in architecting and developing all aspects of the backend of an enterprise app.
(3) Some experience leading others as part of this owning of the system.  (ideally as team lead or manager)

Below is a job posting for this job.  Let me know if there are any questions.  Later I will share a tracking spreadsheet for use.  (feel free to edit the structure of that sheet... it will just be a starting point.)

Thanks,
Dan


NOTES ON THE SPREADSHEET
- we added some detailed fields in the document for the experience section.  A prime focus for this job search is centered on the experience in owning enterprise applications, so provide room to explain their top three enterprise apps they OWNED and the size of those apps.   Size might be number of active users, amount of revenue, or number of devs working on it (if pre-revenue). Usually these three top enterprise apps will be from three different companies, but it is also ok if the same company is listed twice if they did two large things at one place.
- The leadership section may better apply to some candidates than others, it will include all kinds of leadership.  Scrum Master, Tech Lead, Manager, etc.  We want to capture most important two roles they have had.  (the experience owning enterprise apps is more important than leadership, but both are desireable)
