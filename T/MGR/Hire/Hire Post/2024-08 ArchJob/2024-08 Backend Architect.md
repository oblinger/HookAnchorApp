### 2024-08-29  Spreadsheet

Silvano,
Thanks for the first candidate.  

SPREADSHEET NOTES
I took the time to create a folder for info about the candidates you find, along with a tracking spreadsheet for those candidates.  Here are some details about it:
- I know that you may not want to share all contact info for the person until we have scheduled an interview, that is fine.  Please just be sure we have (1) Linked-In, (2) Resume, and (3) Job experience especially before we have that first interview scheduled.
- I added some detailed fields in the document for the experience section.  A prime focus for this job search is centered on the experience in owning enterprise applications, so provide room to explain their top three enterprise apps they OWNED and the size of those apps.   Size might be number of active users, amount of revenue, or number of devs working on it (if pre-revenue). Usually these three top enterprise apps will be from three different companies, but it is also ok if the same company is listed twice if they did two large things at one place.
- The leadership section may better apply to some candidates than others, it will include all kinds of leadership.  Scrum Master, Tech Lead, Manager, etc.  Want to capture most important two roles they have had.

### 2024-08-26  Salary

Here are further details:

GEOGRAPHY
Geographically, we would prefer candidates that are in the Americas if possible (mostly LATAM, less ideal is Eastern Europe).  Finally, proficiency in Spanish is a bonus but not required.

SALARY
Based on the search we did last year, I am expecting to find suitable candidates in the range of $6-10K/mo USD.  We are price sensitive and will aim to the lower end of this range if we can.  Still the candidate must have solid experience owning enterprise apps, and must be a strong developer.

COMPUTER
We typically do not provide a computer for our employees, but we have done this in cases where it was needed, so it needed we can accommodate.

VACATIONS
We provide holidays that are aligned with the country where each employee is located.

CONTRACT DURATION
There is no predefined duration for this contract.  We hope this person become very central to our business and stays with us for many many years.






### 2024-08-26  Note Explaining The Job

We have a new job requirement, and plan to begin interviewing as soon as candidates become available.  This is an important role, so we plan to perform interviewing in batches as they come in, but then hold off for some weeks in order to be sure we have found a best candidate for the role.

This person will replace our key backend developer to become our chief architect, and the the chief "owner" of the integrity of our system.  They are the "buck stops here" person when it comes to all technical aspects related to the design and execution of our back end application.  We have node.js on the backend as our primary language, though we will expect this person to be proficient across a range of relevant languages.

If we were to boil this role down to a few aspects it would be:
(1) Years experience "owning" enterprise applications
(2) Proficiency in architecting and developing all aspects of the backend of an enterprise app.
(3) Some experience leading others as part of this owning of the system.  (ideally as team lead or manager)

Below is a job posting for this job.  Let me know if there are any questions.  Later I will share a tracking spreadsheet for use.  (feel free to edit the structure of that sheet... it will just be a starting point.)

Thanks,
Dan
