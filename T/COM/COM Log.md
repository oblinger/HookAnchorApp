Wayne,

We both have PhDs from the University of Illinois and are both developing novel LLM-based technologies.  
Indeed, this is how I found you.

I have been thinking about the upcoming product iteration when (I believe) AI-assistance will become so commoditized that it no longer serves as a strong product differentiator.  In that world, who can win?

It may be those companies that can offer greater context to their AIs.

I am not selling anything, and my thinking is not worked out on this, but it seems companies like Workato could be in a unique position to have "collective AIs" that leverage context derived from interactions across many people working at a single company.  It's tricky, as the context window for most LLMs is still small; figuring out what context to use will be challenging.

If you have time and interest in a quick Coupa cafe or phone chat, that would be great; if now is not a great time, I understand that as well.

Best,
Dan Oblinger
CTO SportsVisio
