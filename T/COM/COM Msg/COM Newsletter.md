- Achieved an 8% error rate at assessing which players are on court at each moment in the game. This is used in two ways: First, to deliver player-minutes (a standard statistic indicating minutes played in the game per player). Second, knowing the player on court supports advanced statistics about how team performance improves with each player on or off court.
- Users associated with a team now receive an LLM-driven succinct & enthusiastic write-up of the game’s action and key insights after every game.
- Developed an algorithm that adds a flaming fireball visual effect on top of a player’s highlight clips. We are adding this visual effect to the SportsVisio app as a way of increasing social sharing. Production rollout expected in Q3.
