## NOTE 1
Sam, 

Here is a rollup of our July hiring.  Given the costs savings possible, and our existing heavy investment in Spanish speakers I am starting there as my prime focus for all roles.

Still I would like to expand beyond talent cross for sourcing roles, so love any pointers you have.  With our first Angular hire (who did not stay with us) we had very good luck in creating and using a paid hiring test.  This shifted who we made offers to, so I think it was very informative.  Not sure if I can manage to get such tests created in time for the backend person, but I would really like to.

I spoke with Juan yesterday, I think we are good for pushing his offer price down a bit, Brian is making an offer today.  Excited about this hire as he is both front end and backend, so he can do angular for 2 months then switch towards the backend to support our backend lead. 

Attached are our job reqs for Backend and Angular.  In my opinion we should be moving aggressively on the hires listed below, still I also feel that SV has felt "behind" from its very start and thus willing to cut corners.  I think the Sapphire money (and time) gives us the ability to stop operating in this way and to begin demanding excellence in action.  Beginning of course with excellence in hiring:
- Working with Scott and Brian we developed a test for Angular devs, and this shifted who we made offers to last month I think in a good ways.  We used this same test with the current crop and I think it adds value.  I feel good about our process here.
- Today I outlined an Architect's test for our backend person, we should have that done next week.  We should get many more candidates into our pipe thought we already have two.  I would like to figure out how to also do coding testing or at least validation with this candidate.
- I think the head of SW role is so critical for our company, getting it right is the different between execution and stalling in the next two years.  I think it is worth some back and forth emails and/or discussion between the three of us to get the key requirements for that role nailed down.  I will kick that off shortly.

CURRENT OVERALL HIRING GOALS
- ANGULAR - Would like a full time "anchor" person in the team, we would like to hire someone as close to MikeF is capability, but full time and remote.  We don't need a superstar for this role, but this person is our anchor front end architect and code quality reference.
- CV PRACTITIONERS - Because we have made progress on the hard task of Player Identification I feel we are better served getting "worker bees" into the team that cost less and are experiences with CV algorithms but do not have a PhD.  Eventually we want to hire two CV "worker bees" into the team.  The idea is to replace Vishal with two people for about the same cost as Vishal.  Mike is tasking Vishal with some specific items before giving him notice (which should be happening before Friday next week).  Since we currently have 5 worker bees, this is a less pressing need, we plan to drop to 4, then hire two more as we find great candidates.
- BACKEND - One backend/architect hire.  The needs for this Scott replacement is clear: strong backend + architect + customer focused designer.
  They need to be able to collaborate with non-technical PM to drive product spec forward.
- SW LEAD - This is a high level position that is a combination of Senior-SW-director, Senior Technical Project Manager, VP-ENG.  
  Our current plan is to lean this hire towards a more senior TPM skill set assuming the senior backend person we hire is able to lead the SW team personnel as well as be its architect. Else we lean more towards a Senior SW manager / VP-ENG.
  No job spec for this yet, but below is our list of core competencies for this role.  Getting this hire right will make or break our next two years of execution.


CURRENT PROGRESS
- ANGULAR - We are on the cusp of making offers to two angular devs.  We are getting a second one as both are good, and one can "switch hit" and do backend work too.  This will allow us to burn thru a backlog of Angular debt, but then switch towards backend as we currently thinkg the company will be shifting majority of focus towards the mobile app in Q4, and this will require some backend support.
- BACKEND - We have just received our first two backend candidates, they both seems plausible.  For me this is a key role, I am happy to unlock some backend velocity with our second hire above immediately, but I don't think we are moving ourselves forward if we don't find a full Scott replacement, so we need to really assess well here, both in testing the candidates AND looking hard.  To serve our needs they need to be a full Scott replacement.
- CV PRACTITIONERS - We have no candidates as yet, I am adjusting older job posting to include a search for a more ML-ops candidate, and will have that job posting by end of week to share.


KEY BACKEND NEEDS
- ARCHITECT - Able to drive the technical decision making and APIs that underly our system.
- CUSTOMER FOCUSED DESIGN - Able to tightly collaborate with the product owner, product management, and UX designer to serves as the backbone for that team in producing workable product solutions. Especially given our current team make up, it is critical that this person be able to bridge the needs as expressed by non-technical vision holders and create beautiful and workable user experience flows that our design & SW teams can then implement.
- SYSTEM OWNER - Our anchor backend person is ultimately responsible for the stability of our entire system.  The running instances as well as our SW processes.
- BACKED SW DEV - This person serves as our anchor dev on the back end.  So their code quality and velocity are both important.

## NOTE 2

Sam and Jason,
lots of thinking about the key roles of backend and SW lead.  Perhaps too much to try to communicate in written form.  For my own clarity I have written my thinking, you can read it or just decide to wait until we talk.  I have spoke to Jason about this already... happy for a three way call (or not) as you guys see fit.




FINDING THE BEST SW TEAM LEADER

THEIR SKILLS SHOULD COMPLEMENT MYSELF, THE NEW BACKEND PERSON, AND A POSSIBLE SENIOR PM HIRE
- The key aim is to cover leadership responsibilities that Brian should be covering now, as well as shift many responsibilities away from me so that most of my day to day energies can shift into the technical details within the CV team where I add the most differentiated value.  Experience has shown that detailed attention there is really needed, and it can sometimes lead to break throughs.  
- SW Team Lead role is LARGE.  If the backend hire has experience leading scrums (quite likely), this may free the head of SW to focus more on project management aspects of "keeping trains running on time", project sizing, etc.  But this can only work if we can also elevate TT to be team lead for front end mobile, and a new Angular hire as team lead for web front end.  And have other back end support too.  But this structure might be workable, and we could potentially test it with Brian still here.  
- If this offloading towards backend approach fails, then we probably need to make TWO key senior hires:  A SENIOR SW LEAD hire and SENIOR PROJ MANAGEMENT hire as well.  Ideally we avoid this prior to the a-round as it is just adds so much to our burn rate!

CONSUMER-FACING APP EXPERT
A second key aim is someone who has extensive SW leadership over consumer-facing products that achieve significant market impact.  There are best practices in this area that neither I nor any others on our team have experience with, and we NEED this experience.  I am bringing us (slowly) to the point that we will not just fall over when we have regular customers, but I cannot bring us to excellance -- this is just not in my wheelhouse.  We must hire it in this person.

STARTUP PERSON
Ideally this hire has significant leadership experience within successful Series-A thru Series-C companies. I want to see someone who has created many lean outcome oriented processes fitting into the looser "wild west" of early stage products like ours.

HIGH MOTOR 
This person must be a "high motor", high velocity, "break things" kind of person who adds urgency to the whole team.  Such energy cannot always just come us three at the top, it must be very strong in this person.

LAT-AM HIRE
- Ideally this person spends the bulk of their time interacting with our backend and front end SW engineers getting into the technical and logistical weeds with them.  Ideally >80% time.  Thus being a native Spanish speaker and in time zone with his team is of great value.
- Further each key hire that we can shift southward will make a huge impact on our burn rate, and the A+ talent in this category really can command $500K+ even in fly over states in the US, even with big equity that is usually still above $250K.  Of course our challenge will be finding that talent in Lat AM at any price.  Still it is such a massive triple win for us: language, timezone and price, that we should really struggle mightily to do it.  ESPECIALLY if we are talking about making TWO key hires, this single dimension of our choice becomes company altering.


TECHNICAL SKILLS
- SW DEV SKILL - They need to have been a SW dev at some level at some point.  Still they probably are further from the code today, and if they are more a PM type, are leaning more heavily on the architect (and me) for that part of the job.  If they are more SW Director / VP-ENG type then they are still strong in that regard.  Either is acceptable depending upon our backend hire.
- PROJECT MANAGEMENT - They must be excellent in project sizing, scoping and planning.  Still if we also plan to make a second key hire as a senior PM then their skills in planning (think GANTT charts) could be significantly less.  
- TEAM MANAGEMENT - They need to have significant experience managing teams directly and managing team leads too.
- SUPPORTED ROLES - I will help with these items, still they should take over the bulk of the time and effort needed:
	- SW PROCESSES - They should be excellent in creating, correcting, and tracking of a wide range of SW processes
	- HIRING - They should have strong experience in building teams.





A second aim is to up our game with someone who has specific experience in technical SW leadership in the context of a Series-A thru Series-C consumer-facing SW company.  Having deep experience in this specific context will allow them to level up our game beyond where I can get us to as that is a very particular and demanding SW delivery context.

If our Senior Backend Architect has many years in leading team scrums, then perhaps the SW lead can shift towards the technical project management, product management, process tracking side of that equation.  If our backend architect is less of a leader then our SW team leader will need to be scrum leader as well and this will need to be more of a straight Dir of SW role or VP-ENG kind of role.

Either way then need to have been many years in startup leadership delivering con


I think our Backend Architect could cover the deepest levels 


move the ball forward (put intended I guess).  To do this we want a SW lead that can shoulder many leadership responsibilities.  Here is what I see as most critical:


UNMET SW TEAM NEEDS
- PM - PROJECT MANAGEMENT - Very seasoned decision maker:  setting priorities, structuring effort & deliverables, tracking many efforts.
- HIRING - Along with the CTO this person would 
- ARCHITECT - 
- TEAM LEAD - 


CENTRAL REQUIREMENTS
- 5+ Years experience in senior technical leadership delivering consumer facing products within a series-A thru series-C startup.

- 2+ years of experience hiring, leading, and growing teams.

- Proven track record of shipping production quality consumer facing software.        through your team that utilizes and builds on top of cutting edge machine learning technologies.

## NOTE 3

I wrote up a quick summary of the key requirements for these two roles for our collective consideration.  My sense is that we have three critical gaps in our current team:  
- Jack is too junior to serve as senior project manager, 
- Scott is a complete failure as part of a design team, 
- Brian does not serve as a high level leader (developing processes, proactively attacking problems)

Presently I am covering for the latter two gaps at a moderate level.  We have turned the corner on bug tracking, task tracking, and I hope soon on testing.  Still this is taxing, dragging me away from the CV team, and even if we turn all these corners, it will never yield excellence.

But should this be two hires or three?  If the backend guy is also a good leader, then our Director of SW can shift more toward Project management, and be the guy who ensures that all trains run on time.  If instead all of our SW leader's time is spent in technical leadership of a 10+ person team, then we will need a senior PM to keep our trains running on time.  Jack is great because he understands our product, but he is simply out of his depth in trying to plan at a company level, he is a great side kick but that is all.

I am worried both about the workload of replacing brian as low level scrum lead, senior management of developing processes, hiring, etc. AND project management (which is a heavy workload all by itself).  If our backend guy can support these roles significantly, then two hires can work, else it really is really three jobs.  The only thing is, I really don't want to increase our burn rate much at all.  The CV team will nail this problem, but it wont be quick.  Thoughts on these hires?





My question is
