SimplyHired and Indeed are both popular job search platforms, but
they differ in features, usability, and effectiveness for job seekers
and employers.
Overview of Each Platform
• Indeed: Launched in 2004, Indeed is one of the largest job boards
globally, with over 250 million unique visitors per month. It aggregates
job listings from various sources, providing a vast selection of
opportunities for job seekers. Indeed allows employers to post jobs for
free and offers sponsored listings on a pay-per-click basis to enhance
visibility.
• SimplyHired: Founded in 2003, SimplyHired is a job search engine that
aggregates listings from various job boards and company websites. It
allows users to search for jobs and post resumes for free. However,
SimplyHired requires employers to pay to access candidate contact
information after narrowing down their selections.
Key Differences
1. Job Listings:
• Indeed has a significantly larger number of job listings compared to
SimplyHired, making it a better option for job seekers looking for a wide
range of opportunities. * 2
• SimplyHired may have fewer listings but focuses on providing detailed

- How to Write a Cover Letter — Step-by-Step Tips & Examples
- https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-write-a-cover-letter.html

Apparently didn't copy link for this one
You're looking to personalize your cover letter generation with a custom GPT model, which is a fantastic idea! Here's a breakdown of how you can train a custom GPT to write cover letters in your specific voice and style:
1. Data Collection and Preparation:
Gather Your Materials: Collect all the job descriptions you're targeting, your resume, and, most importantly, all the cover letters you've previously written. The more cover letters you have, the better the model can learn your style. Aim for at least 10-15, but more is always better.
Format Consistently: Ensure your cover letters are in a consistent format (e.g., plain text, .docx). This will make it easier for the model to process them.
Clean and Organize: Review your past cover letters. Are there any you're not particularly happy with? Remove or revise them. Also, look for recurring phrases, sentence structures, and tone. This will help you identify your preferred style.
Create Training Data: This is the most crucial step. You'll need to pair job descriptions with the corresponding cover letters. The custom GPT model will learn the relationship between the job requirements and how you express your qualifications in your cover letter. A simple way to organize this is:
 
Job Description 1: [Text of Job Description 1]
Cover Letter 1: [Text of Cover Letter 1]
Job Description 2: [Text of Job Description 2]
Cover Letter 2: [Text of Cover Letter 2]
...and so on
1. Choosing a Custom GPT Platform:
Several platforms offer custom GPT training. Look for one that allows you to:
Import your data: The platform should allow you to upload your training data in a structured format.
Fine-tune the model: You need the ability to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT model with your specific data.
Control the output: The platform should give you some control over the generated text, such as temperature (which affects the creativity of the output) and top-p (which controls the diversity of word choices).
1. Training the Model:
Upload your data: Upload the training data you prepared.
Fine-tune: Start the fine-tuning process. This will take some time, and the cost will vary depending on the platform and the size of your data.
Experiment with parameters: Experiment with the different parameters (temperature, top-p) to see how they affect the generated cover letters. A lower temperature will make the output more predictable and closer to your existing style, while a higher temperature will make it more creative (but potentially less consistent).
1. Using Your Custom GPT:
Input a new job description: When you want to generate a cover letter, simply provide the new job description as input to your custom GPT model.
Review and edit: The generated cover letter will be a good starting point, but you'll likely still need to review and edit it. The model is learning your style, but it's not perfect. Pay attention to:
Accuracy: Make sure the model accurately reflects your skills and experience.
Tone: Check if the tone is consistent with your desired level of confidence (not arrogant).
Specific details: Add any specific details about the company or the role that the model might have missed.
Iterate: The more you use the model and edit its output, the better it will become at generating cover letters in your voice. You can even add the edited cover letters back to your training data to further improve the model.
Tips for Success:
Quality over quantity: Focus on providing high-quality cover letters in your training data. A few well-written examples are better than many mediocre ones.
Be patient: Training a custom GPT model takes time and experimentation. Don't get discouraged if the initial results aren't perfect.
Iterative improvement: Treat the model as a tool to assist you, not replace you. Review and edit its output, and use the feedback to further refine the model.
Privacy: Be mindful of any sensitive information in your cover letters and ensure the platform you choose handles your data securely.
By following these steps, you can leverage the power of custom GPT to create personalized cover letters that reflect your unique voice and style, saving you time and effort in the job application process.
   =================================
Here's some of what I've learnt (want to write a Medium article eventually)
(1) To get seen (recruiter, hiring mgr):
- for recruiter, they need far less jargon except for key words/tech - de-jargon by getting someone outside your field to tell you what doesn't make sense
- apply within 24-48 hour rule 
- be active on LinkedIn -- possibly best way is to make postings that large # impressions. I believe a reposting with your comments counts (not sure if it counts for same weight though)
- get rid of fluff in your LI profile/resume, keep it to 1 or 2 pages, focus on job titles and even change previous job titles if it helps (you need job titles that are the same as the job title you are applying for)
- TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf
- How to Get Hired When AI Does the Screening
- resume 
   - at least 3 ways of finding metrics (how many you did, magnitude of project you worked on, number of things achieved/magnitude of contribution or change made as a result)
   - use active verb of larger achievement, rather active verb of what you did (
- pair up with someone who is working on their LinkedIn profile in similar field and read both profiles while critiquing out loud (I was surprised at how useful my JSC buddy's comments were)
- networking - answer recruiters quickly, they have a short attention span and are overwhelmed

#### Compensation

------
		GOOGLE COMPENSATION
		Yes for Egnor because he's pre-ipo and senior staff.  I'm 2 levels down, post-ipo with total comp 250-300 largely due to favorable stock growth.  
		Spector is one of a dozen senior vp's.  He's in a whole different league.

		But if I'm your peer you're off by a factor of 1.5-2.  Similar to me are many ex-IBMers with 20-30 years of experience now at google .
		Consultants don't get health coverage and related benefits.  Also it's a limited term opportunity.  So many reasons for higher rate than google rate.

		A newly hired director (like senior staff but mgr) might get base of 300 with 1M of stock over 4 years.  So cases exist but you're 
		talking about 10% of your peers not all.

		Happy Hunting!
### Doug - compensation question
		------
		HIGH END CONSULTANT COMPENSATION

		This is such a tricky question.  Everyone I have asked it of has told me it is tricky, and managed to evade actually quoting any numbers. I'm not going to do that. 
		The conventional wisdom is that you shouldn't be looking for a daily (or hourly) rate, you should be making value-based proposals.  Propose some work, then price it by value.  For yourself, estimate the effort it will take.  You are then correctly incentivised to figure out how to economize on the performance.  I get this answer pretty much every time I ask the question. 
		In my own personal experience, I beg to differ.  I have made proposals where I am able to compute pretty well the amortization schedule of the work I am proposing (by comparing the costs of the outcome vs. service offerings in the marketplace that they would need to engage to cover for not having had the word done up-front).  While this schedule was accepted, it was way out of budget (by about 6:1!).  So no deal.
		I currently have a small contract that I am doing on this basis. It has taken months to organize it (I have been tracking the business development time, so I can calculate my actual costs).  Even considering all that, I was able to quote  a price that undercut my competition while providing me with an effective hourly rate that is very good.  But I'm not sure that it is really that much better than quoting a time-and-materials hour rate. 
		So, on to numbers.  TopQuadrant has registered with a GSA schedule, which means that their service fees are now a matter of public record.  Their top fee, which is the PhD working at the level that their experience and education merit, is $250/hour (I might be off by a few $ here, I didn't look it up just now, I'm working from memory).  I have found that that rate makes most people balk.  I have also heard from some of TQ's partners in large projects that their rates are known for being high.  
		So - as I negotiated with the bank for my current gig, I ended up at $180/hour (which is going through a contracting house, so they actually pay something like $200/hour).  I have been told that if I get a better offer, to come back to them. I haven't done that.  Keep in mind that this rate is one that I get for 20-40 hrs/week for the course of several months at a time, so I am getting a lot of stability at that number.  
		So, there are the parameters - I'll let you figure out your numbers from there.

### Chronology Of Notes

		  * 16.09.14 -- Cory question
		Cory,

		a question about PhP salaries.  I am starting to look for people for my photo editing idea.
		Really I need lightly skilled folks to do basic photo editing.  Would not even need
		a bachelors degree, but perhaps I am better off looking for folks who have that background?


		For people in the manila area, who have a bachelor's degree, but who are NOT currently 
		working in a good paying job.  What hourly rate would be the lowest I could try to charge
		and still get people who were reasonably good, and reasonably responsible?

		what would be a standard salary for a person w. a bachelor's?

		what would be a good salary?

##### 13.07.31 -- Next projects

		BRAIN2 -- Get funding work two years to produce demo system
		- Sources:  DARPA, 

		CONFIG -- as a side project in Google.
		- Could I build and 'own' some core concept of config
		  prior to google.  Then work on an open source version while
		  at google?
		  - OWN the 'github' server -- the primary default one used by lang
		    and the only one that allowed to be a market place.
