I am beginning a job search and would like to build up a list of relevant companies that fit my experience (as listed in my attached resume) as well as the criteria I have listed below.  For each company you identify, please provide your assessment of each company against each criteria as well as a summary of the evidence you used to arrive at that company's score on each criteria.

## CRITERIA FOR AN IDEAL COMPANY
#### **LOCATION**: Bay Area or Remote.  I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and want to work most days from here.  I am open to some travel but want to be based here.
#### * **PAY**: Total comp above $300-500K.
#### * **INNOVATIVE**: The ideal company has many deeply technical AI projects.
#### * **ASCENDANT**: The company is poised for notable growth in the next years.  At the very least, the company should not be flat, stagnant, or shrinking.
#### * **GOOD CULTURE**:  Ideally, this company is known for having a great corporate culture that is loved by its employees.  At the very least, I would consider it a notable negative if the company had a reputation as being toxic, cutthroat, or sweatshop-like.

#### * **FOUNDATIONAL MODELS**: A company gets "extra credit" if they are investing significantly in building foundational AI models.


## CRITERIA FOR AN IDEAL ROLE (AS FOUND BY CONSIDERING PROJECTS / JOB POSTINGS SEE AT FOR THE COMPANY)
#### * **AI-RELATED**: I have a PhD in AI, and want to be working in a role that notably leverages this background.
#### * **CUTTING EDGE DEEP LEARNING**: Ideally, the role will involve cutting-edge AI building upon the latest algorithms in deep learning and/or involve novel AI algorithm work.  I would like the work to be as close as possible to being research in AI, but the job should not require recent academic publications as mine are quite out of date.
#### * **TECHNICAL**:  My activities on a day-to-day basis should be deeply technical.
- My work might include mentoring or brainstorming with more junior engineers on how they might approach aspects of their problem-solving exploration.
- Additionally, I enjoy API work, novel algorithm development, and brainstorming ways to apply AI technologies in novel ways to solve difficult tasks.
#### * **LEADERSHIP**: The role should leverage my management experience to have a larger scope and pay. Still, I prefer more hands-on technical leadership rather than more people or project management aspects.


## CRITERIA FOR IDEAL PROJECT.  (AS FOUND BY CONSIDERING PROJECTS / JOB POSTINGS SEE AT FOR THE COMPANY)
#### * **GROUNDBREAKING**: Ideally, my team's project is breaking new ground at a technical level such that the correct approach is not known as the task is so new that an established body of practice has not yet been created.  Our team is making its way on this first-of-its-kind product by trial and error.
#### * **PROTOTYPING**: I enjoy and have the most experience building first-of-a-kind prototypes. I have less experience and interest in scaling up solved solutions for mass adoption.



#### * **COHESIVE PRODUCT:**


- AI-RELATED:  I have a PhD in Computer Science specialized in Machine Learning and would like to use this in doing AI work closely related to the recent revolution in deep learning.
- CUTTING EDGE BUT NOT PURE RESEARCH:  I am most 
- SF BAY AREA: I live in San Francisco and prefer not to relocate, so a job choice needs to be consistent with this.
- I am interested in doing cutting-edge applied AI work.  
- but it has been too long since I was publishing, so it may not be feasible for me to get a pure Research position.
