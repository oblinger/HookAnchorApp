Spoke with STU.  A CEO who just raised $ 50 M.

- I talked too much about AI when they are not focused on it.
- ASK MORE, ASSUME LESS IN MY QUESTIONS
  I should have asked them more about where they are before asking a question with built-in assumptions.
	- Assumed they were not as far along as they currently are.
	- I should have learned the most state-of-the-art in drones first.
	  (I did not realize they already had drones in service with automation)

ISSUES
- Too much about AI
- He said I "Touched on" HW - 



Stu, 

I enjoyed our chat and love Seneca's mission! 

By the way, on the topic of SW reliability and team structure, I agree with your sense that the team needs to be cohesive. Still, spinning up subgroups with decoupled deliverables can significantly increase velocity and output; this might be worth considering if consistent with your velocity / burn-rate tradeoff.

In Seneca's case, one might productively spin up a simulation and modelling sub-team whose deliverables were a sequence of incrementally more comprehensive simulations of the product.  As each becomes mature, it could be folded into the development and testing steps for SW and HW.  The upfront costs of the simulation work are high enough that you want to avoid having the core team work on them or try to use them before reaching a certain level of maturity.  Still, if money is available, I would begin that work in parallel, as it will have significant, immediate value on SW development velocity once it can be performed entirely in simulation before on-device execution.

I'm happy to chat with Nick at some point if getting a more technical read on me would be valuable.

Best, 
Dan
