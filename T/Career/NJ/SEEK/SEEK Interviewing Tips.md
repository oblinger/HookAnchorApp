### 2025-08-06 -- DSA 

Interview process changes. The formats of DSA and system design interviews


Recent discussions among hiring managers and candidates suggest that the **structure of tech interviews has evolved in the last few years, but the core formats of data‑structures‑and‑algorithms (DSA) and system‑design interviews remain fairly stable**.

### How DSA coding interviews are structured

- **Goal and evaluation.** Coding interviews still focus on your ability to solve algorithmic problems efficiently. Companies expect a strong grasp of data structures, algorithms and problem‑solving techniques. In Google’s coding interview, for example, candidates “may be asked to solve coding problems on a whiteboard, online coding platform, or through shared code editors”[preplaced.in](https://www.preplaced.in/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-google-technical-interview-preparation#:~:text=). Interviewers look for clear, efficient solutions and expect you to explain your thought process as you code.
    
- **When they occur.** In most hiring processes, coding interviews happen in early rounds. At Amazon, the live coding session is part of the technical phone screen, where an engineer assesses problem‑solving approach and code quality[systemdesignhandbook.com](https://www.systemdesignhandbook.com/guides/amazon-system-design-interview/#:~:text=1,while%20clearly%20explaining%20your%20approach).
    
- **Changing expectations.** While the format is the same, the bar has risen. Interviewers increasingly ask multi‑step or harder LeetCode‑style problems. Remote interviewing has also standardised the use of shared editors rather than physical whiteboards, and companies may give candidates a take‑home or online assessment before live coding rounds[systemdesignhandbook.com](https://www.systemdesignhandbook.com/guides/amazon-system-design-interview/#:~:text=1,while%20clearly%20explaining%20your%20approach).
    

### How system‑design interviews are structured

- **When they appear.** System‑design interviews are typically reserved for mid‑ to senior‑level roles. Google notes that “for entry‑level positions such as L3, you’ll only face DSA rounds, but for senior positions like L5 there is a mandatory system design round”[preplaced.in](https://www.preplaced.in/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-google-technical-interview-preparation#:~:text=For%20entry,you%E2%80%99ll%20only%20face%20DSA%20rounds).
    
- **Interview loop placement.** At Amazon, system‑design questions are part of the on‑site (or virtual) loop that follows initial coding screens. Candidates go through several rounds – coding, design and behavioural – before meeting a “bar raiser”[systemdesignhandbook.com](https://www.systemdesignhandbook.com/guides/amazon-system-design-interview/#:~:text=4.%20Virtual%20or%20on,alignment%20with%20Amazon%E2%80%99s%20Leadership%20Principles).
    
- **Format and evaluation.** System‑design interviews are usually 45‑ to 60‑minute discussions in which you’re asked to design a large‑scale, real‑world system (e.g., a recommendation engine or inventory system). Unlike coding interviews, which focus on algorithms, system‑design interviews evaluate your ability to think holistically about scalability, reliability, trade‑offs and technology choices. Amazon emphasises that these interviews assess how candidates architect robust, scalable systems and communicate trade‑offs[systemdesignhandbook.com](https://www.systemdesignhandbook.com/guides/amazon-system-design-interview/#:~:text=In%20Amazon%E2%80%99s%20System%20Design%20interview%2C,service%2C%20among%20other%20complex%20architectures). The interviewer expects you to clarify requirements, outline the architecture, discuss data flow and justify design decisions[systemdesignhandbook.com](https://www.systemdesignhandbook.com/guides/amazon-system-design-interview/#:~:text=Amazon%E2%80%99s%20System%20Design%20interviews%20typically,breakdown%20of%20the%20key%20stages).
    

### Notable shifts in 2024–2025

- **More demanding questions.** Hiring managers report that both coding and design interviews have become more rigorous; candidates are expected to handle harder problems quickly and discuss deeper trade‑offs.
    
- **Down‑levelling and multiple loops.** Because companies have tightened budgets, they sometimes hire senior engineers at a lower level (“down‑levelling”). This makes behavioural and leadership‑principles interviews more prominent.
    
- **Hybrid/remote formats.** Interviews now frequently occur over video calls using collaborative coding tools, and on‑site loops may be condensed into shorter virtual sessions. Team‑matching and culture‑fit rounds have become more important, with companies emphasising communication and alignment with their values[preplaced.in](https://www.preplaced.in/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-google-technical-interview-preparation#:~:text=platform%2C%20or%20through%20shared%20code,editors).
    

In summary, **DSA/coding interviews still revolve around solving timed algorithmic problems**, while **system‑design interviews test your ability to architect scalable systems and communicate trade‑offs**. Recent changes involve higher difficulty levels, expanded behavioural assessment and more remote or hybrid interview loops, but the fundamental formats of these two core interview types remain the same
