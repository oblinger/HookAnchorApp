### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)

#### dlproj1: 
Jasper Chat – a ChatGPT-like mode within Jasper’s AI content platform that lets users generate text through a natural conversation interface. Launched in late 2022, Jasper Chat removed the need for manual prompt-crafting: users can ask in plain English and get helpful content generated ￼. It’s built on GPT-3.5/4 and tailored for business use cases, allowing marketers and writers to brainstorm, refine, and iterate content with an AI assistant in real time ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Brand Voice & Knowledge – Jasper introduced a Brand Voice feature that lets companies fine-tune the AI on their own style guide and facts. Marketers can input example content and key info, and Jasper “learns” the company’s tone, terminology, and facts ￼. The AI then generates text that stays on-brand and factual. Jasper’s Brand IQ system will even flag outputs that don’t match the predefined brand guidelines, and allow teams to edit or correct them before use ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Jasper Art (Image Generation) – an AI image generation tool integrated into Jasper for creating custom visuals. Powered initially by DALL·E 2 and Stable Diffusion, Jasper Art allows users to turn text descriptions into images for blog posts, ads, or social media. In 2023 Jasper acquired Clipdrop (an AI image editing platform) to enhance these capabilities ￼. Now users can not only generate images within Jasper, but also instantly remove backgrounds, upscale, or modify images – streamlining visual content creation alongside text.
