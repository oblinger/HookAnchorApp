### Toxicity
#### toxicity: 6
#### tox_summary: Declining supportiveness
#### tox_justification: 
Meta (formerly Facebook) has seen its workplace supportiveness decline in recent years. It was once highly regarded, and still about 81% of Meta employee reviews are positive on Comparably [oai_citation_attribution:32‡comparably.com](https://www.comparably.com/companies/meta/reviews#:~:text=Meta%20Employee%20Reviews%20,The), indicating many workers find it a good environment. However, multiple waves of layoffs in 2022–2023 and internal turmoil have eroded morale. Moreover, a recent lawsuit by a 15-year veteran employee alleges Meta tolerated years of harassment and retaliation, describing a 'toxic culture that silences women' [oai_citation_attribution:33‡vcpost.com](https://www.vcpost.com/articles/128878/20250211/meta-accused-silencing-women-enabling-toxic-work-culture-new-lawsuit.htm#:~:text=Meta%2C%20the%20tech%20giant%20behind,toxic%20culture%20that%20silences%20women) [oai_citation_attribution:34‡vcpost.com](https://www.vcpost.com/articles/128878/20250211/meta-accused-silencing-women-enabling-toxic-work-culture-new-lawsuit.htm#:~:text=The%20lawsuit%20also%20alleges%20a,unchecked%20harassment%20within%20the%20company). These reports suggest Meta’s work culture now has significant problems despite some remaining positives.
