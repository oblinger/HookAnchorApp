### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: B+
#### dlproj1: 
LangChain Framework – an open-source toolkit that lets developers chain together LLMs with external data sources and tools to build context-aware generative AI applications ￼. It provides abstractions for prompts, memory, and integration with APIs, simplifying the development of complex AI workflows.
#### dlproj2: 
LangChain Hub – a community hub for sharing and discovering prompts, chains, and agents. Launched in 2023, it allows developers to upload and reuse effective prompt workflows and chain configurations, accelerating development of LLM applications ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
LangSmith – a unified platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring LLM apps built with LangChain. LangSmith (introduced 2023) provides tools to trace chain executions, evaluate output quality, and catch errors, helping move LLM applications from prototype to production reliably ￼.
