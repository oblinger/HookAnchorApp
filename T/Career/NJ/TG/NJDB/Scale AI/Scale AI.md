Scale Spellbook – a platform by Scale AI for rapidly building and deploying LLM-based applications. Spellbook provides a “prompt engineering” studio where users can experiment with different prompts and models side by side and then deploy the best-performing version as an API endpoint ￼. It streamlines the full LLM app lifecycle (prompt iteration, model selection, and serving) into a unified tool ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
RLHF Data & Tuning – Scale is known for supplying high-quality training data and human feedback for top AI labs. Its Generative AI Data Engine has powered reinforcement learning from human feedback for some of the most advanced LLMs ￼. For example, Scale’s contractors label preferences or rank model outputs (at massive scale) to fine-tune models like OpenAI’s, helping align them with human intentions. Scale also offers supervised fine-tuning services for custom models.
#### dlproj3: 
Model Evaluation – Scale AI offers a robust evaluation framework for generative models. This includes hosting public leaderboards and conducting adversarial testing (red-teaming) of models. Enterprises can use Scale’s evaluation platform to benchmark different LLMs or monitor an application’s accuracy and safety over time ￼. For instance, Scale can test a chatbot on domain-specific queries and edge cases, report failure modes, and then help collect additional data or safety checks to improve it.
