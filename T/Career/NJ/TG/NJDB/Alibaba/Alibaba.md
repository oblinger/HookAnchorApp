### Toxicity
#### toxicity: 2
#### tox_summary: Toxic work culture
#### tox_justification: 
Alibaba’s work environment has been marked by toxicity and a lack of support. Founder Jack Ma publicly endorsed the demanding '996' work schedule (9am to 9pm, six days a week) as a 'huge blessing' for young workers [oai_citation_attribution:4‡the-independent.com](https://www.the-independent.com/asia/china/china-baidu-pr-toxic-work-culture-b2542082.html#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20Alibaba%20co,and%20called%20it%20a%20%E2%80%9Cblessing%E2%80%9D), reflecting a culture of excessive overwork. In 2021, a female employee’s sexual assault allegations exposed serious problems: management failed to act on her reports until she went public, prompting widespread criticism of Alibaba’s corporate culture [oai_citation_attribution:5‡theregister.com](https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/09/alibaba_fires_manager_alleged_sexual_assault/#:~:text=On%20Monday%2C%20Alibaba%20chief%20executive,incident%20and%20Alibaba%27s%20corporate%20culture) [oai_citation_attribution:6‡theregister.com](https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/09/alibaba_fires_manager_alleged_sexual_assault/#:~:text=Chinese%20State%20media%20has%20strongly,create%20a%20decent%20corporate%20culture). These incidents suggest a highly toxic and unsupportive workplace.
