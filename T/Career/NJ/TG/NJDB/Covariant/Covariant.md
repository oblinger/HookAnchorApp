To build the Covariant Brain, a universal AI giving robots the ability to see, reason, and act on the world around them ￼.
### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: B+
#### dlproj1: 
Covariant Brain (Universal AI) – The Covariant Brain is a universal AI robotics platform that enables robots to learn new tasks and handle novel objects through deep reinforcement learning. It was tested in the ABB order-picking challenge, where a Covariant robot system, without task-specific programming, won by successfully picking a wide variety of unseen items ￼. The Brain’s neural network policies are trained on millions of grasp attempts, giving Covariant-powered robots the ability to generalize – e.g., a warehouse robot can pick up arbitrary products it’s never encountered before, achieving automation in e-commerce fulfillment that was previously impractical.

RFM-1 (Robotics Foundation Model) – Covariant’s Robotics Foundation Model 1 is a large-scale multimodal AI model designed for robotics ￼. It’s trained not only on internet-scale data (text and images, for broad semantic understanding) but also on an enormous dataset of real-world robotic interactions collected by Covariant over years ￼. RFM-1 gives robots a form of common sense about the physical world – for instance, understanding concepts of support, gravity, and object properties – which improves their reasoning and decision-making in new scenarios. Covariant reports that RFM-1 is the first foundation model deployed in hundreds of physical robots, where it powers capabilities like dynamic grasping and tool use in factories.

AI-Driven Robotic Picking Deployments – Covariant has partnered with logistics automation companies (e.g. KNAPP) to deploy AI-powered picking robots in live production. One example is at McKesson, a major pharmaceutical distributor, which installed Covariant’s AI on KNAPP “Pick-it-Easy” robotic stations to handle pharmacy items. The Covariant-enabled robots can reliably pick and sort thousands of different products (from pill bottles to odd-shaped packages) with high precision, 24/7 ￼. These deployments, numbering in the hundreds of robots across retailers and 3PLs, demonstrate Covariant’s applied AI achieving less than <0.1% error rates and significant throughput gains in real warehouses ￼, validating the real-world performance of their deep learning robotics.
