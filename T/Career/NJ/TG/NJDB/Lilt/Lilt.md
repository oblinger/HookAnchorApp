### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Contextual AI Engine (V3) – Lilt’s latest generation of generative translation models (Contextual AI V3) with 5× larger capacity and 20%+ higher quality. These models learn and adapt in real time from human translator feedback, allowing Lilt’s platform to quickly incorporate client-specific terminology and style at the document/project level for more accurate machine translations ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Lilt Create – a generative AI multilingual content generation tool introduced by Lilt. It enables users to produce brand-aligned content in multiple languages directly, by leveraging Lilt’s underlying translation LLMs. Lilt Create helps regional teams draft and localize content (marketing copy, support articles, etc.) in any target language rapidly, accelerating global content creation ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Model Builder – Lilt’s LLM hub that allows fine-tuning and deployment of custom and third-party models. It supports training domain-specific translation models and even integrating external models like Microsoft Translator or OpenAI GPT-3.5 within Lilt’s platform, all with enterprise controls. This capability lets customers bring their own models and continually improve translation quality with their proprietary data ￼ ￼.
