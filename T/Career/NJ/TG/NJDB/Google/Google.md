### Toxicity
#### toxicity: 8
#### tox_summary: Mostly supportive, recently strained
#### tox_justification: 
Google has long been known for a supportive, employee-friendly workplace. It still holds a high 4.4/5 average employee rating on Glassdoor, with about 85% of Googlers willing to recommend the company [oai_citation_attribution:20‡glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Google-large-company-Reviews-EI_IE9079.0,6_KH7,20.htm#:~:text=Google%20has%20an%20overall%20rating,recommend%20working%20at%20Google), reflecting strong overall satisfaction. However, in early 2023 Google experienced its first mass layoffs (around 12,000 employees), which hurt morale – an internal survey indicated morale was at 'an all time low' afterwards [oai_citation_attribution:21‡businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/layoffs-pivots-race-for-ai-supremacy-inside-google-tumultuous-2023-2023-12#:~:text=,employees%20appeared%20to%20be%20feeling). Despite these setbacks, Google’s culture remains broadly positive and far from highly toxic.
