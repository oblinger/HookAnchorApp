### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)

Enterprise LLMs & SLMs – Aisera has developed enterprise-grade LLMs (including 25+ domain-specific large models for IT, HR, banking, etc.) and smaller task-specific language models. These models are pre-trained on relevant context and terminology, yielding more accurate, contextually relevant responses in enterprise assistant scenarios while operating at a fraction of the cost of generic LLMs ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
LLM Gateway – Aisera’s platform includes an AI Gateway that provides a unified interface to various foundation models (OpenAI, Azure, Meta LLaMA2, etc.), handling load balancing, response optimization, and security. This middleware allows organizations to “bring your own LLM” and dynamically deploy or switch models for their virtual assistants without dealing with each model’s API idiosyncrasies
#### dlproj3: 
AiseraGPT Copilot – a turnkey Generative AI solution (“where chatbots meet action bots”) that uses Aisera’s enterprise LLMs to not only converse with users in natural language but also execute actions via workflow automation. For example, AiseraGPT can understand a user’s request in context and trigger the appropriate IT or HR workflow (password reset, ticket creation, etc.), delivering end-to-end resolution in a conversational manner ￼ ￼.
