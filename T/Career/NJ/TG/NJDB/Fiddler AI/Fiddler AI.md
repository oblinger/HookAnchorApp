### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
LLM Observability Platform – Fiddler’s enterprise AI observability solution now supports large language models, allowing organizations to monitor LLM-driven applications for data drift, quality issues, and bias, and to explain and audit LLM outputs across use cases ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Fiddler Trust Models & Enrichments – a proprietary framework of task-specific models fine-tuned by Fiddler to evaluate LLM outputs in real time (scoring for hallucinations, toxicity, PII leakage, etc.), enabling “guardrails” that detect unsafe or incorrect responses within milliseconds ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Guardrails & Safety – Fiddler’s platform provides an LLM Gateway and Trust Service that let enterprises dynamically route prompts through approved models and inject safety checks; e.g. it can intercept prompt-injection attacks or policy violations using fast trust scores before an LLM response reaches the end-user ￼ ￼.
