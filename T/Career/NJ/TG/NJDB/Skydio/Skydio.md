### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: B
#### dlproj1: 
Deep neural drone pilot – Created a learned drone control policy using imitation learning (with the Skydio Autonomy Engine as the expert). This CEILing approach trains a neural network pilot that can autonomously fly and film while avoiding obstacles, imitating the expert’s intent rather than exact path￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Autonomy engine (360° vision) – Skydio’s drone uses six 4K navigation cameras to build a real-time 3D model of its surroundings (over 1M pts/sec) and runs up to nine deep neural networks to predict motion and avoid obstacles ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
3D Scan adaptive mapping – Developed Skydio 3D Scan, an AI-driven scanning software that autonomously pilots the drone to generate high-resolution 3D models of structures with full coverage, revolutionizing inspection and mapping ￼.
