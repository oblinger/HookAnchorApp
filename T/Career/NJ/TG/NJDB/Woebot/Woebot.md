Woebot for Depression (Wysa Trial) – Woebot is a therapy chatbot that delivers Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) through daily conversations. In a controlled study, young adults who chatted with Woebot saw a significantly greater reduction in PHQ-9 depression scores over two weeks compared to those who only read self-help materials ￼ ￼. This landmark 2017 trial demonstrated that a fully-automated chatbot can feasibly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, validating Woebot’s approach as an effective digital mental health intervention.

WB001 Postpartum Depression Therapeutic – An AI-driven digital therapeutic developed by Woebot Health for new mothers with postpartum depression. Dubbed WB001, it’s an 8-week program delivered via the Woebot app, combining clinically-proven CBT techniques with Woebot’s empathetic conversational agent. In 2021, WB001 received FDA Breakthrough Device designation – a first for a chatbot – recognizing its potential to address PPD, a condition affecting ~1 in 8 women ￼ ￼. WB001 is currently in a pivotal trial ￼ to evaluate its efficacy under physician supervision as a prescribed digital treatment.

Therapeutic Alliance via AI – Woebot’s design emphasizes relationship-building, and research indicates users do develop a bond with the bot. In fact, a JMIR study found Woebot was capable of establishing a level of therapeutic alliance (rapport and trust) with users that’s comparable to human-led therapy ￼. This is achieved through the bot’s natural, friendly dialogue and emotional reflections. It’s a key insight for generative AI in healthcare: despite knowing it’s an AI, people can feel heard and supported by Woebot, which is crucial for mental health outcomes.
