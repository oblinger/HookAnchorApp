### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)

OSARO AutoModel – An AI-powered software module that enables warehouse robots to rapidly learn new products and adapt to changing workflows on their own ￼. AutoModel, introduced in 2024 as part of OSARO’s SightWorks perception platform, uses deep learning to eliminate the usual retraining downtime when a new SKU is introduced. Instead of engineers collecting images and re-programming, an OSARO-equipped picking robot can encounter a new item and AutoModel will automatically train itself on that item’s appearance and handling, all during live operation ￼. This breakthrough allows e-commerce fulfillment centers to handle seasonal or fast-changing inventory with zero robot downtime.

OSARO + Geek+ Integrated Picking – OSARO partnered with AMR provider Geek+ to create a fully automated warehouse picking solution. In this setup, Geek+ Autonomous Mobile Robots deliver shelves or bins to a station, and an OSARO-powered FANUC robotic arm then picks items from those bins ￼. OSARO’s advanced vision (SightWorks) identifies the target items and directs the robot to grasp and place them as needed ￼. The integration is facilitated by OSARO’s open REST API, which allowed seamless communication between the mobile robots, robot arm, and warehouse management system. This collaboration demonstrates an end-to-end generative AI-driven robotics system: mobile robots navigating to bring goods and a stationary robot with AI vision doing the picking, together increasing throughput and reducing labor in warehouses.

Mixed-Case Depalletizing – OSARO’s AI is also applied in inbound logistics through its Robotic Mixed-Case Depalletizer ￼. This system uses OSARO’s machine learning vision to unload pallets that contain layers of assorted products (boxes of different sizes, shapes, packaging) – a traditionally difficult task for automation. The AI vision can recognize each box, including oddly shaped or shrink-wrapped ones, and plan safe removal. The robot, equipped with a smart gripper, then autonomously lifts each box off the stack. OSARO’s depalletizer improves warehouse safety and efficiency by handling heavy repetitive unloading work and can adapt to unpredictable pallet configurations (like missing or damaged boxes) on the fly ￼. Several 3PLs and retailers have deployed this solution to address labor shortages and injury reduction in distribution centers.
