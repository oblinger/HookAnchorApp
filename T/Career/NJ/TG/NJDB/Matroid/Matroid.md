### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
No-code vision detectors – Built an enterprise no-code computer vision platform that lets users train custom detectors without coding. Under the hood, Matroid uses proprietary deep learning networks that learn and improve over time, enabling detection of any object, defect, action or event in video streams ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Visual anomaly detection – Applied deep learning for industrial inspection: Matroid’s system can precisely detect and classify manufacturing defects or safety hazards in real time, outperforming rigid rule-based vision solutions ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Activity and event recognition – Matroid’s platform extends to complex video analytics, allowing users to detect human behaviors, incidents, and events (e.g. security breaches, operational irregularities) across diverse industries via trained AI models ￼.
