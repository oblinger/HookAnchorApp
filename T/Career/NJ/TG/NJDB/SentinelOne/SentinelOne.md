Generative AI Threat Hunting – a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity AI platform that embeds a large language model interface into threat hunting, letting analysts ask complex questions in natural language and get detailed, correlated threat answers in seconds ￼
#### dlproj2: 
Embedded Neural Nets – the SentinelOne agent uses on-device deep learning models (neural networks) to autonomously detect malicious behaviors and stop attacks on endpoints in real time without human intervention ￼
#### dlproj3: 
Deep Learning Endpoint Protection – as an early mover in AI security, SentinelOne pioneered using deep neural networks (instead of signatures) for malware detection, enabling its autonomous endpoint protection platform to identify threats with high speed and accuracy ￼
