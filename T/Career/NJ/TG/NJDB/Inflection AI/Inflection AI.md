Pi (Personal AI) – an AI chatbot that serves as a friendly personal assistant. Inflection launched Pi in 2023 as a ChatGPT alternative, powered by its in-house large language model. The first version used the Inflection-1 model (trained on ~4% of the compute of GPT-4), and a later Inflection-2.5 model (trained with 10× more compute) nearly matched GPT-4 on many tasks ￼ ￼.

Inflection-1 LLM – Inflection’s proprietary large language model series. The 1st-gen model (Inflection-1) was trained on 1.5 trillion tokens and the latest Inflection-3.0 was deployed for enterprise. Inflection open-sourced 3B & 7B versions for research ￼. These models power Pi and can generate text or code, enabling a range of applications.
Massive AI Cluster – Inflection (with CoreWeave and NVIDIA) is building the world’s largest AI training cluster (22,000 H100 GPUs) to power its advanced large language models, supporting Pi and other products
#### dlproj3: 
Intel Collaboration – Inflection AI partnered with Intel to deliver its models to enterprises. They announced an Inflection 3.0-based appliance using Intel’s Gaudi3 AI accelerators ￼. This Inflection for Enterprise system runs Inflection’s latest model on-premises with high efficiency, offering tailored chatbot and instruction-following AI services for business use ￼.
Inflection for Enterprise – an enterprise-grade AI system (Inflection 3.0 model) launched with Intel’s support, allowing companies to own and fine-tune a dedicated LLM appliance on Intel Gaudi hardware for secure, high-performance generative AI [oai_citation_attribution:3‡businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241007441972/en/Introducing-Inflection-for-Enterprise#:~:text=PALO%20ALTO%2C%20Calif.,for%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20largest%20enterprises)
