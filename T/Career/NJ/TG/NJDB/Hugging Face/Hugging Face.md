### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
🤗 Transformers Library – popular open-source library unifying state-of-the-art Transformer models (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.) under a common API for NLP and beyond ￼
#### dlproj2: 
🤗 Datasets Library – community-driven library for accessing and sharing standard machine learning datasets with uniform interfaces and versioning ￼
#### dlproj3: 
🤗 Diffusers Library – toolbox for pre-trained diffusion models (e. g. Stable Diffusion) that enables image, audio, and 3D content generation with just a few lines of code ￼
#### dlproj4: 
BigScience BLOOM – 176B-parameter multilingual language model released open-access as part of the global Big Science research collaboration on large LMs ￼
#### dlproj5: 
BigCode (StarCoder) – open scientific project (with ServiceNow) producing state-of-the-art code generation models (StarCoder, 15B params) under responsible data governance for AI-assisted development ￼
#### dlproj6: 
Hugging Face Hub – online platform and repository hosting thousands of pretrained models, datasets, and demos, catalyzing open-source and academic collaboration in AI research ￼

### justification: 
Hugging Face has built the largest open-source AI community, providing tools like the Transformers library and hosting thousands of models. Notably, it co-led development of BLOOM, an open LLM that can generate content in 46 languages [oai_citation_attribution:36‡eweek.com](https://www.eweek.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai-startups/#:~:text=classification%2C%20and%20object%20detection,languages%20and%2013%20programming%20languages)
