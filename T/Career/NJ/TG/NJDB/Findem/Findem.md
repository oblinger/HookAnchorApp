### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)

Attribute-Based Talent Cloud – Findem’s platform creates a rich “attribute” profile for each person by mining myriad data sources. For example, it might generate attributes like “experience scaling a team from 10→50” or “expert in AWS security” from a candidate’s history ￼. These AI-generated attributes go far beyond standard resume fields, enabling extremely targeted talent searches. This applied AI (which uses deep learning NLP to parse text and infer qualities) means recruiters can search on real-world criteria – e.g. “software engineers who have worked at fintech startups and led cloud migration” – and Findem will find matching candidates even if those exact words aren’t on their resume ￼.

Conversational Talent Assistant – Findem integrated Generative AI (ChatGPT) into its Talent Data Cloud, allowing recruiters to ask questions in natural language and get instant answers from Findem’s data ￼. A recruiter can literally type a query like, “Show me senior engineers in London with fintech experience who could fit a DevOps role”, and the AI assistant will interpret it and return a list of candidates meeting those criteria ￼. It also helps with tasks like writing outreach messages and generating market intelligence reports (“What companies are hiring ML engineers in Seattle?”) – all through an intuitive chat interface grounded in Findem’s proprietary talent dataset.

Findem–HireBrain Workflow – Findem partnered with HireBrain (a hiring platform using neuroscience and generative AI) to streamline the hiring process end-to-end ￼. In this collaborative solution, a HireBrain AI Intake Assistant first captures requirements from hiring managers via a conversation and automatically generates a well-defined job description. That job description feeds into Findem’s AI sourcing engine (the Findem Copilot), which immediately searches for candidates matching the specified attributes ￼. This integration of generative AI in job scoping with deep AI search in sourcing allows companies to go from initial role definition to a slate of quality candidates in a fraction of the time, with the AI handling the heavy lifting of both understanding needs and finding talent.
