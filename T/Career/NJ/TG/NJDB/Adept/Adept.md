ACT-1 (Action Transformer) – Adept’s first large model that can take actions on a computer. ACT-1 is a transformer trained to use digital tools via a browser – it observes a rendered webpage and can click, type, and scroll to execute tasks ￼. This is a step toward a general AI assistant that can do anything a human can do on a PC ￼. [oai_citation_attribution:5‡adept.ai](https://www.adept.ai/blog/act-1#:~:text=Capability%20preview)
#### dlproj2: 
AI Assistant Overlay – Adept built a prototype interface for ACT-1 as a Chrome extension overlaying existing software. A user can simply type a command (in natural language), and ACT-1 will carry out the multi-step process autonomously ￼ ￼. For example, ACT-1 can take a high-level instruction like “Import LinkedIn contacts into Salesforce” and perform all the clicks and data entry across both apps to complete it ￼.
Natural Language Tool Interface – Adept’s models let users control existing software with language; Adept has worked with enterprises to build AI that uses apps like Adobe Photoshop or Airtable via natural language, automating workflows and boosting productivity [oai_citation_attribution:6‡reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/adept-raises-350-mln-series-b-funding-2023-03-14/#:~:text=Founded%20by%20former%20Google%20researchers%2C,opens%20new%20tab%20and%20Airtable)
#### dlproj3: 
Multi-App Tool Use – ACT-1 demonstrated the ability to coordinate actions across multiple applications and websites. It can compose different tools to achieve a goal (e.g. researching info online, then updating a spreadsheet) all in one workflow ￼. Adept’s research vision is a generalist AI agent that learns to use “every software tool, API, and webapp that exists,” extending automation to virtually any digital task ￼.
Amazon-Adept Collaboration – in 2024 Amazon hired Adept’s CEO and researchers and licensed the startup’s technology, a strategic deal to incorporate Adept’s action-taking AI into Amazon’s own AI efforts (now under FTC review) [oai_citation_attribution:7‡reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftc-seeking-details-amazon-deal-with-ai-startup-adept-source-says-2024-07-16/#:~:text=The%20informal%20inquiry%20into%20Amazon%2C,some%20of%20the%20startup%27s%20technology)
