### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Domino AI Gateway – a new capability that serves as a unified gateway for large language model APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), giving enterprise teams a secure, governed way to invoke LLMs (holding API keys, controlling access per user, and tracking token usage) while allowing easy switching of model backends without code changes ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Vector DB Integration – Domino’s platform added native connectors for vector databases (e.g. Pinecone, Qdrant) to support Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflows; this lets users seamlessly store embeddings of enterprise data and feed relevant contexts to LLMs for more reliable answers in apps like enterprise Q&A chatbots ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
AI Project Hub Templates – Domino’s AI Hub provides pre-built generative AI reference projects and templates (chatbots, summarization tools, LLM fine-tuning examples like LLaMA-2 and Falcon, etc.) using its Contextual AI platform, so enterprises can jumpstart GenAI use cases with best practices and minimal setup ￼ ￼.
