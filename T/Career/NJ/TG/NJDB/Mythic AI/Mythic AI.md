Mythic’s vision is to make it much easier and more affordable to deploy powerful artificial intelligence everywhere ￼.
### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Built an analog compute-in-memory AI chip (Mythic AMP) that stores neural network weights in flash memory cells, enabling up to 25 trillion operations per second on-chip with minimal power. This innovative analog architecture eliminates external memory bottlenecks for AI inference ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Demonstrated the chip on popular deep learning models – e.g. running object detection and vision DNNs like YOLOv3/YOLOv5, ResNet-50, or OpenPose on-device – showing high-performance computer vision inference with far lower power use than digital processors ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Exploring analog hardware for large models: Mythic’s in-memory analog computing removes memory bandwidth limits, a natural fit for bandwidth-hungry tasks like large language models. The company envisions bringing LLM-scale AI to the edge by leveraging analog matrix ops to handle massive model parameters efficiently ￼.
