### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Watson (DeepQA) – question-answering AI that made history by defeating champions on Jeopardy! (2011), using IBM’s DeepQA architecture to parse natural-language clues, generate hypotheses, gather evidence from huge text corpora, and rank answers with high confidence ￼ ￼
#### dlproj2: 
Project Debater – first AI system to meaningfully debate humans on complex topics, scanning billions of sentences to generate persuasive speeches, listen to a human opponent, and formulate rebuttals using a rich knowledge graph of world facts ￼
#### dlproj3: 
RXN for Chemistry – cloud AI platform treating chemistry like a language: uses sequence-to-sequence Transformer models to predict chemical reaction outcomes and assist in retrosynthesis planning by “translating” between molecular representations (SMILES) ￼
#### dlproj4: 
Maximo Visual Inspection – IBM’s deep learning computer vision platform that generates and deploys custom vision models (e.g. defect detection in manufacturing), combining generative data augmentation and explainability for industrial inspection【n/a】
#### dlproj5: 
IBM FedML (FL) – IBM’s research in federated learning enables training generative models on decentralized data (e.g. edge devices) with privacy, demonstrated on tasks like emoji prediction and medical imaging (applied DL at the edge)【n/a】

### Toxicity
#### toxicity: 6
#### tox_summary: Mixed support and challenges
#### tox_justification: 
IBM’s workplace environment has both supportive and problematic aspects. Employee surveys in 2021–22 ranked IBM’s culture among the top in the world (it was rated the #2 large company for global culture) [oai_citation_attribution:24‡businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/employers-comparably-list-of-best-global-company-culture-2022-3#:~:text=For%20this%20ranking%2C%20employee%20ratings,March%202021%20through%20March%202022), and about 72% of IBM employees say it’s a great place to work [oai_citation_attribution:25‡greatplacetowork.com](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/certified-company/1121389#:~:text=72,based%20company). This indicates many find it supportive. On the other hand, IBM has been dealing with a series of age discrimination lawsuits and frequent layoffs in recent years, which have damaged morale and led some to describe the environment as 'very negative and toxic' [oai_citation_attribution:26‡hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/ibm-hr-professionals-suit-age-discrimination-layoffs/694555/#:~:text=HR%20pros%20say%20IBM%20fired,to%20replace%20them%20with%20AI) [oai_citation_attribution:27‡glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/IBM-work-environment-Reviews-EI_IE354.0,3_KH4,20.htm#:~:text=Glassdoor%20www,the%20many%20rounds%20of%20redundancies). These mixed factors put IBM in the middle of the pack for workplace supportiveness.
