#### dlproj1: 
Automated text summarization – Primer’s AI analyzes large collections of documents (news, reports, multi-language text) and automatically summarizes the most important information. This system helps analysts by generating readable summaries and “headlines” from a data haystack, vastly speeding up intelligence and business research ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Report generation platform – Primer’s solutions (e.g. Primer Delta) let users swiftly generate fully-sourced analytic reports. The platform uses advanced NLP and transformer-based models to collate facts and produce human-readable analyses from raw data, augmenting human analysts in producing briefs ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Intelligence AI (Command & Delta) – Primer developed NLP platforms built on large transformers for defense and enterprise intel. Primer Command (for open-source intel) and Primer Delta (for secure internal data) enable real-time monitoring of thousands of sources and allow analysts to query and receive generated insights, all on-premises for security ￼ ￼.
