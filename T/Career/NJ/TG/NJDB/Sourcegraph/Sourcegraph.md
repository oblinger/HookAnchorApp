Raised $50M in 2023 at a sharply lower valuation (~80% drop from its 2021 unicorn valuation) – reflecting a broader “valuation reset” in late-stage startups ￼

Cody AI Assistant – an AI coding assistant introduced by Sourcegraph that uses large language models to help with code. Cody can answer questions about a codebase, suggest code completions, and generate or fix code. It works by combining LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, or open models) with Sourcegraph’s universal code search, so it has relevant context from the repository when responding ￼ ￼. Cody lives in the IDE (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.) and has an enterprise version for private code.
#### dlproj2: 
Cody Open Source – In late 2023, Sourcegraph open-sourced Cody (v1.0) under an Apache license. The open source Cody uses models like BigCode’s StarCoder for code generation, and incorporates a dense vector retrieval system to fetch relevant code snippets and docs as context for prompts ￼ ￼. Developers can self-host this version and even plug in other LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 2, etc.), enabling them to experiment with AI coding assistance locally.
#### dlproj3: 
Semantic Code Graph – Sourcegraph’s backend builds a “code graph” by indexing repositories and understanding definitions and references (who calls what, etc.). Cody leverages this semantic graph: for example, it can retrieve all usages of a function or the documentation of an API to ground its answers. This approach provides deeper context than plain text search, improving the relevance of Cody’s suggestions and plans (e.g. it can outline an implementation by finding related code patterns) ￼. Sourcegraph plans to integrate this more tightly so Cody’s autocompletions and refactoring advice become even more aware of project-wide code structure.
