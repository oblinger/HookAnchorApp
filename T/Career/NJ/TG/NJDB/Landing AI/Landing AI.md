LandingLens Platform – a visual inspection software for manufacturing that enables training of custom computer vision models with limited data. LandingLens employs techniques like synthetic data generation (e.g. adding simulated scratches or defects to images) and transfer learning to overcome the “small data” problem in industrial AI ￼ ￼. This allows factories to build defect detectors or OCR models even when only a few defective samples are available.

VisionAgent – a generative visual AI tool (introduced by Andrew Ng’s team in 2024) that performs “agentic” object detection using prompts. Instead of requiring thousands of labeled images, VisionAgent can detect objects or anomalies based on a text description of what to find ￼ ￼. It uses advanced reasoning to handle complex scenes and boasts accuracy exceeding some traditional trained models – all with zero manual labeling, which dramatically speeds up developing vision AI solutions.
#### dlproj3: 
Few-Shot Learning – Landing AI has pioneered few-shot learning approaches for vision tasks. In one approach, an AI is trained on thousands of tiny vision tasks (each with only, say, 10 images) so that it learns to generalize from minimal examples ￼. When that model is applied to a new inspection task with only a handful of real examples, it can recognize defects or patterns surprisingly well because it has essentially seen many analogous small-data tasks before. This data-centric technique helps manufacturers deploy AI with very little proprietary data.
