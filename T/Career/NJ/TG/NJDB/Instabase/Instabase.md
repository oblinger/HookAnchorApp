Instabase AI Hub – a platform launched in 2023 for generative document understanding. AI Hub is a repository of AI apps focused on content like tax forms, invoices, and IDs, enabling users to apply AI to parse and analyze unstructured data. One app (“Converse”) provides a chat interface where users ask questions and get answers sourced from their documents (using GPT-4 and other LLMs with retrieval) ￼ ￼.

OpenAI Partnership – Instabase has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate cutting-edge LLMs (like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) into its platform. In a Bloomberg TV interview, Instabase’s CEO discussed how using OpenAI’s models enhanced Instabase’s ability to let enterprise users automatically extract insights from documents via natural language queries ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
AI Hub Build – a no-code generative workflow builder within Instabase AI Hub. It allows users to create end-to-end document processing pipelines (e.g. an app that reads mortgage applications and summarizes key fields) by chaining LLM-powered steps. Businesses can customize pre-built blocks and deploy these workflows to automate document-heavy processes without writing code ￼ ￼.
