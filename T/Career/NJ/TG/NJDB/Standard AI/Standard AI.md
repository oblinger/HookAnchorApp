### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Developed an autonomous checkout platform using ceiling-mounted cameras and deep learning to let customers shop and leave without stopping to pay. Their system matches products to shoppers (even if items are pocketed or returned to the shelf) with no scanning or checkout lines, as shown in Standard Market (a cashierless store demo) ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Expanded the technology into computer vision retail analytics. The Standard Vision system uses AI cameras to capture shopper behavior and product interactions in-store, providing retailers with insights like foot traffic patterns, shelf engagement, conversion rates, and other operational metrics in real-time ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Built an AI-powered loss prevention tool that analyzes video for shoplifting – the system’s algorithms flag likely theft events and compile video clips of those incidents for review. This automated monitoring lets staff focus only on credible theft alerts, improving security efficiency ￼.
