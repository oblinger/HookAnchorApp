### funding_justification: Raised ~$10M extension in May 2022 (~33 months ago); base=10/34≈0.29
### proj1: OpenSynthetics (open community for synthetic data)
### justification: 
Synthesis AI creates photorealistic simulated images and videos for training AI. Its generative models produce diverse human faces and scenes to fuel computer vision systems (for AR/VR, automotive, security, etc.), and the company advocates for ethical AI development using synthetic data [oai_citation_attribution:95‡eweek.com](https://www.eweek.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai-startups/#:~:text=Synthesis%20AI) [oai_citation_attribution:96‡eweek.com](https://www.eweek.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai-startups/#:~:text=,and%20Solutions%3A%20Data%20Visualizer%2C%20OpenSynthetics)
