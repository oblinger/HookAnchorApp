### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)

#### dlproj1: 
Stable Diffusion – the widely influential open-source text-to-image model developed with Stability AI’s support. First released in 2022, Stable Diffusion can generate high-quality, photorealistic images from text prompts ￼. It was a breakthrough in enabling anyone (researchers and hobbyists alike) to create art and visuals with AI, and has since spawned many refined versions (e.g. SD 1.5, SDXL) and use cases from design to entertainment.
Stable Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photorealistic images from any text input [oai_citation_attribution:29‡huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4#:~:text=CompVis%2Fstable,images%20given%20any%20text%20input)
#### dlproj2: 
StableLM – Stability AI’s open large language model suite. In 2023 the company open-sourced the StableLM-Alpha models (3B and 7B parameters, with larger 15–65B in progress) trained on 1.5 trillion tokens ￼. These models (and their fine-tuned chat versions) can generate text and code and are released under a permissive license for commercial and research use. StableLM is intended to “make foundational AI technology accessible to all,” analogous to how Stable Diffusion opened image generation ￼.

#### dlproj3: 
Stable Audio – an AI system for music and sound generation. Launched in Sep 2023, Stable Audio is Stability AI’s first product for generating original audio via latent diffusion models ￼. Given a text prompt (and a desired length), Stable Audio produces a high-quality 44.1 kHz stereo track up to 90 seconds ￼. It was trained on thousands of songs paired with metadata (in partnership with AudioSparx) and allows musicians and creators to generate royalty-free music and sound effects with simple prompts.
