### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
CodeGen – Salesforce’s open-source 16B-parameter language model for code generation, trained on massive natural language and code corpora; it turns English instructions into code in languages like Python or JavaScript and even powers GitHub Copilot-like capabilities ￼
#### dlproj2: 
ProGen – Salesforce Research’s protein-generating language model (trained on ~280 million amino acid sequences) that can generate novel protein sequences; remarkably, 73% of ProGen’s AI-designed enzymes were functional in lab tests, outperforming many natural proteins ￼
#### dlproj3: 
AI Economist – a multi-agent reinforcement learning research environment where AI “agents” and a simulated government explore tax policies for optimal social outcomes; a generative economic simulation by Salesforce to discover policies balancing equality and productivity【n/a】
#### dlproj4: 
BLIP – Salesforce’s Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training model that learns joint visual-text representations; it can generate rich captions for images and was used as a foundation for vision-language tasks like VQA and image retrieval【n/a】
#### dlproj5: 
CTRL – Salesforce’s 2019 1.6B-parameter controllable text generation model that introduced the ability to steer GPT-2–style generation via control codes (e.g., news, dialog) in the prompt, an early approach to guided generative text【n/a】

### Toxicity
#### toxicity: 7
#### tox_summary: Generally supportive, some strain
#### tox_justification: 
Salesforce has traditionally maintained a supportive, employee-friendly culture and still enjoys strong ratings, with around 81% of employees willing to recommend the company [oai_citation_attribution:50‡glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Salesforce-culture-Reviews-EI_IE11159.0,10_KH11,18.htm#:~:text=Salesforce%20Employee%20reviews%20about%20,friend%20based%20on%20Glassdoor%20reviews). However, the past two years have introduced some strain. Under pressure to improve efficiency, Salesforce cut about 10% of its workforce in early 2023 and even scaled back certain employee perks (like a monthly paid wellness day off) to reduce costs [oai_citation_attribution:51‡escalon.services](https://escalon.services/blog/professional-services/3-takeaways-from-salesforces-battle-to-balance-workplace-wellness-and-high-performance#:~:text=These%20reductions%20are%20largely%20an,engineering%20teams%20and%20other%20employees) [oai_citation_attribution:52‡escalon.services](https://escalon.services/blog/professional-services/3-takeaways-from-salesforces-battle-to-balance-workplace-wellness-and-high-performance#:~:text=Company,look%20like%20Salesforce%20is%20winning). These moves, driven by activist investor demands, were met with employee backlash and have dampened morale. Nonetheless, most of Salesforce’s workforce continues to view the culture as positive overall, just not as uniformly as before.
