### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: B+
#### dlproj1: 
Creator of a touchless self-checkout kiosk that uses computer vision to identify items instantly. Customers simply place their purchases on the Mashgin tray, and the system’s AI recognizes each product (even multiple items at once) without needing barcodes or manual input ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Uses a deep learning vision model that considers an item’s shape, size, color, texture, and even its gloss/reflectivity to identify it in any orientation. This multi-attribute recognition approach allows Mashgin to accurately distinguish thousands of products in diverse environments for real-time checkout ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Continuously improves via data: the system can learn new items in seconds, and with over 800 million transactions processed, its algorithms have become highly reliable. Mashgin’s AI gets more accurate with each use, making it increasingly adept at recognizing an ever-growing catalog of products in the field ￼.
