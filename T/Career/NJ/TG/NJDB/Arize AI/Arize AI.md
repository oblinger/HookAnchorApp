### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Arize Phoenix – an open-source observability and evaluation tool for LLMs that uses embeddings and LLM-as-a-metric to trace and visualize model decisions, helping developers identify hallucinations or errors in chatbot outputs and debug them interactively.
#### dlproj2: 
LLM-as-a-Judge – Arize’s approach (and tooling) for using one LLM to evaluate another’s responses on dimensions like factuality, relevance, or safety, enabling automated quality evaluation for agents and RAG systems without ground-truth answers ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Arize AX (GenAI) – a unified platform for end-to-end LLM app development and monitoring, which provides tracing of agent decision steps, prompt management, dataset slicing, and evaluation dashboards so enterprises can rapidly iterate and safely deploy generative AI agents ￼ ￼.
