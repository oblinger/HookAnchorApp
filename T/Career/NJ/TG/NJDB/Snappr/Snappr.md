Snappr Photo Analyzer – an AI-driven tool (available free) that evaluates the quality and effectiveness of profile photos. It uses computer vision to assess features like brightness, sharpness, contrast, and facial expression. For example, the Photo Analyzer can score how “professional” a LinkedIn headshot looks and provide feedback on how to improve it ￼. (Snappr has specialized versions like a dating photo analyzer to gauge dating profile pictures.)

AI Photo Editing – Snappr’s platform leverages AI for automated photo editing tasks. This includes an AI background remover that can instantly separate a subject from the background or replace it, as well as AI retouching tools for color correction, blemish removal, and enhancement of image quality. These AI features let businesses (e. g. e-commerce marketplaces) process large volumes of images quickly and consistently without manual Photoshop work ￼ ￼.

Photography Insights – Snappr applies deep learning research to real-world photography trends. For instance, it analyzed millions of professional headshots to determine what attributes make a profile photo successful. Its AI was used to find correlations (like smile intensity or dress color) with LinkedIn photo engagement ￼, providing data-driven advice for taking better photos. Snappr also uses image recognition AI in its consumer services (like matching customers with photographers based on photo style).
