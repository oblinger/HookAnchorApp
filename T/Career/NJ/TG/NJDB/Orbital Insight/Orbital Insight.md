#### dlproj1: 
Satellite imagery analytics – Uses deep learning (CNNs) at scale to analyze satellite and aerial images for economic and environmental insights. For example, Orbital Insight mapped global deforestation in partnership with WRI by processing 600k satellite images, using AI to flag new roads or plantations encroaching on virgin rainforest ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Synthetic data for NGA – In a project with NGA, Orbital Insight is developing computer vision models with synthetic satellite imagery. By partnering with Rendered.ai and academia, they generate artificial overhead images to augment training data, improving object detection performance for intelligence applications ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Supply chain monitoring – Deployed AI to track infrastructure and supply chain activity worldwide. Orbital’s algorithms (accelerated by GPU clusters) can count cars in parking lots, measure oil storage via tank shadows, and generally detect patterns in geospatial data for economic or real-estate indicators ￼.
