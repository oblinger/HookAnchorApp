#### dlproj1: 
OpenAI Fine-Tuning Integration – W&B developed a logger and dashboard integration for OpenAI’s fine-tuning API, allowing teams to automatically track experiments when fine-tuning GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 models (metrics, parameters, and datasets) with just a few lines of code ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Azure + W&B for LLMs – W&B partnered with Microsoft to enable enterprise fine-tuning of large language models on Azure. This collaboration lets Azure OpenAI Service users use W&B to monitor training runs and analyze model performance, simplifying the adaptation of GPT-4-family models to proprietary data ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Generative AI Evaluation – W&B has been at the forefront of generative AI research support, providing tools to evaluate and visualize LLM outputs. For example, W&B’s team has hosted conversations with leaders like Stability AI’s Emad Mostaque on model advances ￼ and built instrumentation to compare LLMs’ performance on tasks, helping researchers identify strengths and weaknesses in different models.
