#### mission: 
To solve the world’s most challenging computational problems and bring artificial intelligence to life ￼.
### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
StyleGAN – GAN architecture (2018) from NVIDIA that generates high-resolution photorealistic images (e.g. human faces) with controllable style attributes, advancing the state of generative adversarial networks ￼ ￼
#### dlproj2: 
GauGAN – deep learning model (named after artist Gauguin) that turns simple doodles or segmentation maps into stunning, lifelike landscape images, using GAN-based image synthesis with breathtaking ease ￼
#### dlproj3: 
eDiff-I – “Ensemble of Diffusion Models” by NVIDIA Research, a next-gen text-to-image diffusion model that offers unprecedented fidelity and alignment between text and image, with capabilities like instant style transfer and intuitive edits ￼
#### dlproj4: 
Instant NeRF – Neural Radiance Fields implementation that uses a fast multiresolution hash encoding to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images extremely quickly, allowing photorealistic novel view synthesis in seconds (Time’s Best Invention 2022) ￼
#### dlproj5: 
Megatron LM – NVIDIA’s framework for training very large transformer models (basis of MT-NLG), which introduced efficient model-parallel and pipeline-parallel techniques to scale generative LMs to hundreds of billions of parameters ￼

### Toxicity
#### toxicity: 10
#### tox_summary: Exceptionally supportive environment
#### tox_justification: 
NVIDIA’s workplace stands out as extremely supportive and non-toxic. The company has been among the top five on Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work list for four years running, and it rose to #2 in 2024 [oai_citation_attribution:44‡blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-life-glassdoor-best-place-work-2024/#:~:text=NVIDIA%20continues%20to%20be%20among,of%20best%20employers%20for%202024). An overwhelming 94% of employees would recommend NVIDIA to a friend [oai_citation_attribution:45‡blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-life-glassdoor-best-place-work-2024/#:~:text=Some%2098,at%20NVIDIA%20to%20a%20friend). Employees frequently praise the culture – one engineer noted that 'teams are supportive of each other and employees love their work' [oai_citation_attribution:46‡blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-life-glassdoor-best-place-work-2024/#:~:text=,we%20succeed%20together%2C%E2%80%9D%20another%20noted). This reflects a remarkably positive culture with virtually no signs of toxicity.
