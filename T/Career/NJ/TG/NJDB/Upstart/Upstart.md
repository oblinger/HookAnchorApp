#### dlproj1: 
Model 19 & PTM – Upstart’s 19th-generation lending model introduced a Payment Transition Model that learns from intermediate loan delinquency states (current, delinquent, etc.) to better predict defaults, significantly improving credit risk accuracy ￼
#### dlproj2: 
Model 18 (APR Feature) – an earlier Upstart model version that first incorporated loan APR as an input feature, a change that produced a large jump in predictive accuracy for borrower risk ￼
#### dlproj3: 
Fair Lending LDAs – Upstart’s AI fairness research uses Less Discriminatory Alternative analyses to find credit models that reduce bias against protected classes while preserving accuracy in lending decisions ￼
