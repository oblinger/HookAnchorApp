### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
MT-NLG 530B – Megatron-Turing NLG, a 530-billion–parameter Transformer LM (co-developed with NVIDIA) that set a new standard for large-scale natural language generation ￼
#### dlproj2: 
Kosmos-1 – multimodal large language model that can perceive images and text, follow instructions, and perform visual question answering and reasoning ￼
#### dlproj3: 
VALL-E – neural codec text-to-speech model that can synthesize a person’s voice from a 3-second sample, enabling zero-shot personalized speech generation with high fidelity ￼
#### dlproj4: 
NUWA-Infinity – multimodal generative model that produces arbitrarily high-resolution images or long-duration videos from text or image inputs (via a two-stage autoregressive approach) ￼
#### dlproj5: 
ResNet (Deep Residual Nets) – ultra-deep CNN (152 layers) by MSR that won ImageNet 2015, using “residual” connections to train networks 5× deeper than previously possible ￼
#### dlproj6: 
DeepSpeed – easy-to-use deep learning optimization library (open-sourced by Microsoft) that enables unprecedented scale (trillion+ parameter training) and speed for model training/inference ￼
#### dlproj7: 
BioGPT – domain-specific generative Transformer (by Microsoft Research) trained on large biomedical corpora for text generation and mining in the biomedical domain ￼

### Toxicity
#### toxicity: 9
#### tox_summary: Highly supportive and inclusive
#### tox_justification: 
Microsoft is widely regarded as having a very supportive and healthy workplace culture. In a 2022 global survey, it was ranked the #1 large company for corporate culture [oai_citation_attribution:38‡businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/employers-comparably-list-of-best-global-company-culture-2022-3#:~:text=For%20this%20ranking%2C%20employee%20ratings,March%202021%20through%20March%202022), reflecting extremely high employee approval. Leadership under CEO Satya Nadella is often praised for being empathetic and visionary, contributing to a more inclusive environment [oai_citation_attribution:39‡businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/employers-comparably-list-of-best-global-company-culture-2022-3#:~:text=Industry%3A%20Technology). Microsoft has also been proactive in addressing problems (for example, improving its sexual harassment policies after a third-party review [oai_citation_attribution:40‡cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/15/microsoft-will-update-sexual-harassment-policy-after-arentfox-report.html#:~:text=Microsoft%20will%20update%20sexual%20harassment,report%20showed%20shortcomings%20in)). Overall, Microsoft’s culture is seen as very positive and largely free of toxicity.
