Palantir AIP – Palantir’s new Artificial Intelligence Platform that integrates large language models (like GPT-4) into private defense and enterprise data environments. AIP acts as a secure “copilot” allowing users to query, monitor, and manage operations through natural language while respecting fine-grained security controls ￼
#### dlproj2: 
Foundry & Gotham – Palantir’s flagship platforms now embed generative AI capabilities (via AIP) to help analysts generate insights from Big Data. For example, Gotham (defense) can use LLMs to draft reports from multi-source intel, and Foundry (commercial) can generate Python code or SQL for analysts based on plain English requests ￼
