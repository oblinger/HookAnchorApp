To revolutionize how humans interact with technology by enabling businesses and developers to create context-aware, personalized, and efficient AI assistants that enhance user experiences ￼.
### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)

DIET NLU Model – Rasa’s Dual Intent and Entity Transformer is a multitask deep learning model for natural language understanding. DIET uses a transformer architecture to jointly predict user intents and extract entities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with less training data and compute than large pretrained language models ￼. It’s open-source and powers Rasa’s NLU, enabling developers to build chatbots that understand user messages with high accuracy while being efficient to train.
#### dlproj2: 
Intentless Dialogue Policy – Rasa introduced an intentless conversational model that leverages large language models to manage dialogue without hand-crafted intents ￼. Implemented as the IntentlessPolicy in Rasa, it uses an LLM to interpret off-script user input and decide the next action when no predefined rule applies. Crucially, the system is designed to avoid wild LLM generation – it only chooses from valid actions and known responses, preventing hallucinations ￼. This approach makes Rasa assistants more flexible (able to handle unexpected user requests) while maintaining reliability by integrating with Rasa’s rule-based dialogue framework.
#### dlproj3: 
LLM-Based User Simulators – A Rasa research initiative using generative models to create simulated users for testing chatbot conversations. By prompting an LLM to behave like a user with various goals, Rasa can generate entire conversation trajectories to stress-test dialogue policies ￼. These simulators produce varied phrasing and dialogue turns (beyond the happy paths developers anticipate) ￼, helping uncover bugs or weaknesses in the assistant. This applied research accelerates development – bots can be tested against hundreds of simulated scenarios overnight, improving robustness before real users ever interact with them.
