X-Stream (Knowledge-as-a-Service) – Uniphore’s new platform for enterprise Knowledge AI. X-Stream transforms raw enterprise data (from various sources) into AI-ready knowledge and offers native support for Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflows. It provides the tools, connectors, and governance needed to build domain-specific generative AI applications (like conversational assistants or analytics) on one unified platform, accelerating the move from AI POCs to production ￼ ￼.

U-Analyze (Generative Edition) – an enhanced version of Uniphore’s interaction analytics solution powered by LLMs. This upgrade uses generative AI to synthesize insights from multimodal customer conversation data (voice, text, video). It can automatically summarize call topics, extract customer sentiment and intent, and even generate coaching notes for agents, enabling contact center leaders to monitor and improve performance with unprecedented ease ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Q for Sales – an AI-driven conversational intelligence tool for sales teams that analyzes emotional cues in virtual meetings. Q for Sales uses computer vision (facial expressions), tonal analysis (voice intonation), ASR, and NLP to gauge buyer sentiment and engagement in real time, giving sales reps live feedback and recommendations. By capturing the full emotional spectrum of sales calls and delivering real-time “EQ” insights, Q for Sales helps remote sellers build trust and close deals more effectively ￼ ￼.
