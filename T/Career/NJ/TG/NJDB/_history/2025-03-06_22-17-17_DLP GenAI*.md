The Brain’s neural network policies are trained on millions of grasp attempts, giving Covariant-powered robots the ability to generalize – e.g., a warehouse robot can pick up arbitrary products it’s never encountered before, achieving automation in e-commerce fulfillment that was previously impractical.                                                        | RFM-1 (Robotics Foundation Model) – Covariant’s Robotics Foundation Model 1 is a large-scale multimodal AI model designed for robotics ￼. It’s trained not only on internet-scale data (text and images, for broad semantic understanding) but also on an enormous dataset of real-world robotic interactions collected by Covariant over years ￼. RFM-1 gives robots a form of common sense about the physical world – for instance, understanding concepts of support, gravity, and object properties – which improves their reasoning and decision-making in new scenarios. Covariant reports that RFM-1 is the first foundation model deployed in hundreds of physical robots, where it powers capabilities like dynamic grasping and tool use in factories.                                                                                                                                                                     | AI-Driven Robotic Picking Deployments – Covariant has partnered with logistics automation companies (e.g. KNAPP) to deploy AI-powered picking robots in live production. One example is at McKesson, a major pharmaceutical distributor, which installed Covariant’s AI on KNAPP “Pick-it-Easy” robotic stations to handle pharmacy items. The Covariant-enabled robots can reliably pick and sort thousands of different products (from pill bottles to odd-shaped packages) with high precision, 24/7 ￼. These deployments, numbering in the hundreds of robots across retailers and 3PLs, demonstrate Covariant’s applied AI achieving less than <0.1% error rates and significant throughput gains in real warehouses ￼, validating the real-world performance of their deep learning robotics.                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                          |

| [[Glean]]                | a+   | B-    | B-   | Glean Chat Search – Glean’s Work AI platform includes an enterprise chat-based search assistant ￼. Employees can ask it questions like, “How do I access our VPN?” or “Summarize Project X design decisions,” and Glean will search across all company apps (Google Drive, Slack, Confluence, emails, etc.). Using LLMs with retrieval, it returns a direct answer or summary with citations and links to the source documents ￼. This generative Q&A approach saves time by providing users the exact info they need from their company’s knowledge, instead of a list of files to dig through.                                                                                                                                                         | Trusted Knowledge Fine-Tuning – To ensure accuracy and security, Glean uses a Trusted Knowledge Model approach. It continuously indexes enterprise data and fine-tunes its deep learning models on each organization’s content and graph (relationships between people, files, topics) ￼ ￼. The result is that Glean’s generative AI answers are contextually personalized (aware of the user’s role, team, and past activity) and always respect permissions (the AI won’t reveal info a user isn’t allowed to see) ￼ ￼. This applied research in grounding LLMs with company-specific training makes Glean’s answers uniquely relevant and trustworthy for each enterprise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Retrieval-Augmented Generation – Glean’s search utilizes retrieval-augmented generation, meaning it combines vector semantic search with generative AI. When a question is asked, Glean first retrieves relevant document snippets, then its LLM composes an answer using those snippets as context ￼. Every answer it generates is accompanied by citations back to the original content to assure verifiability ￼. By using this grounded generation approach, Glean minimizes hallucinations and ensures the AI stays “in sync” with the company’s actual knowledge.

| [[Rasa]]                 | b+   | C+    | B-   | DIET NLU Model – Rasa’s Dual Intent and Entity Transformer is a multitask deep learning model for natural language understanding. DIET uses a transformer architecture to jointly predict user intents and extract entities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with less training data and compute than large pretrained language models ￼. It’s open-source and powers Rasa’s NLU, enabling developers to build chatbots that understand user messages with high accuracy while being efficient to train.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Intentless Dialogue Policy – Rasa introduced an intentless conversational model that leverages large language models to manage dialogue without hand-crafted intents ￼. Implemented as the IntentlessPolicy in Rasa, it uses an LLM to interpret off-script user input and decide the next action when no predefined rule applies. Crucially, the system is designed to avoid wild LLM generation – it only chooses from valid actions and known responses, preventing hallucinations ￼. This approach makes Rasa assistants more flexible (able to handle unexpected user requests) while maintaining reliability by integrating with Rasa’s rule-based dialogue framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | LLM-Based User Simulators – A Rasa research initiative using generative models to create simulated users for testing chatbot conversations. By prompting an LLM to behave like a user with various goals, Rasa can generate entire conversation trajectories to stress-test dialogue policies ￼. These simulators produce varied phrasing and dialogue turns (beyond the happy paths developers anticipate) ￼, helping uncover bugs or weaknesses in the assistant. This applied research accelerates development – bots can be tested against hundreds of simulated scenarios overnight, improving robustness before real users ever interact with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                          |

| [[Vectara]]              | b+   | B-    | B    | Grounded Conversational Search – Vectara’s neural “search-as-a-service” platform delivers answer-focused search results. Instead of only returning a list of documents, Vectara uses generative AI to produce a direct answer synthesized from relevant text, and crucially, it grounds each answer with source citations ￼ ￼. For example, a user asks a complex question on a knowledge base – Vectara will retrieve the top passages and then its LLM generates a unified answer (with footnotes linking back to those passages). This reduces user effort and gives confidence in the answer’s accuracy by showing exactly where information came from (addressing AI hallucination concerns).                                                       | Zero-Shot Learning Engine – Vectara’s system employs a form of continuous zero-shot learning for enterprise data. As new documents are added to a customer’s index, the AI can immediately incorporate that knowledge when answering queries, without needing to re-train a model offline ￼. Vectara’s architecture streams new data into the vector index in seconds, so if an employee uploads a file or an FAQ is updated, any subsequent question will “know” about it. This enables truly real-time, up-to-date generative responses (a stark contrast to typical LLM deployments that rely on fixed training data).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | “Boomerang” Retrieval Model – An applied research achievement by Vectara is its Boomerang model – a state-of-the-art multilingual retrieval model integrated into its platform ￼. Boomerang is trained to produce high-quality semantic embeddings for text in many languages, improving search relevance across diverse content. In Vectara’s pipeline, better retrieval means the generative answer gets the best possible context to work from ￼. Internal benchmarks showed Boomerang outperforming other embedding models on recall and precision, which translates to more accurate answers in generative search. (This focus on strong dual encoder models is part of Vectara’s “Neural Search” DNA and a key differentiator of their GenAI service.)                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                          |
