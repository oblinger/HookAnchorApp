To create the best AI in the world, starting by building the most powerful AI accelerator on the planet ￼.
### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Advancing photonic AI hardware – co-founder Mitchell Nahmias’s research showed that optical chips can outperform electronic ones for neural network math. In a 2020 study, photonic hardware proved significantly superior in speed, energy efficiency, and compute density for multiply-accumulate operations in deep learning ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Designing a silicon-photonic AI accelerator aimed at generative AI workloads. Its architecture provides high-bandwidth access to multi-terabyte memory pools, enabling fast inference on gigantic models without needing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) ￼. (Their Gen-1 cards natively integrate with PyTorch and deliver compute/memory throughput on par with top GPUs.)
#### dlproj3: 
Aiming to build a photonics-driven AI supercomputer. Luminous’s ultimate goal is a new class of AI system with unparalleled compute, memory, and interconnect bandwidth – “the most powerful AI accelerator on the planet” – by integrating optical computing into large-scale AI infrastructure ￼.
