### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlproj1: 
Copy.ai Chat – an AI chat assistant for business content that goes beyond ChatGPT. It offers model flexibility (users can switch between OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Anthropic’s Claude models on the fly) ￼ and integrates with the user’s own knowledge base. Through a feature called Infobase, teams can store company facts (products, value props, etc.) and recall them in chat with hashtags, ensuring the AI’s answers stay consistent and on-brand ￼. Users can even attach reference documents in a chat session, giving the AI context to produce more precise, tailored outputs.
#### dlproj2: 
Brand Voice – Copy.ai provides a Brand Voice feature (part of its “Intelligence Layer”) that ensures all AI-generated content aligns with the client’s unique tone and style. Users feed in writing samples that embody their brand’s voice, and the system analyzes them to create a custom voice profile ￼ ￼. When generating, Copy.ai then injects the brand’s distinctive tone and terminology into the output. This allows enterprises to automate writing tasks at scale without losing their brand identity – every tweet, blog, and ad “sounds like you” ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
AI Workflows & Agents – a no-code system to automate complex content tasks by chaining multiple AI actions. Copy.ai’s Workflows let users stitch together steps like web search, text generation, data lookup, and more into a single pipeline. For example, a “Blog Post Workflow” might research a topic, draft an outline, then expand each section – all automatically. These Workflows run on Copy.ai’s cloud and can be triggered at scale. By automating tedious multi-step processes, the platform enables teams (Marketing, Sales, etc.) to achieve “GTM automation” – speeding up go-to-market tasks from prospecting emails to content localization ￼. (Advanced users can even insert custom code or connect APIs via Actions to extend the workflow capabilities.) ￼.
