To understand human language by enabling developers with the most advanced speech AI transcription and understanding capabilities ￼.
### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Nova-3 Multilingual STT – Deepgram’s state-of-the-art speech-to-text model offering best-in-class transcription accuracy on challenging audio. Nova-3 performs real-time transcription across 10 languages (even within a single conversation), an industry-first capability achieved by training on massive synthetic code-switched data and real-world speech, enabling seamless multilingual recognition without separate models ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
End‑to‑End Speech-to-Speech Model – An experimental generative speech system from Deepgram that converts input speech directly to output speech in another language or form without converting to text in between. This speech-to-speech (STS) model preserves nuances like tone and emotion and is a major step toward fluid, human-like voice assistants. (Deepgram announced in 2025 that their model achieved this direct speech generation, paving the way for more natural real-time voice translation and responsiveness) ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Genesys Integration – A collaboration between Deepgram and Genesys to power next-gen contact center AI. Deepgram’s deep learning ASR was integrated into Genesys Cloud, enabling generative AI features like voicebot IVR, live agent assist, auto-diarized transcripts and call summarization ￼. This partnership allows enterprise users to benefit from Deepgram’s fast, accurate speech recognition as part of an end-to-end AI customer service solution, improving automation and analytics in call centers.
