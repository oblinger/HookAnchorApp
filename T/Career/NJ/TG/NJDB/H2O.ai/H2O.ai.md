h2oGPT (2023) – An open-source ChatGPT-like generative AI released by H2O.ai for enterprise use. The model (available in 12B and 20B-parameter versions) was fine-tuned on high-quality instruction-answer pairs and allows organizations to privately deploy chatbots that answer questions, summarize documents, and generate content, with full control over data and prompts ￼ ￼
#### dlproj2: 
H2O LLM Studio (2023) – A no-code platform for fine-tuning large language models, launched alongside h2oGPT. LLM Studio provides an easy UI for users to choose an open-source base model (7–20B parameters), input their own training data, and produce a custom “GPT” tailored to their domain. It automates the RLHF/fine-tuning process, lowering the barrier to adapt LLMs for specific applications ￼ ￼
#### dlproj3: 
Hydrogen Torch (2022) – A no-code deep learning training engine developed by H2O.ai’s grandmaster data scientists ￼. Hydrogen Torch automates the building of state-of-the-art models for computer vision, NLP, and audio tasks without coding. Users can train models for image classification, object detection, or text analytics via a simple interface, drastically accelerating AI development for unstructured data ￼ ￼
#### dlproj4: 
Driverless AI (2017) – An automated machine learning platform that uses advanced deep learning and autoML techniques to accelerate model development. Driverless AI handles data prep, feature engineering (often using neural network-derived features), model selection and hyperparameter tuning automatically. It produces high-accuracy models (including Gradient Boosting and DNNs) and provides interpretability via an MLI module, allowing enterprises to deploy robust AI models quickly without hand-coding ￼ ￼
