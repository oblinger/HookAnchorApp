### funding_justification: Largest known ~$60M in Jun 2021 (~44 months ago); base=60/45≈1.33
### proj1: Pharma.AI (drug discovery engine with generative models)
### justification: 
Insilico Medicine uses generative AI to design new molecules and optimize drug candidates. It has an AI platform that generated a novel drug now in clinical trials, illustrating how generative models can significantly reduce the time and cost of developing new medicines [oai_citation_attribution:85‡eweek.com](https://www.eweek.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai-startups/#:~:text=Insilico%20Medicine) [oai_citation_attribution:86‡eweek.com](https://www.eweek.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai-startups/#:~:text=,Generative%20Biologics%2C%20Chemistry42%2C%20and%20inClinico)
