Command Model Family – Cohere’s flagship large language models for text generation. Cohere Command models are highly scalable LLMs optimized for following user instructions while balancing strong performance with efficiency ￼. (e.g. the 2024 Command R7B variant delivers fast, high-quality generative AI even on modest hardware ￼.)

Project Aya (Multilingual LLMs) – an open science initiative by Cohere’s research lab to support languages beyond English. In 2023–24 Cohere released Aya 1.0 (a 13B parameter model covering 101 languages) and Aya Expanse models (8B & 35B) to narrow the language gap ￼. These models (openly available on HuggingFace) significantly outperform other LLMs of similar size on multilingual benchmarks ￼.
Aya Expanse (Multilingual AI) – an open science initiative to develop state-of-the-art multilingual models (8B–32B parameters) that match or surpass monolingual model performance, expanding AI capabilities across diverse languages
#### dlproj3: 
Embed v3 – Cohere’s advanced text embedding model for semantic search and retrieval. Embed v3 can evaluate document relevance and meaning, ranking results by quality ￼. It uses a compression-aware training approach to produce embeddings that power more accurate search results while being cost-efficient at scale ￼ ￼.
North for Banking (RBC & Cohere) – a secure generative AI platform co-developed with Royal Bank of Canada, integrating Cohere’s foundation models with RBC’s data to create an AI assistant tailored for financial services with industry-specific fine-tuning and privacy
