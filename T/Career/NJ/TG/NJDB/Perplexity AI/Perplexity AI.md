Perplexity Answer Engine – an AI-powered search assistant that combines web search with a large language model to answer user questions. Perplexity generates direct answers with cited sources, offering a conversational interface for research ￼. It handles 400+ million queries per month, using a ensemble of models (like GPT-4 and open Llama variants) and a custom query planner to retrieve and synthesize relevant information from the web ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Conversational Copilot – Perplexity’s Copilot feature turns search into a dialogue by suggesting follow-up questions and refinements. After answering a query, the system proposes likely next questions to clarify or go deeper, which users can click to continue the discussion ￼. This iterative Q&A approach (unique among search engines) helps users explore topics in depth and narrow in on exactly what they need.
#### dlproj3: 
Deep Research – an AI research analyst mode that Perplexity introduced in 2025 ￼. When a user activates Deep Research, the system autonomously performs dozens of searches, reads hundreds of sources, and then synthesizes a comprehensive report ￼. The output is a structured summary with citations, generated in minutes. On benchmarks, Perplexity’s Deep Research mode achieved ~94% factual accuracy on the OpenAI SimpleQA test, outperforming other QA models ￼.
