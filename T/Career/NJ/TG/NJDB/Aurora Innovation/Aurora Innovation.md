Proposer-Ranker Architecture – Aurora’s motion planning AI uses a two-tier system: it proposes a broad set of possible driving behaviors and then ranks them by cost, executing the highest-scoring feasible plan. This ensures “correctness by construction” by never considering options that violate dynamic feasibility or safety constraints ￼ ￼
#### dlproj2: 
Transparent & Verifiable AI – Aurora’s self-driving software is built with internal interpretable predictions (e.g. traffic light state, other actors’ intentions) at each decision step, allowing engineers to pinpoint why the car behaved a certain way. This modular transparency enables rigorous validation and root-cause fixes, as opposed to opaque end-to-end approaches ￼ ￼
#### dlproj3: 
GNN-Based Behavior Model – Aurora pioneered using graph neural networks with attention (Transformer-style) for learning driving policy. This generative behavior model approach, which uses graphs of agents and relationships as input, is now increasingly adopted across the AV industry to produce more human-like driving decisions ￼
