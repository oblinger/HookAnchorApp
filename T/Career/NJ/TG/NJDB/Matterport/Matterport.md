### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)

Cortex AI (2019) – Matterport’s proprietary AI engine for 3D reconstruction. Cortex is a deep learning-based system that converts 2D imagery from panoramic cameras into dimensionally accurate 3D digital twins. It combines computer vision, image processing, and neural networks to automate the creation of immersive 3D models of real spaces, enabling thousands of captures per day without manual post-processing ￼
#### dlproj2: 
Property Intelligence (2022) – A suite of AI analytics for Matterport digital twins that uses deep learning to automatically extract property insights. For any scanned building, the system can compute metrics like total floor area, room dimensions (ceiling heights, wall lengths), detect objects or features, and output informed estimates. These AI-derived details – generated from Matterport’s vast spatial data library of billions of sq. ft. – help in facilities management, interior design, and real estate marketing ￼
#### dlproj3: 
Project Genesis (2023) – A generative AI initiative to allow on-the-fly editing and enhancement of 3D spaces. Genesis combines Matterport’s computer vision breakthroughs (Cortex, Property Intelligence) with new generative models so that a digital twin is no longer static but “dynamic” – users can automatically remove furniture, swap design elements, or re-stage a room in 3D. For example, Genesis can generate alternate interior layouts or virtual renovations within a captured space, leveraging Matterport’s 3D data to ensure all AI-generated modifications are spatially and dimensionally accurate ￼ ￼
#### dlproj4: 
Defurnishing AI (2024) – Matterport’s Vision & Learning research team (with partners) developed a generative model that can “defurnish” an indoor panorama – i.e. remove furniture via AI inpainting. Using a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion pipeline, it segments furniture in 360° images and fills in the room as if empty ￼ ￼. This project, presented at CVPR 2024, showcases how generative models can synthetically declutter or modify real estate visuals, a capability being integrated into Matterport’s platform to aid virtual staging and space planning.
