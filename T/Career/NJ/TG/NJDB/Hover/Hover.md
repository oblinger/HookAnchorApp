### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
Uses computer vision and deep learning to generate 3D models of buildings from smartphone photos. Hover’s app transforms a handful of exterior pictures into a precise, measurable 3D reconstruction of the property (capturing all walls, windows, roof dimensions, etc.), eliminating the need for manual measurements ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
Developed an AI-powered design visualization tool that leverages generative models to help homeowners and contractors. For example, Hover’s Instant Design can turn ordinary home photos into realistic images of potential renovations (new siding, paint colors, etc.) within seconds, requiring no design expertise ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Introduced a new blueprint-to-3D conversion solution: by applying its deep learning tech, Hover can take 2D architectural plans (blueprints) and automatically produce a detailed 3D model with full measurements. This lets builders get the same rich 3D data from plans as they would from on-site photos ￼.
