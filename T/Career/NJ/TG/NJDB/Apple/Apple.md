### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
AXLearn – Apple’s open-source JAX-based training framework for large-scale AI, enabling efficient training of foundation models on distributed accelerators ￼
#### dlproj2: 
Neural TTS (Siri Voice) – on-device text-to-speech system using deep learning (Tacotron2 + WaveRNN) with optimizations to run 5× faster than real time on server and 3× on an iPhone, producing natural 24 kHz speech for Siri ￼
#### dlproj3: 
Personal Voice – new iOS 17 accessibility feature that fine-tunes a speech model on 15 minutes of a user’s voice on-device, then generates a custom synthetic voice matching the user for use in FaceTime or Assistive Communication ￼
#### dlproj4: 
Face ID Neural Engine – Apple’s on-device deep learning system (with a dedicated neural chip) that generates a depth map and recognizes users’ faces for authentication, using dual neural networks to adapt to appearance changes (applied DL in security)【n/a】
#### dlproj5: 
Diffusion in Pixelmator – Apple collaborated to integrate Core ML–accelerated Stable Diffusion for image generation on Mac, enabling creators to generate art from text prompts locally using Apple Silicon optimizations【n/a】

### Toxicity
#### toxicity: 7
#### tox_summary: Mixed support; some toxic issues
#### tox_justification: 
Apple’s workplace offers many positive aspects but also suffers from some toxic elements. Many employees enjoy working at Apple – the company has about a 4.2/5 rating on Glassdoor and 81% would recommend it [oai_citation_attribution:10‡glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Apple-work-life-balance-Reviews-EI_IE1138.0,5_KH6,23.htm#:~:text=Apple%20has%20an%20overall%20rating,at%20Apple%20to%20a). However, a significant number of staff have reported issues like discrimination and harassment being ignored by management. In 2021, the #AppleToo movement gathered hundreds of employee testimonials, and the main thread in these stories was a 'culture of secrecy' where serious problems were often ignored by HR [oai_citation_attribution:11‡computerweekly.com](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252506157/Apple-workers-challenge-company-on-toxic-workplace-culture#:~:text=A%20group%20of%20current%20and,HR%29%20department) [oai_citation_attribution:12‡computerweekly.com](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252506157/Apple-workers-challenge-company-on-toxic-workplace-culture#:~:text=The%20group%20claim%20the%20main,by%20the%20firm%E2%80%99s%20HR%20representatives). Thus, while Apple is supportive for some, it has notable internal culture problems.
