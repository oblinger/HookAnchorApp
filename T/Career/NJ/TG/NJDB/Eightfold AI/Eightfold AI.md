### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)

Deep Learning Talent Matching – Eightfold’s Talent Intelligence Platform uses deep neural networks to analyze millions of resumes and career paths, identifying the skills and career trajectories of each person ￼. Rather than keyword matching, it predicts a candidate’s potential (e.g. ability to learn new skills or transition roles) by comparing their profile to patterns learned from global talent data. This applied deep learning helps companies find non-obvious fits — for example, suggesting candidates with adaptable skills who might be great in a role even if they haven’t held the exact title before.

Generative Talent Copilots – Eightfold announced two generative AI copilots integrated into its platform ￼. The Employee Copilot acts like a personal career assistant, answering employees’ questions and providing recommendations (for instance, suggesting what skills to develop for a desired role). The Recruiter Copilot helps HR by drafting job descriptions, crafting personalized candidate outreach, and summarizing applicant profiles in natural language ￼. These copilots use LLMs to understand context and generate text, streamlining talent management workflows (and all content is grounded in Eightfold’s talent data to ensure relevance).
#### dlproj3: 
Emerging Skills Insights – Eightfold leverages generative AI to track and integrate emerging skills and roles into its talent database in real time. As the job market evolves (for example, the rise of prompts engineering or new programming languages), Eightfold’s AI identifies these trends by processing vast amounts of online data and updates its models accordingly ￼ ￼. This means recruiters can query the platform for novel skills and get candidates who have them, and organizations can foresee skill gaps. The generative AI component summarizes labor market shifts and suggests how a company’s workforce can adapt, making talent strategy more proactive.
