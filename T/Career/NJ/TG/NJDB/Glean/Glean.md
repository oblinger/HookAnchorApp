Glean Chat Search – Glean’s Work AI platform includes an enterprise chat-based search assistant ￼. Employees can ask it questions like, “How do I access our VPN?” or “Summarize Project X design decisions,” and Glean will search across all company apps (Google Drive, Slack, Confluence, emails, etc.). Using LLMs with retrieval, it returns a direct answer or summary with citations and links to the source documents ￼. This generative Q&A approach saves time by providing users the exact info they need from their company’s knowledge, instead of a list of files to dig through.
#### dlproj2: 
Trusted Knowledge Fine-Tuning – To ensure accuracy and security, Glean uses a Trusted Knowledge Model approach. It continuously indexes enterprise data and fine-tunes its deep learning models on each organization’s content and graph (relationships between people, files, topics) ￼ ￼. The result is that Glean’s generative AI answers are contextually personalized (aware of the user’s role, team, and past activity) and always respect permissions (the AI won’t reveal info a user isn’t allowed to see) ￼ ￼. This applied research in grounding LLMs with company-specific training makes Glean’s answers uniquely relevant and trustworthy for each enterprise.
#### dlproj3: 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation – Glean’s search utilizes retrieval-augmented generation, meaning it combines vector semantic search with generative AI. When a question is asked, Glean first retrieves relevant document snippets, then its LLM composes an answer using those snippets as context ￼. Every answer it generates is accompanied by citations back to the original content to assure verifiability ￼. By using this grounded generation approach, Glean minimizes hallucinations and ensures the AI stays “in sync” with the company’s actual knowledge. (This strategy has positioned Glean as a leading example of trusted GenAI in enterprise search ￼.)
