SymbioDCS Platform – Symbio’s core product is SymbioDCS, an AI-driven robot control platform that makes industrial robots more adaptive. It acts as middleware allowing robots to use sensor data and AI algorithms for real-time decision-making ￼. For example, instead of static robot motions, SymbioDCS lets a robot adjust its path if a part is misaligned on the assembly line. The platform uses reinforcement learning and advanced control to continually optimize tasks. This has enabled use-cases like moving line assembly, where robots perform intricate tasks (screwing, dispensing) on car bodies as they move down the production line, something traditionally very hard to synchronize ￼. SymbioDCS’s Python-based framework has been deployed in major automotive plants to simplify robot programming and achieve more flexible automation.

Toyota Assembly Line AI – Toyota Motor North America collaborated with Symbio to upgrade some of its highest-volume assembly lines with AI. Using SymbioDCS, Toyota has robots on the Camry/RAV4 production line that can learn and adapt to new assembly procedures without extensive reprogramming ￼. One implemented task is automated wax application: previously done with fixed settings, now the robot (using Symbio’s AI) dynamically adjusts how it applies protective wax as each vehicle moves along, improving consistency without stopping the line. Toyota’s engineers reported increased efficiency and quality, as well as reduced ergonomic risk for human workers, by leveraging Symbio’s AI to handle repetitive or fine-detail tasks on both traditional and hybrid/EV lines ￼.

Ford Transmission Project – Ford deployed Symbio’s AI software on robots assembling auto transmissions (e.g. for the Bronco Sport and other models) ￼. This project addressed a pain point: installing heavy, precision-fit components like torque converters. Symbio-enabled robots at Ford use AI to “learn” from each assembly attempt — they analyze force/position data to improve the next cycle’s motion. Over time, the robots optimize how they align and insert the parts, achieving faster and smoother assembly than traditional programming. In fact, Ford observed about a 15% improvement in cycle time, and the adaptation time for new product variants dropped by more than half thanks to Symbio’s machine learning approach ￼. This collaboration not only improved production metrics but also validated Symbio’s premise that AI can make factory automation more agile and data-driven.
