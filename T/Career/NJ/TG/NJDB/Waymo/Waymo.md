### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)

Waymo Open Dataset (2019) – A large-scale autonomous driving dataset (sensor data from cameras and LiDAR) released to the public to fuel state-of-the-art deep learning research in self-driving cars. It has enabled academic and industry researchers to develop and benchmark perception and prediction models for autonomous vehicles ￼
#### dlproj2: 
GINA-3D (2023) – Generative Implicit Neural Assets in 3D, a research project by Waymo and Stanford (CVPR 2023). GINA-3D uses generative models to create realistic 3D models of vehicles and pedestrians from real-world driving data. Trained on over 520k images of vehicles and people from the Waymo Open Dataset, it produces diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets (geometry and texture) for simulation, improving the richness of virtual test environments ￼ ￼
#### dlproj3: 
EMMA (2024) – End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving, a new Waymo model that leverages Google’s Gemini LLM as part of an end-to-end self-driving network. EMMA takes raw sensor data (camera images) and map text as input and generates future vehicle trajectories, performing joint tasks of motion planning, object detection, and road comprehension. It demonstrated that integrating a multimodal large language model can improve planning and perception by sharing a unified “language” representation of the driving scene ￼ ￼
