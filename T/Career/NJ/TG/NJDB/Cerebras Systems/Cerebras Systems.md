### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: B ?
#### dlproj1: 
Open GPT models on Wafer-Scale – Cerebras trained and open-sourced seven GPT models (ranging from 111M to 13B parameters) for the research community ￼. All models were trained on Andromeda, Cerebras’s 16-wafer CS-2 supercomputer, demonstrating the scalability of wafer-scale AI and providing ready-to-use generative language models.
#### dlproj2: 
Wafer-scale 120T support – Designed a hardware-software architecture (MemoryX and Weight Streaming) that enables a single Cerebras CS-2 system to train models up to 120 trillion parameters ￼. This “brain-scale” AI capability means Cerebras can handle models 100× larger than GPT-3, by streaming model weights from external memory, pointing toward future generative models of unprecedented size ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Andromeda AI supercomputer – Built the Andromeda AI supercluster with 13.5 million cores (16 CS-2 wafers). It achieved near-linear scaling on large language model training, e.g. efficiently training GPT-3 and GPT-NeoX models without the usual distributed-compute bottlenecks ￼. This enables faster experimentation and iteration in generative model research.
