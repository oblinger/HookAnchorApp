#### dlproj1: 
Conversational Email + AI Writer – an AI-powered email outreach product that turns marketing emails into two-way conversations. Launched in 2022 and enhanced in 2023 with generative AI, it uses GPT-4 (combined with 6sense’s intent data and predictive analytics) to automatically draft highly personalized emails and even manage the replies. The AI Writer generates custom email text aimed at eliciting responses, and the system’s “auto-replies” feature uses an AI agent to continue the thread or hand off to sales at the right time.
#### dlproj2: 
AI Email Writer for Sales – a generative feature inside 6sense Sales Intelligence that helps sales reps compose one-to-one emails. It pulls in information about the target account (from CRM records and 6sense’s people & intent data) and, via generative AI, produces a tailored outreach email. This saves reps time in crafting pitches and ensures messages are informed by all available data on the prospect.
#### dlproj3: 
Pipeline Intelligence – 6sense’s platform, branded “Revenue AI,” applies machine learning to identify high-potential accounts and recommend next-best actions. Recent AI advancements include Model Lifecycle Management, which continuously retrains the predictive models on new data to maintain accuracy ￼. Combining generative AI for engagement and predictive AI for targeting, 6sense aims to automate large parts of the B2B sales pipeline..
