### Deep Learning Projects (DLP)
#### dlp: 
#### dlproj1: 
AlexaTM 20B – Alexa Teacher Model, a 20B-parameter multilingual seq2seq model that achieved state-of-the-art 1-shot summarization and translation, even outperforming much larger models like PaLM-540B ￼
#### dlproj2: 
CodeWhisperer – machine learning–powered coding assistant providing real-time code recommendations in IDEs, translating natural language prompts into code blocks in multiple languages ￼
#### dlproj3: 
Deep Graph Library (DGL) – open-source Python library (led by AWS and academia) that helps researchers quickly build, train, and evaluate Graph Neural Networks on large graph datasets ￼
#### dlproj4: 
AutoGluon – open-source AutoML library that “democratizes” deep learning by letting developers train high-accuracy models for vision, text, or tabular data with just a few lines of code ￼
#### dlproj5: 
AWS DeepRacer – (educational project) 1/18th-scale autonomous racing car and global league that applies deep reinforcement learning to learn to drive through trial and error on a physical track (engaging developers in applied DL)【n/a】
#### dlproj6: 
Amazon CodeGuru – AI code review and profiling service using ML to automatically flag bugs and inefficiencies in codebases, learned from vast repositories (applying deep learning to software quality)【n/a】
#### dlproj7: 
Amazon Polly – cloud service using advanced neural TTS models to convert text to natural-sounding speech in many languages, leveraging deep learning for high-quality voice synthesis【n/a】
