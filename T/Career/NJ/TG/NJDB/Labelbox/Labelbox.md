AI Assist Labeling – Labelbox’s platform features AI Assist, which integrates ML models into the labeling interface to automate repetitive tasks. For instance, AI Assist can pre-draw bounding boxes or segmentations and suggest labels based on computer vision models, greatly accelerating image/video annotation while a human reviewer corrects as needed ￼.
#### dlproj2: 
RLHF & Preference Data – Labelbox supports reinforcement learning from human feedback for generative AI. Using Labelbox, organizations can have human labelers rank AI outputs or edit responses, producing high-quality datasets for training alignment (preference) models. This approach has been used to fine-tune LLMs with human preferences (e.g. in instruction-following or multimodal chatbots) ￼ ￼.
#### dlproj3: 
Synthetic & Customized Data – To help train and evaluate generative models, Labelbox enables creation of tailored datasets. Its tooling and services can generate synthetic variations of data (images or text) and curate difficult edge cases. For example, Labelbox can synthesize domain-specific images or augment existing ones, providing additional training data for model fine-tuning when real data is limited ￼.
