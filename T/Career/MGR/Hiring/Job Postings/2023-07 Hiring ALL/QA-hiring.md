== WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR US ==

FOR NEW FEATURES
- Take a moment and try to reproduce bug this bug

- What are the types of bugs found in production
- Have QA involved thru all the process
	- create test cases at the beginning of the sprint 
	- then see if the functionality was not defined

- One-by-one meeting with Devs to validate that these cases
- Avoid future bugs - helps the devs understand problem & or the QA would do unnecessary testing

Other strategies - have QA help devs create good unit tests
Early demos from devs to products

HOW DO YOU DO YOUR EXPLORATORY TESTING?
- Critical flows



== AUTOMATED TESTING ==

BELATRIX

- 3 years. 20% time scripting.
- in a team: did the manual, decide which for automation


== BUG REPLICATION == 

BELATRIX - 15 years ago
- Pairing with the DEV so they can do the exact same steps.  "share me your code". "show me your unit test". 
- Use bug snack, use sentry to understand what is happening the backend.  then tell the Dev more about how the bug is happening.

- Work in the triage team, talking as if customer support.
- First understand if this is even a bug.


== EXPLORATORY TESTING == 

EVENT BRIGHT - didn't have a stable version to test.
- lots of issues with app versioning
- lots of issues with concurrency issues

	- used Jmeter - script to simulate user accessing.   after 1000 users app 
	- with help from 5 working for her


== HIRING QA ==

- "A good QA has very organized thinking, I check for that."
- "Put a webpage up and have them find the bugs."
- "The best organize what are the most part of organizing "
- "show me how many use cases they can find for testing the login flow for this website. "
- "how you could explode this login"
- "ask what tooling they know, but in general the can learn"
- "check out good their communication / negotiation is."   "How do you communicate/negotiate w/ dev to help the reproduce"
