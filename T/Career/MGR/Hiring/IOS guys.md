### CREATE THRIVE


### IOS GUYS FROM NICK

-   [Cezary Kopacz](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/cezary-kopacz-61009971) was a goto guy I liked to use, but it looks from LinkedIn that he's employed full time now
-   [Paulo Cheque](https://br.linkedin.com/in/paulocheque) is one of our AF guys who was affected by the layoffs at RZ. He's a full-stack, not iOS specialist, but iOS is in his wheelhouse. I know he decided to travel before looking for another gig after getting laid off. I'm not sure where he is in that process, but he may still e available
