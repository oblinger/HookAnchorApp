Goal here is to deliver a high commercial-quality end to end solution.

- The focus of this first deliverable would be the refactoring of the back end system, and use that to drive robustness of the whole sustem.
- Key: completely refactor the back end logic in order to:
	- unify all MCU level communications
	- unify all system state
	- segregate MCU comms into new gateway component
	- into whole that has unit, functional, and integration tests
- Currently believe we do not need to touch
	- front end react, or the MCU firmware code



### --- Negotiating a Contract ---

- I've been moving us away from hourly to half-day rate & managed to get all the new non-SP projects in this structure. Here is the pitch in bullets:
- $5k per developer week
	- Prorated per half day (eg: if a work day is lost to holiday / time off, or you don't get a full day's work from us)
	- We also provide additional fractional QA + technical PM, managed at Analytics Fire discussion, at no cost to you, in order to optimize execution

When you do the pitch:
- Make sure to start by affirming to them what they want
- Be plainspoken; Use their concepts/vocabulary; be extremely reluctant to introduce new concepts or vocabulary of our own
- Call out any key assumptions, especially ones that are depended on for things to go smoothly
- Paint a vivid picture of the future, from their POV
- Then communicate the rough work size in terms of time + people weeks/months
- Give it as a min/max range, with the engineering estimate as the high-end of the range
- If it's way off, stop here & don't go to [3]
- Give total cost as a range, with the cost from engineering estimate as the high end of the range
- Don't let this take up much of the air time
- If it's natural, don't even bring up the rate card. Punt until the proposal if you can. But if you can't punt, just explain to them the rate card in as straightforward way as possible
- Ask for permission to make a detailed proposal for them to review
- We usually set expectation of having draft for them to review by next week
- End the call with affirmation of the priorities/outcomes that are important to them &  review of action items.
