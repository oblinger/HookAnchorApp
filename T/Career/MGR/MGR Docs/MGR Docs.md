* TEAM PEP TALK

TRICKLE DOWN
-- Company culture begins at the very top, and like honey or shit flows downward.  
-- Stunning to me how different the character of different orgs are and it flows from the very top.
-- Bad news if your org's culture is Foobar...  honestly it is time to move on, cause you cannot fix from the middle.
-- The strongest orgs have a clear character that defines them.
-- So just know, that I know this, and I am trying really hard, and with sincerity to not fuck this up!



CAVEATES
-- HEALTHY HUMANS -- If we are healthy humans, then the most important parts of our lives
   are outside of out work.  (and I am a big fan of healthy humans.)
-- NOT WORKIN DOGS -- Working like a dog is not sustainable, it does not yield quality work,
   it is not motivating, and in the limit does not even speed up progress.  
   So I am NOT a fan of 70 hour work weeks, nor extreme pressure work environements.
-- I say these things up front becuase the rest of this talk might 
   convince you that you are working for high pressure maniac.


   

NOT A JUST A JOB -- this is my life's work.
--  Not my only life's work, or highest life work.  But a very very important life work.
--  The hours of my life are too valuable to expend them on anything less.
--  Building this platform for robotic action in unstructured environments
    is a great great challenge -- and certainly worthy of my time.
--  I think this challenge is greater and more interesting than almost 
    any other job I could be doing right now.
--  I hope you see this job in the same way.  It is important that you do.
--  Maybe today this is all too new for you to feel that way, but it is improtant that this changes
--  There is no room in this organization for people that are just checking the box.
    aiming to do the minimum effort to keep getting a pay check.



REALLY WANT IT -- 
--  I really really care that we succeed, and you must too.
--  Suppose in two more houra you could complete an important PR today, which would clear the deck 
    for others to continue work later tonight.  And you care enough about team velocity that you WANT to do it, so you do.
--  Suppose you are helping someone who was struggling.  You check in after dinner
    to see if they doing ok now?  Are they wasting a whole day on a struggle you could easily fix?  You check because you care
--  In short, I give much more than the minimum require of me for this job.
    I do it without  even thinking about it, or counting the minutes.  
    I do it because I care about success that much, and because I LIKE it.
--  See if you find value it what is being done here, value in the growing that you can do here, 
    the fun you can have here, and see if that can become the primary driver for your action.
--  Work is not "work" and comes easy when you REALLY want it!


BUT IT IS ABOUT OUTCOMES NOT HOURS
 


TEAM PLAY 


GREAT AT SOMETHING
--  But it is CRITICAL to be GREAT at something.  A great team require 
    great action and you need to be great in order to contribute.
--  And good enough at most things that you are not a liability in the team.
--  But as a member of a large team is a quite safe to be really shitty at a few things too.
    No shame and no problem, as long as someone else can help support you in the part we are fine.
--  Indeed I view it as my responsiblity to each of you to provide you the context to grow in the 
    ways you want to grow.  You will love this place and be loyal to it, if we are loyal to you.


PRESSURE
--  I believe the best work is done under pressure -- modest pressure.
    pressure to complete within a defined period of time.
    pressure to move faster.
    pressure to produce higher quality.
    pressure to do all of those as the same time!
    but MODEST pressure, and pressure applied with great sensitivity to


PADDING
--  Engineers often pad.  Not (usually) because they want to keep things easy.
    but because they know there are many uncertainties, and they don't 
    want to make promises they fail to deliver.

--  Don't do this.  Lets pick our estimates in ways that yield some 
    pressure to complete.  We will do our best work.

--  Of course this will result i ntmisses.  Without padding
    when something unexpected goes really wrong, we miss our (internal) 
    target.  This is expected, if it does not happen, we are not really leaning in.
    
--  We are ALL engineers here, and understand that unexpected events will blow the delivery.
    That is ok.  It is a sign that we are really leaning in.

--  But when failure occurs there really should be something unexpected happening.
    -- Needed to spend 2 hours helping someone does not count.  Each week we allocate notable
       hours for planning, meetings, and helping.
    -- Hitting smaller issues also doesn't count.  
       Under modest pressure we should be operating with the assumption that we MUST succeed.  
       Dont let your self off the hook easily (I wont either).  
       Get it DONE, make it WORK.  Solve the problem!  Operate as if you have NO other choice.
       For an "A" player it feels good to push to the edge.  to not be sure -- then to make it.

--  And when you don't make it, it will be ok.  We know we are running w/o padding, so it will happen.
    -- But willing engage in the "mind fuck"  operate as if you MUST succeed.  
       A little past the point of hopelessness, then we will all re-frame to again be winnable.



MEASURING IT
--  Measure everything, but focus on what matters
--  time measuring.
--  outcomes
--  collaborations.
--  initiative
--  effectiveness as measured purely by outcomes.
