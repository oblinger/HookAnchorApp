- FRAME - Frame full product as a sequence of progressively more challenging products.  
  Where all products in the sequence provide at least a bit of customer value.
  Each product will progress thru the remaining steps below, though later stages can overlap next product's early stages.
- SPECIFY - Written spec of the CORE AI capability sought, the evaluation metric, and the success criteria
- GATHER - Get the data, ground truth, and metrics required for experimentation
- ITERATE - Run as many well considered experiments per week as possible to achieve the success criteria
- VALIDATE - Validate success criteria has been met on a large enough hold out set to have some confidence in result
- POC - Build shaky end-to-end POC and provide results back to users for validation.
  .		Run system on 10x more data looking for edge cases
- PROD - Clean up POC so it can run smoothly enough to support alpha customers.
  .		Run system on 10x more data validating viability of product
- SCALE - Focus on compute and other bottlenecks the limit product scaling.
  .		Run system on 10x more data validating scalability of product.
