#### REACTIVE - Work easiest when task triggers are presented from the outside.

#### COMMITMENT AVERSE - I systematically dodge certain commitment steps

#### WORKY - I am always "working." its my mental mode

#### LIMIT - No heads down grind
- Seem to have daily limit (3h??), not effective after (for work I don't love)
  (My limit is notably higher for tasks 'coming at me')
