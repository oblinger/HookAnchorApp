	home boy is a braggin.
	

	




	I am doing an extended bio for NKU   (No knowlege U).  my undergrad alma matter. 

	The kentucky boy makes good story will be bolstered by facts regarding the WMR program. 


	How many class rooms, schools, disctricts, and states, were involved in the project?/How many are still involved? /What is the reach of the ESL arm of the project?   number of programs etc. 

	9 states. 
	 Development --- mostly testing and language model data collection -- took place in New   York, Philadelphia, Texas, Kentucky --- I'm not making that up either ---, Utah, Oregon, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Georgia.  It is still being used in the two school districts where it was piloted, Philadelphia and Houston. In Houston it sees daily use in around 100 schools where it has become a fixture in the bilingual education program.  There has been at least one UT-Austin masters thesis on its efficacy in helping ESL kids learn to read in English.  

	It was evaluated by Prof. Susan Williams, then of Vanderbilt, now of UT-Austin,  who found that for measures of a) immediate word recognition skill gain, b) engagement, and c) comprehension it worked significantly better than simply reading a book. She measured dozens of first graders at the beginning of school and the end with half using the standard book treatment and half using WMR.  (Members who used WMR in the fall tested with a book in the spring and vice versa).  One of the most powerful partsof the environment involves the rich information set provided to the teachers. Moreover, because the cost of collecting that detailed level of information is so low, more teachers get engaged at a level that they usually cannot afford.  The reports also link instruction in the classroom with parents who can help with practice at home because they can be given information about exactly what to practice.  By the way, all the reporting stuff was created by the incomparably brilliant Dr. Daniel Oblinger.

	It was the first speech enabled reading tutor to create and use a speech model made specifically for primary grade children. 

	Here's a write-up someone created:

	Watch Me! Read software uses speech recognition technology to help an emerging reader
	(ages 4-8) read an on-screen book and create a multimedia performance of the book
	featuring the child's voice and video commentary. Although the recognition accuracy of
	this technology in actual classrooms is still being evaluated, it offers great promise for
	providing frequent formative assessments of children's reading.

	Speech recognition for adults has been widely available for some time, but similar,
	commercially available systems based on children's voices and vocabulary did not exist.
	This was due, in part, to the lack of appropriate acoustic models for children's voices.
	Recently, researchers at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center have developed the
	necessary models based on speech samples collected from over 1800 linguistically
	diverse children at 20 sites across the U.S. Despite this breakthrough, there are still
	numerous challenges for software developers using speech recognition for reading
	instruction. These challenges include: -- creation of an interface simple enough to be
	navigated by a young children without diminishing the experience of reading -- design of
	technology that tracks a child's progress through the text despite numerous pauses,
	omissions, repetitions, insertions, and mispronunciations -- improved recognition of
	alternate forms of pronunciation common in regional dialects and of children's speech at
	varying stages of maturation -- creation of appropriate feedback for situations in which
	the system can't be certain of the correctness of the child's performance.

	Watch Me! Read is designed to overcome these problems in order to provide independent
	oral reading practice opportunities for young children. Development and refinement of
	the system has been guided by testing in several public school classrooms. These pilots
	have resulted in improved recognition of commonly mistaken words and the creation of a
	diagnostic tool that provides formative assessments of individual student's reading
	performance. Members of Vanderbilt's Learning Technology are currently collaborating
	with IBM's Watson Research Center to evaluate a system-wide implementation of Watch
	Me! Read in the Houston public school system.

#### ACCOMPLISHMENTS

	TRACER

	•	Developed the semantics, designed and implemented a data-directed control flow mechanism as a research associate at OSU.  The mechanism drives part of the AI toolset upon which many AI applications have been written.

	•	Designed and implemented a frame based object oriented language for home automation.  HAL (Home Automation Language) uses a message sending mechanism which is a generalization of Smalltalk's message send.  All knowledge in the system is embedded in a virtual frame database derived from Minsky's frames.  The constructs of the language are defined using a restricted form of attribute grammars (for efficiency).  Even these attribute grammars are contained within the database to allow easy extension/modification of the language.  I have been designing/redesigning this language for over 4 years.  On top of this language I have built programs which utilize a speech synthesizer, A to D converter, touch-tone phone decoder, and many TTL \& relay lines.  All of which I have built and added to my PC-AT.

	•	Designed and implemented task synchronization primitives as a software engineer for IBM.  Primitives are to be used for more than five languages on the IBM 370.

	•	Composed a document to be used as part of a users manual for the above synchronization primitives.  Also wrote a second document which contains an informal proof that the primitives perform according to specification in a multitasking/multiprocessor environment. 

	•	Drafted proposal for, designed, implemented, and tested a text processing environment for the handicapped which is still in use.  Environment included an extensive programmable full screen editor, a note-indexing facility, and an automatic dictionary which interactively completes word being typed.  System is designed to minimize keystrokes.

	•	Implemented XINU, a multi-tasking networking operating system written on a bare IBM-PC.

	•	Designed and implemented a dialect of {\em LISP} in 6809 assembler.  The interpreter uses a shallow binding scheme and has fifty-five primitives most of which are list manipulation or control flow primitives including:  CATCH/THROW/ UNWIND-PROTECT, error trapping, and a non-local GO that can change the context in effect.

	•	Implemented a recursive-descent compiler for a statically-scoped language similar to PASCAL.

	•	Research Paper (unpub) ``Knowledge Representations Used In Learning.''

	Worked with faculty to expand undergraduate Computer Science curriculum to include a class on Automata Theory and Formal Languages.
#### AWARDS AND ACTIVITIES
	•	Graduated Suma Cum Laude.
	•	Outstanding Student of the Year Award in both Mathematics and Computer Science.

	   mechanisms especially suited for certain reasoning tasks which are
	   typically encountered during the course of diagnosis, design, planning
	   and similar knowledge-based activities.  By directly supporting a set
	   of basic reasoning tasks, the toolset provides building blocks out of
	   which more complex reasoning systems can be built." }

	Daniel Oblinger and Gerald DeJong, Dynamic-bias Induction 

	A tradeoff exists between the range of learning tasks solved by an induction system, and its performance
	on those tasks. We propose dynamic-bias induction, an approach in which bias is dynamically constructed
	as a function of the learning task. This admits the possibility of a high performance inductive learner that
	applies to a wide range of learning tasks. We assess the benefits and limitations of dynamic-bias induction
	by comparing an implementation of the approach to two existing inductive learning systems. 


	Current explanation-based learning systems acquire plans using a model of the world that is assumed to
	be perfect. Such systems perform well in executing these acquired plans in their perfect simulated world,
	but encounter difficulties in the real world. This is because current systems implicitly assume their model to
	be correct when it is actually impossible to model the real world perfectly. Our approach, embodied in the
	GRASPER system, is to make explicit approximations that the system can refine when failures are
	encountered. GRASPER makes use of its explicit approximation capability to represent uncertainties about
	objects in the world. This enables it to acquire plans capable of functioning in spite of uncertainties.
