## PYRAMID

A proven AI PhD/CTO: with decade+ hands on experience in ML/DL, built 5 orgs from scratch (up to 60 engineers), funded hundreds of millions in research at DARPA, exited three companies, and brought products to market worth billions.  Looking for a hands-on role leading generative-AI based innovation.

My sweet-spot is bridging world-leading R&D into rapid productization.


(Master Versions in [[RES Parts]])

- PhD in AI/ML from a top engineering school: Illinois (UIUC)
- CTO for 5 companies: with 3 exits, and 2 continuing
- Dozens of peer reviewed conference and journal publications.
- 20+ Patents Granted.

### Decade+ Experience in AI/ML/DL/CV/Robotics
- SportsVisio - In-the-code leading of advanced CV team
- Martian/Aeolus Robotics - Hired 40+ AI-PhDs, chief architect for solution, managed 60+ eng team
- DARPA PM for $200+M in AI R&D projects.  Designed 

### Built Multiple Engineering Orgs From Scratch
- Aeolus: 60+ Eng (40+ with PhDs)
- AF: ~50 person team with 30+ eng
- DARPA: 5 orgs spanning 500+ faculty and researchers.   ??? numbers
- Martian Robots 13 person team

### Funded/Lead Hundreds of Millions in Research
- Funded over $200 in AI Research as a PM at DARPA
- Created and lead Machine Reading and Bootstrapped Learning programs.
- Lead the Transfer Learning program

### Exited Three Companies
- Analytics Fire -> Rzero
- Martian Robots -> Aeolus
- PayByGroup -> FEVO

### Brought Multiple Products To Market Totaling More Than $3B In Value
- Soup-to-nuts our team developed the SW and Firmware for Envoy, Oasis, and TMAC.  Together these represent more than $3B in hardware.

- Productizing

### ROLE - LEADER / HANDS-ON
- Technical Manager / Tech Lead / Director of technical project

### ORG
1. Advanced Big Co
2. Well Funded Startup



### SOFT ATTRIBUTES

TECHNICAL
- Technically Deep - 
- Proven tech leader - 
- Bridge AI research into commercial success
- Bridge AI Research into Viable Prototypes
- Rapid Prototyping - 


LEADER


SOFT-SKILLS
- INNOVATIVE
- PRAGMATIC
- HIGH TEMPO



## ATTRIBUTES OF MOST DESIRABLE JOBS

### HIGH RATIO OF TECHNICAL WORK
- HARD TECH - Discussing/Thinking/Leading/Doing:   deep technical work
ACTIVITES
- DELIVERING SYSTEMS - Focused on a technically challenging working system
- DESIGNING - APIs, Architectures, Product Features
- TECH ADVISE - Technical advising

### ROLE / PROJECT / COMPANY
- ROLE: TECH LEAD 				- My ideal role is tech lead, where a significant fraction of my time is discussing / solving technical challenges
- ROLE: ENG MGR				- Could be an Eng Mgr that is still very technical.  (e. g. active in designing solution)
- ROLE: CTO, etc.				- Really could be any role that was the leader of some advanced AI product(s).
- PROJ: NOVEL APPLICATION	- Ideally this is focused on iterative refinement of recent research into working product prototypes
- PROJ: APPLYING GEN-AI 		- 
- PROJ: COMPUTER VISION		- 
- CORP: FOUNDATIONAL			- Org is building their own foundational models; FAANG-ish

### INNOVATIVE
- Love it when NO ONE knows how to attack the problem at hand
- Love it when one needs to quickly triage many different aspects of a problem

### CLEAN
- Carefully designed 'things'



# LOG

### 2025-01-13  Notes From Nick -- Dan's approach frame self:   to weave

STORY:  Great explanation of why I want to jump into more hands on role in an area that I don't have experience.


- train a foundational model; 


Smooth talking alpha exec 
- very self centered; very much a hero talking to another hero in our circle.


With new waves of technology I flip back into IC roles and transition them into leadership on this.

- in order stay on the bleeding edge I bounce from IC-tech-lead to Executive on successive AI tech waves.
	- Statistical ML -> IoT -> Robotics -> Gen AI


### 2024-09-19  Objective

Objective: 
Technically lead prototyping/productization of advanced AI, ideally leveraging my experience with generative models.
