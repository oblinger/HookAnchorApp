I'm also a big fan of having directionally consistent indentation. I just made that phrase up but basically, I wouldn't have bullets indented and then unindented outcomes. I think the simplest way to do this in your case is to shift the "Career at a glance" bullets to the left to be flush with the left margin, and to change the "Action" lines to be indentationally consistent (I'm on a roll) with the "Outcome" lines.  
  
I'm happy to discuss late this afternoon or over the weekend.(Edited)


QUESTIONS:
- Education: I had a 3.92 and 4.0/4.0 GPA for undergrad and grads.  
  Should I list those or just say "Summa cum laude"
