## SPORTS VISIO

Hired to fix quality, velocity, delivery, and personnel issues across Software and AI teams.
- Replaced the entire AI team; Hired a new QA team
- Developed and implemented formalization SW life cycle
- Worked to strategically reduce product scope to match dev resources while still delivering features required to drive sales.
==> Went from an "unshipable" product to deployments that routinely had zero high severity bugs.
==> Raised $5M+ from Tier-1 VCs including Sapphire Ventures
==> Grew sales from thousands to hundreds of thousands 

### __
#### ...
As a result we: raised over $4M in new funding, Grew sales from thousands to hundreds of thousands, formalized bi-monthly shipping of four products typically with zero high priority bugs in production across all
==> Transitioned to bi-monthly shipping of 4 products with >10x reduction in serious bugs

==> Raised $3M seed from Sapphire Ventures
==> Grew sales from x to y ARR
==> Transitioned to bi-monthly shipping of 4 products with >10x reduction in serious bugs

SPORTS VISIO Turn Around
- S: $3M and 2years spent.  never shipped, never met deadline within factor of 2.
- T: Right the ship, improve quality & velocity.
- A: Layoffs, Descoping, Hires, Revamped all processes
- R: Shipped.  Stable.  Bugs dropped immeasurably > ?3? quarterly.  

#### SITUATION - Late joining "founder" (>2 years) w/ lg equity & turn round mandate
- Burnt $3M - no AI product, SW product was an unusable brick. 
- Great CEO vision and investor relations but dumpster Fires EVERYWHERE in SW team.

#### TASK: Fix Org and Personnel.  ACTIONS: ReOrg. Layoffs/Hiring. HireFlow
- **Re-Org** --> Initially SW and CV leads still reported to CEO.  -->  whole SW org report to me.
- **Two Level Mgt** & **Split VP Eng** into (Dir Eng, PM, AI head)
- Many **layoffs**.  Hired QA team; 
- **Hiring pipe** "interviewed" recruiting firms & hired 2.  built key paid tests & tracking/triage flows.
#### TASK: Ship Product.  ACTIONS: Descope. Freeze/Test. Plan. Track.
- SCOPE: **Excessive Scope** --> 2apps.   (started as 8 separate interfaces being worked on by 4 full time devs and 4 part time devs.)
- FREEZE: **App Stability** Issues --> Feature freeze + Fellowship of the bug + External Testing team to drive bug capture & fixing to 100%
- PLAN:
	- **Low level tracking** in a spreadsheet  --> Jira tracking & sprint planning
	- **Mid-level planning** --> Fully ordered backlog of features complete at two sprints out.
	- No written **High level targets** --> Top roadmap, A-round targets, OKR methodology
	- **OKRs** --> Instituted pervasive use of **OKRs** per department. (with head of sales)
	- **CEO Vision** --> One Page Vision & A-round Deliverables.
- EXECUTE:
	- **Bug tracking** in slack --> Jira + Bug board.   (Fellow ship of the bug)
	- **Poor testing** --> Added field testing + regression testing + fellowship of the bug + Weekly tracking of six KPIs
	- No **Regression testing** --> Tests on major apps; Diversity tests; 
	- Added **Test Automation** --> Circle CI; Unit testing frameworks; key functional tests & slowly started adding coverage
- FORMALIZE:
	- Unified company roadmap
	- Quarterly OKRs, tracked monthly
	- Ad hoc **Dev Ops** --> Push2Prod flow + Cloud Formation

##### detailed actions

- STRATEGIC
	- **Key Strategic "Ingest" Gap** --> Owned solution analysis matrix & tasked ICs under my leads.
	- Multi-sport shift
- CV TEAM
	- **Missed every deliverable** date and every metric target ever set.
	- **Replaced 100% of CV team**:  Vishal, Chris, Sarthi, Michael, (Fong)  with  Greg-Martin-Maxim-Juan-James.
	- Built ML infrastructure -- ML-flow,
	- Created all execution processes:  Jira, CI-testing, Regression, Collaborative API planning 
	- Systematic 

###### No Jira (Low Planning)
Teams had not been doing any ticket tracking and were using spreadsheets
- They had just hired an junior PM as I joined.
- We had her start attending sprint planning meetings, initially she just documented activity using JIRA
- Over time she started prompting for Jira tickets during "planning". but planning was way too in the weeds.
- --> Instituted 1-page sprint over view broken out by person.  This greatly helped one-sprint at a time planning abstraction.


## ANALYTICS FIRE
Founded and grew 50+ person clean energy company.  Our 140+ projects included:
==> Developed, shipped, and managed firmware through cloud infrastructure controlling over $3B in various clean energy assets.  Projects include:

- A computer-vision-based solar-roof-installation design tool for our fortune 1000 customer.
  ==> Became their “largest single driver of new revenue growth” as they transitioned to residential solar.

- Over 3 years and 22 FTE we built majority of Sunpower's tools managing entire residential solar life product lifecycle.
  ==> Transitioned from XXXX in residential solar in 20xx up to YYYY in 20yy, ultimately enabling a complete commercial divestiture and transition in 20ZZ.

### __
#### Instant Design
- S: Fortune 1000 client tasked us to build a computer-vision-based solar roof installation designer tool.  Customer gave us limited rope after internal team failed at this. 
- T:	Initial task was to demonstrate "instant design" was possible
- A: Light 1-month R&D cycle + 2-month dirty prototyping
  Won long term contract, built and operated capability until we sold the company
- R: Our solution became “the largest single driver of new revenue growth” according to our client — enabling them to penetrate and scale in a new high-margin market segment.

#### Sunpower Residential Solar
- S: Sunpower desired a strategic shift from commercial to residential solar
- T: Build suite of infrastructure required for penetration into the consumer solar market.
- A: Over 3 years, and 22 FTE we build majority of their suite of tools managing entire residential solar life cycle, including:
- R: Sunpower transitioned from XXXX residential in 20XX upto YYYY in 20YY, and ultimately divested commercial solar in ZZZZ.
