	abstract = {Abstract. We present a novel approach to learning predictive sequential models, called similarity-based alignment and generalization, which incorporates in the induction process a specific form of domain knowledge derived from a similarity metric of the points in the input space. When applied to Hidden Markov Models, our framework yields a new class of learning algorithms called SimAlignGen. We discuss the application of our approach to the problem of programming by demonstration–the problem of learning a procedural model of a user’s behavior by observing the interaction an application GUI. We describe in detail the SimIOHMM, a specific instance of SimAlignGen that extends the known Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM). We use the SimIOHMM in empirical evaluations that demonstrates the dependence of the prediction accuracy on the introduced similarity bias, as well as the computational gains over the IOHMM. 1},

### JOE AUGENBRAUN
  
Dan was one of my co-founders at Martian Robots.  I worked closely with Dan in the intense, exhilarating, dynamic, and often frustrating world of doing a startup together.  Dan was CTO and I was CEO.  
  
Let me start with Dan’s technical capabilities – they're top-notch.  He’s smart, clever (those are different things), knowledgeable, and detail-oriented while being able to keep the big picture in mind at all times.  He has an impressive combination of hands-on and theoretical knowledge across a wide range of AI and robotics topics.  His ability to understand deep academic papers in almost any engineering field and apply the learning to practical problems is the sort of secret weapon that every company wants but few have.  
  
He rolled up his sleeves and did work personally to help construct our robot prototype needed for fundraising and then built and ran a high-performance engineering team that spanned the globe.  He has a methodology and a machine for hiring top-notch people and has the personal skills to build them into an organization that delivers.  His enthusiasm and drive created a culture of fast pace, individual autonomy, and deep respect for every individual in his team and in the organization.  
  
Dan isn’t just good at technology.  As CTO he helped figure out the business with me.  He has a good business sense and is an excellent communicator and was great with investors.  
  
I loved working with Dan and would work with him again in a heartbeat.  He has the highest integrity and even when times were tough (they always are at some point in a startup) he was loyal and constructive.  We formed a great friendship and in our business a great partnership.
