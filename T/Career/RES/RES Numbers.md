Larger exploratory DARPA efforts (1⁄2 to 5 million dollars)
1. **Attacking Time** – Pervasive, OS-level variability, inoculates systems against any fixed virus/worm.   (I am assuming ML-like adaptation, not sure that is right)
2. **Möbius** – Self-organizing ontology acquisition system.
3. **ML on Multi-core Architectures** – Develop primitives supporting algorithms in a shared-memory context.
4. **Never Ending Learning** – Statistical “triangulation” to uncover latent world knowledge underling web data.
5. **Enhanced Bootstrapping** – Precursor to BL program, developed self-extensible representations of procedural & declarative knowledge.
6. **Textual Corpora Assessments Protocols** – Intellectual cross fertilization in field of text processing gated by availability of strong, quantitative, comparative measures.
7. **Transfer Learning for Adaptive Information Extraction** – Series of efforts to transition base TL technology to self-adapting info extractors spanning, language task and genre.
8. XXX Game World – US lags developed world in science education. Studies show computer games retain attention, but don’t teach. Effort enables game/scenario writers to compete on game’s teaching performance.
9. **Latent Information in Folksonomies** – Extracting latent structure in user content tags. (e.g. flickr / delicious)
10. **Universal Self-Supervised Hierarchical Learning** – Adaptive algorithms driven by spectrum of novel feedback signals (e.g. curiosity, drive to control, drive to mimic, etc.)

A: Over the course of three years, we built and refined the computational infrastructure driving their rapid penetration into the consumer solar market.  This included:
- Workflows - Customized to scale all aspects of this new market:
     Quote generation & sales * Ordering + approval process * Order & shipment tracking * Installer workflow & portal 
- Analytics – To monitoring and optimize costs and time 
- Infrastructure – 
- Performance Modeling & performance monitoring

Design optimization stuff
Installer stuff
Performance monitoring stuff

#### $3B+ in IoT assets controlled by AF SW. (See numbers above)
- TMAC Project - 
- Oasis Project - 

**DETAILS ON NUMBER OF IOT DEVICES**
- **we wrote code for multiple 100K hub devices that are controlling millions of individual panel sensor devices**
- **TMAC** - power plant controllers.   100K+ controllers  (We did not build from scratch.)
- [Gala oregon plant](https://newsroom.sunpower.com/2017-02-27-SunPower-Starts-Construction-On-56-Megawatt-Gala-Solar-Power-Plant-in-Oregon) Big plant $300M Gala Oregon plant.
- Solar star. largest solar in world until 2016. 1.7M panels
- **OASIS** - powerplant controllers.
   (upto 70 trackers per hub, many solar panels))
- **PVS5** - residential hub  100s K connected to handful of devices.
- **Envoy** - residential hub.  handful of devices per envoy. (Enphase)
- 1M+ clean energy devices.  (these are individual sensors or panels)


#### OTHER AF NOTES

- Founded and grew a 50+ engineer & scientist team of AI and IoT specialists focused on clean energy.
- Deployed solutions that analyze and control hundreds of thousands of fielded devices collectively worth over three billion dollars.
- Developed green-field prototypes like Sunpower's Instant Design which combine latest resarch in geometric-constraint processing, machine vision, deep learning, and GPU optomization; then translated the prototype a production system rolled out nationwide.  It is now a new key sales direct to consumer inbound sales channel for the consumer solar market.

##### . notes

- Lead the development of the software for the Aeolus Eldercare Assistance Robot, and delivered this widely noted prototype for presentation at CES.  (Prototype is also the basis for an ongoing relationship with a largest keretsu in Japan, where it is in service in their elder care facilities.)
- Created and lead the hiring team which in turn hired 60 engineers out of over 15,000 applicants (most within a 9 month window).  We hired over 40 with PhDs, many in very targeted sub-disciplines: robotics (grasping, haptic control, etc.), vision (skeletal tracking, high frame rate feature tracking, etc), machine learning (deep learning).
- Established an Aeolus research group within a world-leading grasping research center in Vienna.
- Helped secure $10M in funding from Jafco among other leading investors.

#### Funded Work
•	Just under quarter billion, created, sold, and executed
−	Won and defended just under a quarter of a billion dollars in program funding
−	100% success in obtaining authorization for new, and 100% success in defense of existing efforts.  Notable given that the success rate in creating new programs, and defense of their budget over their lifetime both are about 50-50, and this 100% success is over a dozen Director office presentations
•	Larger initiaves (> 50 million) entirely managed by self  (created, sold, and executed)
•	Smaller or inherited efforts:
−	Transfer Learning
−	Information Extraction  (Singapore)
−	Universal Self supervised induction
−	AI & multicore
−	Game world
−	Folksonomy
−	BL seedling?
−	MR seedling name?
−	Mobius name? 
•	Won funding (AR)
•	DARPA Tech IPTO booth

#### Number of dollars and people managed
MR: $25M/yr for 5 years.	3 teams.  $8M/prime.  13 profs per prime
BL: $15M/yr for 3 years.	2 teams + BlueTeam 
TL:	$18M/yr for 3 years.	3 teams.  ($6M per team is a guess, remember it)


BL
$4m internal.  $300K/person = 12heads
$4m / 12profs per prime = $300K per prof.
      4 people = 10% one prof.  1-postdoc.  2-grads
      

~
MR Prime = 12 + 48 = 60people x 3 primes = 180heads for MR
BL Prime = 50heads (little smaller). 20 on Blue = 120heads for BL
I was managing ~300 heads when both BL and MR were executing.
~
120heads for TL since it was similar in size to BL
