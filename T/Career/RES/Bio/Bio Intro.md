Yaroslav,

Michael told me about you, and it seemed there were a couple of areas where you could give advice, and where we could have productive conversation.

A bit of background on me:

— I have a PhD in ML from U Illinois, worked at IBM Watson Research, was a DARPA PM and managed over $200M in AI R&D.

— I am interested in GAI… specifically an approach that leverages social learning with deep nets.  And an interest in the topic of GAI safety too.

— As I understand it, you are operating part of your time as an AI consultant.  I am very interested to get tips on how such a thing works (or doesn’t work) for you.

  

Really looking forward to chatting about all of these topics.
