I have known Jason as both close friend and colleague for over 15 years and have always appreciated his leadership style and ability to execute.  Over the years since DARPA we have been actively looking for a way to join forces, indeed I was one of the first people Jason called when he had his vision for an AI-driven Basketball stats.  SportsVisio.

Over the last 2 years I have enjoyed being a sounding board for many technical aspects of Sportsvisio's execution, and now that I have sold my previous company, I am in a great position to (finally) join forces with Jason as the CTO for SportsVisio.  Independent of my connection to Jason, I have been watching the Cambrian explosion of startups building on recent advances in deep learning with an eye towards founding or joining one.  Many transformative new companies will be born during this period---I am thrilled to be part of this revolution!

QUICK BIO:  
Dan began his research career with a PhD in Machine Learning from U Illinois Urbana-Champaign then working at IBM Research and teaching at Columbia University he authored many first tier publications and almost 30 patents. Building from his individual contributor work he joined DARPA (alongside Jason) and funded over $200M in R&D focusing on Machine Learning as applied to Vision and Natural Language Processing. One of his programs, "Machine Reading," provided the basis for IBM's Watson technology used in their Jeopardy playing system.   After DARPA he moved to silicon valley where he has founded and exited three companies, including an AI-based clean tech company, and a robotics company with a general purpose in dexterous eldercare robot that required building out a 40+ person Ph.D. team spanning a dozen plus subspecialties.

STARTER BIO
In the decade and a half that I have known Jason, we have actively looked for ways to join forces, and I am excited to see that this is finally happening.  Advances in Computer Vision have spurred a Cambrian explosion of computer vision based-startup, now is the time these new companies will cement their positions in these new markets, so I was looking for an opportunity just like this to be part of that revolution.

I have a PhD in Machine Learning from UIUC and have used that background as an individual researcher at IBM's Watson Lab and Teaching at Columbia University, publishing dozens of papers and hold almost 30 patents. Expanding on my IC work, I joined DARPA (alongside Jason) and funded over $200M in R&D focusing on Machine Learning as applied to Vision and Natural Language Processing. One of my DARPA programs of note was "Machine Reading." in which IBM developed their  Watson Jeopardy playing system.   that unified knowledge across tens of thousands of books to best humanity in answering Jeopardy questions. After DARPA I moved to silicon valley where I have started and exited three companies, a specialized payments platform, a robotics company building a general purpose in home dexterous robot, and an AI-based clean tech company. In the past I have built 50+ person engineering teams, including a team of 40+ PhDs that spanned the globe.  I can't wait to dig in and make myself useful here at Sports Visio!

14.10 – Surprising Discoveries / Hacking Systems  (YC application)
In undergrad our school administration decided students should not be playing games during certain hours.  Being forbidden galvanized my resolve to break in and play during these hours.  On our first round I discovered that I could attach a debugger to the gate-keeper program and inject a second program to scan its memory to reverse engineer their hidden folder locations.  They got wiser and did not use hidden file locations.  In our second round I figured out enough of the decision logic of the gate-keeper so I could manually edit stack variables in order to trick it to let me in.  In our third round, I discovered that VT100 terminals can be assigned a 'name' and then commanded to report their name.  Using this I could write a "poisoned" email that made it seem the viewer had exited their email client and then invoked a script in my account.  (They never figured out how this one was happening, but they did find a list of usernames and passwords for thousands of users included many administrators in a folder, I had hidden in another users account...   this freaked them out enough, that it was clear, and further hacking on my part was going to really get me in trouble.)
~-~-~
Linear algebra was not known as our hardest course, but the prof was a big believer in copious homework to help “pull student grades up.”  I successfully argued that if this was truly his intent, then it should be my option to forgo that “advantage.”  He agreed, but said I could not ‘revert’ back once I had opted to discard all homework.  Predictably I did zero homework, thus I learned the theory but not the details.

His final exam was expected to take 2-3 hours, but it was untimed.  My second hack was mostly an act of tenacity, but it did salvage my GPA from the consequences of my first hack:  Early that next morning I finally turned in my answers for the exam….  Two proofs were, as expected—less than one page long.  The other two, on the other hand, were each almost ten pages – this is because they had embedded in them the re-derivation of two key “helper” lemmas that I would have known…. If only I had done the homework.

ACHIEVE:  Was (am) profoundly dyslexic… years in special Ed. classes, doctors, etc.; yet managed to get a PhD.
BUILT:  Created & Executed $150+ million DARPA effort to map natural text onto RDF ontologies.  This serves as the backbone of the IBM Jeopardy playing system called Watson.

At IBM research we built a desktop 'programming by demonstration' recorder.  it needed to guess 
why you executed on path in your keyboard/mouse recipe based on the words and icons on your screen.

somehow we were able to bias this learner to select the right reason, often when it 
only had one example of each scrpt path taken.  ML theory says this should just never work
... it is something about biasing, but to this day, I am not exactly clear why that works
as impossibly well as it does.

-----
- electronic trading strategy
- very good strategy in core-wars / and in c-robots involved doing 'physics' experiments in
  these virtual worlds.
- hacking systems w. VT100 command codes / debug mode on processes
  control-char code attacks
- E-M 
- levels of infinity.  axiom of choice is relates to whether there is an infinite between reals and rationals

### 2009.12 – Award Nomination -- DARPA PM OF THE YEAR
Name of Nominator: Mr. Daniel Kaufman
Name of Nominee: Dr. Daniel Oblinger

Criteria:
1.	Technical capability and rigor: Dr. Oblinger created the Machine Reading (MR) program, IPTO's largest AI effort and an important first step towards enabling automated translation of natural linguistic information into formally processable data and effectively handling the incompatibilities between natural language and the language of formal inference.  Dr. Oblinger structured MR to enable the use of textual knowledge in service of a variety of performance tasks.  One important decision he made was to separate the reading and reasoning mechanisms from the task knowledge to achieve generality and domain-independent capabilities for knowledge mapping between natural and formal languages in any subject domain. 
2.	Program management, leadership, and execution: In addition to MR, Dr. Oblinger manages two other DARPA programs: Transfer Learning, which has spawned a new machine learning research sub-community; and Bootstrapped Learning, which aims at agility for military hardware and software by enabling end-user adaptation.  His program execution is distinguished by innovative source selection contracting terms that have encouraged the use of open source licensing to promote national collaboration outside the bounds of the funded performers.  He has engaged personnel at DoD organizations (including JFCOM, NSA, and Creech AFB) to ensure that program deliverables are aligned with mission requirements and user needs.
3.	Team building and support of others: Dr. Oblinger has sought out the best and the brightest from across the artificial intelligence and natural language processing communities to participate in his Machine Reading program.  He has engaged NIST in the creation of open evaluations for the Machine Reading program.
4.	Clear, accurate communications with peers, performer community, management, the Services, DoD and government leadership: Dr. Oblinger has utilized a range of mechanisms to ensure clear communication and foster effective performer teams.  This includes the use of multiple RFIs and industry days for each program created, open teaming web-sites, and very detailed BAAs that provide clarity about the technical and programmatic objectives while encouraging effective team formulation.  He represents the cognitive side of IPTO as a standing member of the IPTO senior advisory group, received a speaking award at DARPA Tech 2007, and was selected to brief IPTO’s language and text capabilities to the SECDEF.
5.	Contribution to Office/Agency/DoD mission and objectives: Dr. Oblinger has served as IPTO’s AI/computer science technical leader since the IPTO-IXO merger.  His input is sought in AI/CS hiring decisions and he works with new PMs in their first months at DARPA. His Machine Reading Program will make natural-text-based information readily available for automated exploitation in C2I systems, benefitting commanders, warfighters, and analysts, and unleash a wide variety of new AI applications ranging from intelligent bots to personal tutors and assistants.

M.S. in Computer Science from Ohio State University, 1989
Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Illinois, 1998


I am a research scientist at the IBM T.J. Watson lab.  The lab is aimed at inventing the technology that will drive computing decades ahead.  It is an energetic place where ideas and prototypes rule supreme.  If you know how to do it better: tell us, and then show us.  People on my hallway include the guys that built the chess program that beat the world champion Kasparov.  Mandelbrot is on the floor right below me, as are the guys trying to build a quantum computer and Linux on a watch.  Industrial research is the place for me.  I like solving technical problems, and at the same time I want that problem solving to actually have impact on the world.  My current project (along with two other researchers) is to develop a machine learning algorithm which automatically produces a script just by watching a person execute a sequence of steps.  My group has argued such technology would create a way for organizations share procedural knowledge "documents" in a manner analogous to the way that traditioal documents are shared today.  We have three years of funding to prove it.  

As a researcher I focus on coming up with new (sometimes radical) approaches to solving computing problems, and then do just enough work to prove the approach is practical and useful.  Development teams later take those ideas proven useful and turn them into IBM products.  In my opinion, I spent my whole day doing the most fun (and challenging) part of the invention process.

Northern Kentucky University prepared me very well for graduate school.  I found at Ohio State that I often had as much or more familiarity with background material as did other students.  At NKU I studied both Mathematics and Computer Science; in my Junior and Senior years I also worked with several Faculty to develop specific classes that went beyond the existing curriculum.  The attention I obtained at NKU would be hard to duplicate elsewhere.  Both my studies at NKU, Ohio State, and University of Illinois, all feed into the work I am doing now.  Programming skills, diverse and in-depth parts of my mathematics background are called upon frequently.  For my research in particular, algorithm design, statistical modeling, and proof techniques often come into play.  Remaining current in my field goes beyond schooling, every year I spend significant time reading new research results, publishing, and attending conferences--just the way I like it.

I am a research scientist at the IBM T.J. Watson lab. The lab is aimed at inventing the technology that will drive computing decades ahead. It is an energetic place where ideas and prototypes rule supreme. If you know how to do it better: tell us, and then show us. People on my hallway include the guys that built the chess program that beat the world champion Kasparov. Mandelbrot is on the floor right below me, as are the guys trying to build a quantum computer and Linux on a watch. Industrial research is the place for me. I like solving technical problems, and at the same time I want that problem solving to actually have impact on the world. My current project (along with two other researchers) is to develop a machine learning algorithm which automatically produces a script just by watching a person execute a sequence of steps. My group has argued such technology would create a way for organizations share procedural knowledge "documents" in a manner analogous to the way that traditioal documents are shared today. We have three years of funding to prove it.

As a researcher I focus on coming up with new (sometimes radical) approaches to solving computing problems, and then do just enough work to prove the approach is practical and useful. Development teams later take those ideas proven useful and turn them into IBM products. In my opinion, I spent my whole day doing the most fun (and challenging) part of the invention process.

Northern Kentucky University prepared me very well for graduate school. I found at Ohio State that I often had as much or more familiarity with background material as did other students. At NKU I studied both Mathematics and Computer Science; in my Junior and Senior years I also worked with several Faculty to develop specific classes that went beyond the existing curriculum. The attention I obtained at NKU would be hard to duplicate elsewhere. Both my studies at NKU, Ohio State, and University of Illinois, all feed into the work I am doing now. Programming skills, diverse and in-depth parts of my mathematics background are called upon frequently. For my research in particular, algorithm design, statistical modeling, and proof techniques often come into play. Remaining current in my field goes beyond schooling, every year I spend significant time reading new research results, publishing, and attending conferences--just the way I like it.

### 2010.09 – Fun facts for the HACKERS CONFERENCE

Serving as 
- AI
- Self organizing

RECENTLY ACTIVITY (professional)
- Created, sold, and kicked off 5-year effort involving 100+ researchers from strongest 
  univerisities across the nation to build algorithms that can automatically translate natural 
  English text into formal knowlege 

RECENT ACTIVITIES (hobby)
- Pitched proposal to handful of folks from USAID
  for a non-profit pyramid scheme for educating exponential numbers
  in emerging world solly on the basis of loans from global equity markets.

- Wrote my own Win32 based win manager & application launcher based on huffman coding.
  Result is provably minimal key strokes for space of actions + two tricks
  to minimize cognitive load in usage.


TOYS
- The application launcher is a single .EXE file and it is GPL licenced, I will
  give it any heavy keyboard users that stands still long enough for a download.

- If I find kindred thinkers I have 3-slide into for the edu-pyrimid scheme
  (plus 40 slide full pitch with 100+ backup slides, for a more serious connection)

- A personl info manager that have written, extended, and used daily for over 12 years.
  (35K+ lines of code---the most complex info manager ever conceived.
   Agreed that this is not entirely a good thing, but it has features I have 
   never seen elsewhere, which is why I cannot yet give it up.)

URL:     http://www.autohotkey.com/   (awesome fine-grain Win32 scripting)
Book:    Fixing failed states.  Ashraf Ghani & Clare Lockhart
Toy:     Etymotic Ety headset.  sealed ear design kicks butt.  Easily carry on 
         conversation while biking/blading at speed.

Learned: Several researcher have working computational model of the hypocampical/cortical circuit.
         (this is a huge hunk of the human brain, and we have a simple model of how it self organizes!)

Given Back:  Edu-pyrimid is entirely a non-profit (albeit non-existent) idea.  
             Keyboardist is GPL licenced

### 10.00 – Wagner Example Bio
Current Whereabouts

Earlier in 2012 I left my friends at iRobot and am currently working on early stage ideas, exploring macro trends, and working independently and with other efforts at the intersection of technology and strategy. I am happy to hear from folks with interesting ideas or who are also exploring the macros.
