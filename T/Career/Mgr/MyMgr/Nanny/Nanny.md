### OLD NANNY QUESTIONS
#### --- Basic questions May ---

Dila, 

Here is our situation:  My wife works at Google and has a 2 hour commute each way... this means having someone to watch our son Eli from something like 7a to 5:30 on office days.  Right now we are trying to limit her in office days to only 3 days per week, so the other days can be lighter.

We are hoping to find someone who will gain significant value from a live in position with rent, utilities and meals included in order to notably lower their monthly rate.  But this only works if you don't already have another place you need to keep.  
-- Do you have a place you will be keeping?
-- Also can those longer hours work for you a couple days a week?
-- And how many days per week do you prefer to work?  (we can find a second person to get us up to the required 6 days a week if needed.)
-- Finally we are hoping that you are able to cook a meal each day and do the laundry.  Is this ok?  And have you ever regualarly cooked dinner for others (your family etc.)?

let me know if all of this sound like a good situation for you!
Cheers, 
Dan



#### --- Basic questions ---


Hey thanks alot for writing!  We looked at your profile and it seems like we could be a good match.  We have a couple of questions to check that we are on the same page:

-1- We are taking the Covid lockdown pretty seriously, so we are mostly not going out except to the doctor or such, are you ok beginning your time with us by sheltering in place with us -- and living with us?
-2- Are you good with $3,000/month + free room and free board.  
-3- The number one activity is taking care of Eli (our son), everything else is secondary to that.  Still we hope that during the course of the week you will be able to cook one meal per day, and do the laundry.  (we have a separate cleaner so you won't be doing that)
-4- When she goes back to work my wife's commute is 2hrs each way each day.  So on days when she goes into work, those will be longer days.
-5- Do you have a resume you could send us, even if it is not a formal one, we love to see the specific dates and jobs you had over the years.

Hoping all of this seems like a great situation for you.  If it does, let us know and we can talk about making it work together!

Cheers, 
Dan and Qingling

#### --- questions for incomming applicants ---

	Hey thanks for noticing our ad.  Seems like this could be a good match!  Here are some questions to see if we are on the same page:
	-1- How many months have you taken care of an infant (< 8months old)?
	-2- You are ok with $3,000K / month + free room and board?
	-3- You can cook, and are willing to learn & enjoy our healthy eating (plus your food too).
	-4- NOTE: Workdays will be long since my wife commutes 2hrs/day each way to work, but I work from home so you will have some free time in the middle of each day and time to go out for a walk or such each day too.  Sound ok?
	-5- You can legally work in the US, and are willing to have taxes withheld.
	Hoping all of this seems like a great situation for you.  Let us know.

	Cheers, 
	Dan

#### --- older questions ---

We are excited that living with us in SF would be an option for you.  We are looking for the newest member of our little gang and it seems like you might be a great fit!  Here are a bunch of questions (a little boring I know) but they are a quick way to check that we are on the same page:
-1- You can legally work in the US, and are willing to have taxes withheld.
-2- You are good with $3,000K / month + free room and board?
-3- You can cook, and are willing to learn & enjoy our healthy eating (plus your food too).
-4- NOTE: Workdays will be long since my wife commutes 2hrs/day each way to work, but I work from home so you will have some free time in the middle of each day and time to go out for a walk or such each day too.  Sound ok?

#### --- new2Q
Thanks for writing!  Here is a little about our situation:  We are looking for a full-time long-term person who can save on rent and food bills by eating and living with us.  Our living situation is pretty low key.  There are lots of parks near the house, and we are pretty flexible about how watch Eli and enjoy your time doing it.  Just to check that we are staring things on the same page, let me know a couple of things:  
-1- Can you legally work in the US?
-2- Have you worked with babies, and for how long?
-3- And if you have free room at board at our place what would your monthly rate be for full-time 6days/week work?

Looking forward to hearing more...

#### --- Job Ad

There is a lot (fun) to say about living at our house, living with my husband, our boy Eli, our dog, and me.  We have lots of joy in our house, and we hope that will be lots of joy for you too, our newest member of the gang.

I work down on the peninsula so I will be gone for 12 hours per day including my commute.  My husband works from home, so he can lend a hand during your work day if you need someone to watch Eli for a moment or such.  We would love it if you could help with cooking dinner, but we don't want to burden you with cleaning tasks, one little boy is quite enough!

There are coffeeshops and 3 parks in easy walk from our house, so you can easily get out with Eli as often as you like.  We are looking for a full-time long-term person who can save on rent and food bills by eating and living with us -- maybe you are our missing piece?
_
#### --- 2Q2

LEVEL 11
Thanks for the email.  Your qualifications seem great, and I think it seems like it you could be an awesome addition to our gang!  But that was the basis for my question, I can't tell if you are expecting to live with us.  We are definitely hoping so, we are aiming to save money on the monthly rate by providing free food and board.  But this is no good if you already are paying rent on another place.  So if have free room at board at our place what would your monthly rate be for 12hr/day 6days/week?

#### --- In Range response

Ellie, 
This all sound pretty good!  I am happy to negotiate rates later, that is just one of many considerations.  But to save both of our time, lets make sure we are in the right ball park.  We have been given rates of $3000-3500 per month so far, assuming free room and board.  Does that fit with your expectations?  Also just checking in that you are legally allowed to work in the US.

Let me know of both of those are a fit.  

15-20 children.... oh my!  I bet that was a handful!!  :-)

#### --- Hours Per Week response

Kaydence,

While in grad school out drinking w. one of the professors who happened to be from France.  Once drunk he explained the French was the cartesian language of logical thought...    that thinking in other languages was not a precise, since those languages were not a precise as French.  I dunno, but it couldn't hurt for our little one to learn a little french. :-)

So how do we translate the $15/hr to a monthly rate?  You will be living at our place and have primary care of Eli I am guessing from 7am to 7pm.  But I work from home, and will be able to help watch him during the day too... you will be able to run personal errands or such.  Leave early one day because you want to meet friends for dinner or such.  Seems nicest if you have primary reponsibility for Eli in those hours, and we have responsibilty for the other 12 hours, but then we all also all have flexibility and make tradeoffs to help in all directions.

$15/hr * 12hours/day * 6days/week  * 50weeks/12month = $4,500/mo

If we calculate it that way it is a very steep monthly rate.
How do you think we should do it?  We could bill 8/hr per day.

thanks, Dan

### Mary Morgan


- We straight-up dont feel good about the COVID situation,
	made my stomach hurt these last days trying to figure out what to do.
- We need to really get on the same page about this.
	- On one hand, you need to live a reasonable life& your time off is yours
	- On other hand, we are choosing a very conservative path until vaccine
	- Your not as careful as we are:  Wash hands, going into a groc store.
	- Not really thinking ``isolate in place''   (see my friend)
		- I have not seen any friends since before valentines day.
	- We can say oh yeah, oh yeah, I got no friends in CA anyway
		- you are an extrovert.
		- like to see my friend this weekend
		- wondering what gonna do for 4th 
- What we are doing
	- Mostly nothing:  
		- Not going into closed spaces.  Not into resturants, etc.
		- Not meeting people.
	- But maybe an asian family that is more HARD CORE than us.
	- And then outside @ resturant.
- So you are our biggest exposure by far.


Do all the paperwork:
- Get W2 setup.  Lets talk about money for a moment:
	- FOOD -- $20-30 per day per person.
	
- Hours.  Likely to add one hour to your day.  But when we get into a groove there will always be gaps in the day

CAN DO



**ELI** -- Mary is going to be more outgoing and be able to energize Eli more. Chinese nanny has good experience, but might not be as energetic or American enough. One thing I observed is Mary might not have enough patience, Eli never finished his breakfast with her, but he does it with us. I think it's because Mary doesn't have enough patience to keep trying to feed Eli (I didn't ding her on this one)  Maybe, but she DOES like playing w. Eli, and it shows.

**COVID** -- Mary is always going to be a higher risk.

**TRUST** -- We don't trust Mary as much as we do with this Chinese nanny.
The idea that she sat in the grass for several hours and read a book especially as evening came in.  I don't buy it.


**COOKING** -- I want chin to say:  **``Yes, I am ok learning some new recipes.''**  as long as she say yes to this, then I agree she it better than Mary.  But it is a close call since I think mary will learn many dishes including chinese ones over time.


HOURS -- I want chin and mary to both say **``yes I am ok working 10-11 hrs'**'
Seems like they are pretty similar on this

BUSY -- I want both to be ok **being busy during much but not all of their hours**.
Most time is with Eli, but cooking & kitchen is alot too.
Then occasional laundry or such.  We are paying for 10-11 hours, 8-9 of them will be busy.


FUTURE -- Mary can drive, so can pickup drop off Eli, but she is not likely to stay long term. Chinese nanny can't drive, but she might still be able to take care of Eli and help with cooking since she lives so close by

### emails
I worked full time in an infant and toddler room at a child care center during the summer of 2014. I also did full time volunteer work at an elementary school during the summer of 2015, and I was a reading tutor at an elementary school during the fall of 2015 and 2016. I have been described by previous supervisors as patient, kind, and creative, and I really enjoy working with children.

Thank you for the reply. I worked in the infant and toddler room at a child care center, and last spring I had a temporary job taking care of a girl (and her older siblings) who was 11-months-old when I started the position. I am perfectly fine with a salary of $3000 per month plus free room and board. I don't have a ton of cooking experience, but I have cooked before, and I'm also a fast learner and am health conscious. I've had long work days and don't mind them at all. I can legally work in the U. S. and am perfectly fine with having taxes withheld. Again, my subscription to care.com ends after today, so if you would like to arrange a time to talk, please call me at xxx-xxx-xxxx and leave a message, thank you., Krista.

Join in on our afternoons and our dinner!

There are a lot of (fun) things to say about time spent at our house---with my husband, our boy Eli, our dog, and me. We have lots of joy in our house, and we hope that will be lots of joy for you too, the newest member of our family.

We both work from home so we are around to lend a hand in your activties, and of course you are around to help us both survive working from home with our young one :-).  Your main job would be playing with Eli, but during his daily (long) nap you would sometime prepare a simple dinner for all of us (we have figured out a few instapot dishes that can last a couple days in order to simplify meal prep). 

We live in Bernal Heights about 15min walk from Bart.  If all of this sounds good to you, please write and we can see if we are a good match!

Join us!  Live-In Nanny Position


There is a lot (fun) to say about living at our house, living with my husband, our boy Eli, our dog, and me. We have lots of joy in our house, and we hope that will be lots of joy for you too, the newest member of our family.

I work in South bay so on my days at work I will be gone for 10-11 hrs per day including my commute. My husband works from home, so he can lend a hand during your work day if you need someone to watch Eli for a moment or such. We would love it if you could help with cooking dinner and laundry, but we don't want to burden you with other cleaning tasks, one little boy is quite enough!

We are looking for a full-time long-term person who can save on rent and food bills by eating and living with us -- are you our missing piece?.

- ALREADY better than me in quieting baby.
- One BIG ISSUE
   -  High energy, driving nature.
       --> cleaning the cabinets,  you can keep Eli attn / no cry
   -  But it is way too much for Eli's little  brain
       -  its not natural for you to let things happen at Eli speed,
           you natually take control of the action.  
              Eli, look at daddy, look look, kick this ball, push 
   - Does not become emotionally strong in-control
       Too fast to learn; 
   - most of the time you don't direct Eli, Eli directs you.
      -  Follow HIS interests / attention.
      -  You are looking at his face, you know he will cry before he even does.

### NANNY CONTRACT

	how to write a contract
	https://www.whattoexpect.com/family/finances/nanny-contract/?XID=iOS_share



	**COMPENSATION**




	Standard week is 45 hours over 6 days.
	We just knock off (or add 7.5h for each day above/below)

	Paying for 45 hours / week at $15.59/hr =$701.55/wk =$3040/mo $2923/mo

	$3000 * 12mo/yr / 52 week/yr / 6day/wk = $115.38/day ~7.4hr/d  44.4h/w
	$3000 * 12mo/yr / 50 week/yr / 45hr/wk = $16/hr
	$3000 * 12mo/yr / 50 week/yr / $15.59/hr = 46.183hr
		8h=$124.72 


	$3000 * 12mo/yr / 50 week/yr / 6day/wk = $120/day  ~ 7.697hr
	$3000 * 12mo/yr / 50 week/yr / 45hr/wk = $16/hr
	$3000 * 12mo/yr / 50 week/yr / $15.59/hr = 46.183hr
		8h=$124.72 


	

	$3,000 per month for 6 days per week @ 12 hours/day 
	$2,500 per month for 5 days per week @ 12 hours/day

	All meals, housing, utilities, etc. are included.


	LAWS
	$15.59/hr upto 45hr
	1 hour sick for 30hr worked


	**PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY**
	- **ELI** -- Primary responsibilty is taking care of Eli, everything else is secondary to this aim.  So we are keeping all other responsibilities to a minimum.


	**SECONDARY RESPONSIBILIES**
	- **COOKING DINNER** -- We don't need anything fancy here, but we do want to be eating healthy.  Qingling loves Chinese food, so we hope to teach a few simple recipies if you don't already know some.  We often have a simple dinner:  some kind of stir fried chicken/pork veggies -- and anything you also want.
	- **LAUNDRY** -- We have a super-sized washing machine, so we don't need many loads per week.  You can do all of our clothing at the same time.  We also have many extras of our clothing, so our laundry does not need to be done frequently.
	- **ERRAND** -- Generally you would not be expected to run errands, in some cases there could be one or at most two errands to be done in a week.

	**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES** 
	- **CLEANING** -- There are NO cleaning responsiblies with this job.  Of course you will clean after your own personal stuff, and keeping the kitchen clean as part of cooking.  But no sweeping, no bathrooms, etc.

	**OTHER TOPICS**
	- **PHONE/LAPTOP USAGE** -- While you are "on the clock" Eli is the main focus so you generally wont be making social text/calls.  (Of course a quick coordination call is fine, but social chatting/texting isn't)

	- **HOURS** -- Your nominal hours are 12 per day.  There will likely be some gaps in your day where Eli is napping or busy, and a moment here or there in the evening when you can help out if you happen to still be at home that day.
### NANNY GOALS

	$2K for 

	$3K+2K+500 = $5.5K/mo = $66K/yr = $220/d = $18.3/hr
	$5K = $200/d = $16.7/hr

	-- Will train Eli energetically.
	-- Would pay $500/$1K mo more for a legal nanny
	-- Nice To have:  Chinese Cooking, English Speaking, 
	-- Able to work some in the evenings, likes interacting&teaching


	- HOURS -- 12/day nominal hours.  But living in the house and having primary responsibilty for Eli, so will still help out, outside working hours if at home and around.  Family will be flexible too, helping with Eli if you need to run a personal errand etc.
	- COOKING / LAUNDRY -- Basic cooking (dinner only) and laundry for both yourself and for us are part of the job.  We might each lunch together too, or not depending on the day, and on your desire.  We are not expecting gormet food, just a few healthy choices.  we love veggies lots to we will be buying lots.  Chinese food is great too, but we are open to lots of healthy dishes.
	- CLEANING -- We will have a separate cleaner so that is not part of your duties.
	- ELI GROWTH -- Kids pick up alot.  So we are focused on him having lots of
