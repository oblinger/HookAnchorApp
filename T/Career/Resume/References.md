Grzegorz,

Here are the bullet points I have for your letter of recommend.  My understanding is that you want the next stage of your career to focus on the senior most individual contributor roles (rather than management) and you want to become increasingly specialized into machine learning, AI, and deep learning.  So the bullet points below are aiming in that direction.  If my assumptions are wrong, let me know, and I can adjust accordingly:


- Grzegorz is among the very 
- The strongest 

- Raise


==============================



As someone who has had the privilege of working with Dan on multiple projects, I can confidently say that they are an exceptional leader and manager. His ability to effectively oversee a team of over 30 PhDs and another 30 software engineers, each with their own complex research agendas, is truly remarkable. Dan has a rare combination of strong communication skills, excellent organizational abilities, and the ability to build trust and foster collaboration within their team. I have no doubt that Dan will change the fate of a couple more breakthrough projects.

  

As a technical leader, Dan consistently demonstrates a strong ability to quickly analyze and understand complex problems, and to develop and implement effective solutions. In one instance, I had to report an unexpected issue to Dan. This was a serious blocker to the development roadmap. Within a 30-minute call Dan decomposed the problem into tiny aspects. I left that call with a clear set of new things that had to be checked to unblock the team. Dan's ability to analyze and synthesize information quickly and accurately is truly exceptional!

  

Also, Dan is a remarkable AI expert that brings industry-changing ideas. He has a unique ability to see beyond the current landscape and imagine what is possible in the future. Dan is able to clearly articulate his vision and inspire others to join them in bringing it to life. His vision for the framework for building AI for the unstructured environment robot was driving the team. Dan was both the source of the idea and an expert that was able step-by-step lead the development effort towards the goal.
