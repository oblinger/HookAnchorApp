## Walking Wallet

7:3  now those are my kind of numbers!

when I was there, I did not really see that kind of split though.
but i did see that there were not so many educated guys....  so if you were an educated woman looking for an educated guy.... well that WAS going to work out rather well for me!

> Plus most of the Filipinas that you saw with older foreigners I think most of them works in the club.

Hmmm, I see.  well yes, I did find lots of very grabby club girls.  Feel like a walking wallet.   I remember hooking up w. a group of rich kids (both sexes).  they seemed pretty fun, but i got an odd vibe from the group.  Anyway, it is 4 in the morning -- time to go to the next club, so they invite me along  (no I am not usually out at 4am clubbing... but i was on vacation, and I love to dance)....
anyway, so I go along... they have a nice car, etc. etc.

one of the girls sort of invites me to buy a round of drinks for the group.
....  ok, ok.  I am not a tight wad.... and she is cute -- yes we boys really never mature that much.  So I do -- but before I can order we are off to the next place.

There a different girl just sort of assumes that I will be buying a bottle of booze for the whole group.  its not a big group -- but I did not even make friends w. the whole group yet.

walking wallet!

yeah, I was so pissed off, I managed to just sneak out on the whole group, and just caught a cab home -- the sun was coming up.


it was fine -- it was a fun night -- danced with a transvestite -- met an expat friend that i remain buddies with to this day.

still I went home feeling a bit lonely....   lonely that I could never really trust that the ways people were acting towards me were truthful.

That is not always the way I felt in Php, but it was a common question in my mind.

## TOO HARD TO ANSWER MAYBE COFFEE

I am trying to get a sense of your daily life:  tell me about your weekends, what do you often do (both work and play).
For me it is working on my startup, and being social -- though I dont yet have many friends here.  its actually hard to really answer that question w/o writing alot. Maybe one of these trips I can grab a coffee with you.



## Telling my story about going to the philippines.

Thank you Ryden!
(I am curious, are you settling down with a Foreigner?)


As for me, now that I am officially "just friends" with you let me tell you my story:

I have dating two people for a very long time (over TEN years).  Both were long distance relationships, and I can say now, that it is silly to date someone that long w/o marrying them.  but I did it!

Now I am 47, but still look quite young, and still want the 'standard' family.
I recently moved to San Francisco and am finding there are many potential
women here to marry.  Still given my aim for a family they must be a bit younger 
than me, and I am pretty attracted to the skinnier sorts, not all american's fit that 
picture.  Most of all I hope to find one that is mentally healthy, happy, and Christian.

Sometimes these things don't happen in after a woman (or a man) has been dating for decades in the big city!

So I had the idea to work for a month or so from a place like the Philippines and see who I meet.  But I am not quite sure how to go about this.  A month is not so very long,
and my idea is NOT to find an internet bride!  I would want to just meet people and 
get a feeling if being in the Philippines is a good place for me.  Then maybe I could
come back for a longer time.

I thought to somehow get connect to a university over there.  I have a Ph.D., and while I don't expect my wife to have one, I do think we would have the most in common, if my partner had an academic and/or professional background -- I think 
we would have the most in common that way.


So I have written alot!  but what do you think... does coming to Cebu for a month, and traveling on weekends for taking multi-day short trips make sense?

How could I get into groups where I would be meeting professional/academic woman (and men) socially?  I don't need to be dating these people...  just meeting would let me know if being in the Philippines would be a good thing... and also if you meet someone -- dating is easy if both people are excited about it!


Thanks in advance for your help Ryden!

--dan


P.S.  I hope to be very frank and honest w. my ideas and my questions.
if any question or idea is offensive -- I will be grateful if you just
tell me so!


## ASKING and ABOUT ME
go-mop-som-nee-da

ok so that is my sad attempt at Korean.

actually I have a funny story about Korean...  In graduate school I studied with a group of Koreans.  It was mostly a group of women (that was kind of nice ;-)  and there was one guy almost done with his PhD.  His name was  "o-pa"
One day he came down to study, and I saw him from across the room, so I called out "Hey O-pa!"  

He was furious!  and the women could not stop laughing.

really!  language is just too confusing.....  everyone _else_ called him O-pa...

have you travelled outside the Philippines?  or inside?
introverted or extroverted?
curly fries, or regular?

actually I dont know what to ask...  it is hard to know someone this way!

(for me, I am a pretty big extrovert, and kinda nerdy -- hello ph.d!  and I love being social, but usually with others that are a little professional / academic.
but still I am happy to be out dancing or whatever -- it is just nice if the conversation is a little more intellectual between the songs  ;-)



## INTELLECTUAL

 
> You're a good, kind person who is also interesting, smart and dynamic.

Its not humble to say the list above describes me.  but it does, and these
are the very qualities that I hope to share with my mate.  

And I can tell from your smiling eyes in almost every picture you have, that you are a kind person -- it is interesting how irrationally certain I am of this, just is reading your profile, and looking at your pictures!

I love playful sarcasm too.  Nothing mean, and only a little cutting -- nothing is funnier than something with just an edge of truth to it!  Still I have a 'dog's personallity.  Loyal, warm, and always wanting to please....  so my teasing is never ill intentioned... and on those occasions where teasing went was a little too close to the truth, I put even more energy into making sure no feelings stay hurt.

= Building relationships and strong friendships
like you this is a super strong desire and skill on my part--I just moved here, and feel a little out of my element--all of my close friends are so far away.  Still I am an extrovert--so building many new acquaintances on the way to friends now...

you say you are good at cooking and entertaining.
I love it!  I have aspired to such, but if I am truthful, I am really good AT the party, making sure that all feel included and having fun at the party.  But I suck at the planning part, and well I am a guy...  with a guys blunt skill in the kitchen.   (but as a team, we could put on quite a sware....  I'm just sayin'  ;-)

I have a pretty strong intellectual side (hello Ph.D.) go figure.  I've learn from experience that this means I fit best with intellectually curious sorts.... the sort that will have thoughts and ideas after watching a movie, and will want to talk about them.  For me this is the spice of life -- both w. friends and a mate.  both out on friday nite, and laying in bed on Sunday morning.

Not sure if this is you -- your profile is not as wordy as mine (grins), but I am hopeful.

anyway, I have written quite enough here for a first note!  As you can see I do get strong impressions on occasion when looking at these profiles...   and I definitely get a very warm impression with yours.

happy new year!!
---danny

P.S.  do you have a church you like in the city?  any ones to recommend in the mission area?



## I REALLY NOTICED YOU

## CHARMING VS STALKER

SF Girl:

There is a fine line between between charming persistence and creepy stalking.
I wanna stay firmly in the former camp, but recognize writing a second time

## NO RESPONSE -- TELL ME WHAT TO DO

SF Girl:

is it time for me to give up here? I don't want to! I mean how can i really be smitten by you.... it just a couple of photos, and a page of text. But no, I do think I have a sense of you... and I bet SF girl in person would not dissapoint!

Still it takes two of us to see potential here.... so far I think I am the only one, or maybe you are busy fending off all those _other_ guys... or maybe you have a healthy social life, and OKC is just not where you put your energies.

So let me know.... if it is the latter two categories, hey I am fine fighting the good fight. I bet we would have fun, and I am still hopeful you would be worth the energy!!

but there is a fine line between the smitten boy sweetly expressing ardor, and that creepy guy who wont leave me alone.

throw me a bone.... let me know if it is busy-ness or zero interest.

## About me

about me:

I am the CTO for a small startup, we are trying to change they way online group purchasing happens.

I am super social by nature -- I love talking a little too much  ;-)

I am a geek, so I like ideas, academic things, science things, technology things, and I will talk about them if I get the chance.

I am super warm in person -- giving hugs for hello and good bye to everyone -- kind of friends and friendly with most around me -- typically in a teasing goofy kind of way.

If I were an animal, I would be a sloppy happy dog -- too happy to know you -- too boisterous not to show it.

### Profile ideas  11/2012

http://www.okcupid.com/profile/watermellon_gun?cf=regular_indirect

doing w. life:  I started a software company with some gents

six things never w/o:
   I only need four.


You should message me if
if you can help me convince myself that I am indeed a winner. my life is in your hands. no pressure.


The first things people usually notice about me
definitely my ass.

Are you even reading this shit anymore? Haven't you already formed your 5 minute (if that) opinion of me by now?

Pic alone --
Here I am out with friends, obviously I am very popular. And you can tell by our silly pose, that we get all sorts of crazy!

Randop pic
Obligatory shirtless shot. My fucking abs cannot be matched.


MOST private things

I took a pic without a shirt on, to show off my abs, but decided not to post it.

I've been accused of being dainty. I put the toilet seat down after, and dab, not shake. I sleep with a lot of pillows.




### Edits for Match 11/2012
SUMMARY
Inventor (dozen+ patents & companies), traveller (5 continents), professor (ivy league), government agent (the secret kind), 
charming billionare batchelor who fights crime from a secret high tech cave below his mansion...  oh wait that’s batman.

Truly though, I would not trade in my decades of doing, but it has helped me keep my head buried deeply in my rear. 
I have been building much, but not the things that matter most. It has been easy to do, I look ten years younger than I am; 
blessed with an awesome circle of friends and partners, it has been easy to pretend I was going to have all of this AND the 2.3 kids, 
my trusted dog living in my white picketed front yard.
Well no more. I am still the CTO for a startup, but I have re-structured my responsibilities (and my equity) in order to make 
finding my mate, my number one priority. Not rushing, but my plan is to apply the same focus I have put to other things into this one. 
I am betting I will have my best luck offline, but leaving no rock unturned I am online too… (you know, not that I am saying we are under a rock here)

GOOD AT
Thinking differently in ways that have impact.

PEOPLE NOTICE
Contagious enthusiasm.

FAV BOOKS/MOVIES
Ethnic and spicy—food! I am talking about food. You know, a killer salsa or Kimchi Chigae. Movies/Books: Murikomi, Chinua Achebe, Miyazaki, David Allen (yes, I am list nerd), and always up for the latest in mindless mainstream whatever as long as it is NOT horror, and I am out w. good friends.

NEVER DO WITHOUT
Intelligent conversation.
Close friends.
My 14 hour laptop battery . . . it lets me work all day in the craziest places.
My Hybrid Bike—probably the way I will travel to meet you.
Marty, my over fed, and oh-so-happy tabby.
Love

WHAT I THINK ABOUT
everyTHING. For me everything is a THING—a puzzle to solve and to talk about! World Politics, yesterday’s movie plot, how our friend should manage some problem with his boss, anything spiritual, anything scientific. Am always building a better mousetrap—on the ski-lift how to cover more runs with one lift, or a self-sustaining vocational training scheme to educate and create jobs in Africa. On the Internet—a new kind of message board that forces conservatives and liberals to talk to each other rather than talking past each other.


FRIDAY NITE
Out on a date, dinner with friends, … or snuggled at home with takeout and the latest Myazaki flick.

PRIVATE THING
As a grade schooler I was convinced that girls could all read minds, but they just weren’t letting on. To catch you guys I would try to suddenly think of some shocking thing (you know, shocking for a ten year old), then watch for inadvertent reactions in nearby girl’s faces. Really even today… how can I know for sure???

## Short Clips

I've been told by others that I have charisma, charm and passion.

I have the taste of a 14 year-old virgin: Mad Max, the Bourne films, the new 007 movies. However, I'll watch anything once, even a rom-com with Jennifer Aniston in it (grudgingly).

Doing something low-key because the week has usually wrung me dry...but it depends on which direction those aforementioned cocktails take me.

You should message me if:  you are three or more of the following: sexy, stylish, brainy, silly, hyper-literate, attentive to your surroundings, artsy, maybe also craftsy, open-minded, empathetic, fit, a bundle of contradictions, you like messing around, like to cook, you smell nice

#### Really Good At
-  and of course devastating legal persuasion (that's hot and you know it).
- being a gentleman, chivalry isn't dead.
Im good at fixing things
- Delivering Best Man speeches at my friends’ weddings.
- Being a loyal friend.
- Saying what that dog is thinking


#### Favorites
- I'm not sure. I'm fairly certain nobody evaluating my profile will care.
- I don't wanna list what music I'm into. Judging people that way is way too high school. If your tastes aren't varied, we probably won't get along- but that goes for books, food, movies, music and several other things as well.

#### Cant do w/o
- The six things I could never do without

SMART ASS
- Cant do w/o: I can't believe they haven't gotten rid of this question yet. OMG YOU COULD NEVER DO WITHOUT YOUR FRIENDS OR PASSPORT OR IPHONE ME NEITHER LET'S GET MARRIED!
- Think about:  I spend a lot of time thinking about:   The detrimental ramifications of rock and roll in contemporary society. And space. Lots of time thinking about space.
- The most private thing I’m willing to admit:  I've cried watching the food network.
- You should message me if: You listen to good music. Or just really like music. OK, you should at least be able to tap your foot.
                          - You're a little bit punk rock and not a jerk. (I stole this one from somebody because I liked it a lot. This isn't a term paper it's cool.)

#### People Notice 
- generous tipper?
- I use fifty cent words when monosyllabic ones will suffice. See?
- my uncanny resemblance to Brad Pitt.
That they can't always tell when I'm joking
That I'm usually joking
- I can nap like a CHAMPION. You're gonna love me.


#### Spend time thinking about
- How stuff works
- How to put it
- What I should probably be paying attention t... oooooh, shiny

#### You should message me if

- you're smart, interesting, and fun. You have a playful mind. The way to my heart is through my brain. Physical attraction is important, but people look more or less attractive depending on how they interact with you on a mental level. Physical connection, mental connection-- this is a false dichotomy. They're inseparable.

- LONG You should message me if you're a brown-eyed girl, petite and between 5' and 5'6, and you have three or more photos (any less makes you seem fake) which are current and not over two years old (you might look differently today) been on here less than a year( you might not be serious or have too many dating/ relationship issues. it depends) you are confident, have class, display charm, style, poise and grace, and take care of yourself. You are sociable, love parties (I don't mean drinking ones)) or going out dancing (not a big club thing), and have friends like I do, vivacious, positive, in touch with your own sensuality, sweet, playful, intelligent, loves and cares about people, nature, kids and animals, thinks outside the box, optimistic, believes in God and was brought up Catholic or Christian, love sipping champagne on special occasions, imaginative and humorous, say what's on your mind without being insulting or rude, can keep up with me, respect yourself, not clinging or insecure. If you have some of these qualities or think you have what it takes to attract me, I want to hear from you. Extra points for good kissers who love to kiss and be kissed like me.  I believe in meeting for a drink (alcohol or non-alcohol) or possibly a light meal somewhere quiet and not noisy. Now, let's be respectful when we meet and ladies try to keep your hands to yourself. I am not easy. lol. I'm not into being interviewed like I'm applying for a job nor do I want to discuss the weather. Let's share some light, relaxing and humorous conversation. Be yourself.  Furthermore, a relationship takes time and it should not be rushed. Patience is a virtue. Don't look for love. It finds you.  Life is short. Carpe diem ( seize the day) . Peace.


## Long Clips

### Self Summary

#### Soulful, Honest, Funny
My self-summary
I suppose I'm a bit of a contradiction in terms - I'm sure I come across as extroverted, but at the same time I know myself to be quite cerebral and focused. I'm as content listening to old school hip-hop while going for a run as I am sitting quietly for hours reading, writing and doing research.
- I know that life isn't long, but it certainly is WIDE - and so I love the idea of exposing myself to as much of it as possible - and as such, I think that curiosity, interest, and passion go a long way.
What else?
- Intelligence is sexy, funny is sexy, confidence is sexy, and well... sexy is sexy.
- We're all a bit mad, a bit eccentric, and whether we like to admit it or not, we all come with some baggage - but the ability to laugh at ourselves and our foibles is invaluable and certainly mitigates a lot.
- The older I get, the more I'm amazed at how little it really takes to be happy, to have fun, and to enjoy yourself. (I attribute that lesson to experience, and my daughter - who, as far as I can tell, is made of magic and cupcake frosting.)
- By the way, in the event that some of this may sound a bit metaphysical - I can assure you I'm much more apt to be channeling Bugs Bunny than the Budha (although they both have their strong points and probably would have probably gotten on famously).
But I digress... ultimately, I guess it's this simple: have a listen to Frank Sinatra singing "I get a kick out of you" - I'd like to meet someone who can feel that way about me, and who would be equally delighted to have me feel that way about them.
And while I don't like to discriminate on the basis of geography, I've found it challenging to date anyone who doesn't live in Manhattan or Brooklyn.
Good luck to all.

#### Adventure-Inventor
My self-summary
- Adventurous physician, entrepreneur (biotech), inventor (a drug, not a mousetrap), have been up Kilimanjaro, climbed the Great Wall, stood on the tip of Cape Horn, survived the Zambezi River on a “bad day” (though just barely - not kidding), and have survived overnight with my 4 nieces & 2 nephews (can make the Zambezi seem pretty tame, actually!). I love adventurous trips (& adventures can be had ANYWHERE & not just in way-out-of-the-way places!), and am perhaps most proud of having been described to someone as "intrepid" which, I hope I am. I love all the cultural things in the city: the MET, the Met, and the Mets, the MoMA & the Guggenheim, the jazz clubs, the theater - so much to do, & now making the time. I am, incredibly, still a hopeful romantic (yes, still), dedicated friend/brother/uncle/son/physician, and will admit unapologetically to being a sucker for romantic comedies and happy endings (so shoot me).
- Though I've found some incredible places in this world, I'm looking for that person who can lead me to all the places in life I could never find on my own. You, are someone that I admire. You are adventurous. You are optimistic. You are both smart, and wise. You are kind. You are strong and self-assured, both professionally and personally, but know that we are always there for each other. You are passionate. You help me continue to be all those things too. You enjoy your extended family & you see a great guy & your own kids somewhere in your future that will make it even greater.

#### Tired of single
- My self-summary
Here it is, the last Saturday morning of 2012 and I'm making coffee for one- exactly how I didn't want to spend the end of the year. So... what are your plans for 2013? Surely we can improve on this.
It's hard to get a sense of anyone from these profiles. Do they all read the same to you too? Do all the guys "love to laugh," "work hard and play hard?" Is every single woman in New York "just as comfortable in jeans and a tee as in that little black dress?" I think we should turn the site into a drinking game. (Or, as someone suggested, it already is a drinking game.)
I see dating as something of a nuisance- or at least the endless string of first dates that is internet dating can be. I look forward to knowing you, but the whole process of finding you is exhausting. Work hours are long, time is tight. But while it would be nice to think my social life took care of itself, I can see quite clearly it doesn't- and if you're out here too, maybe we have that in common.
I'm a smart, funny, nurturing kind of guy, a creative type who often gets lost in work and seems to never actually go out. I'm the sort of person that other people seem to really open up to. People love telling me stories, and I love them for it. I'm a better listener than talker, but when I do speak up, I make a conscious effort not to be a story topper.

[picture of pizza]
- This would have been much better if you were here to enjoy it with me. And maybe to help with the dishes.



### Spend Time Thinking about
- Sweet Jesus, is everybody out there looking for a partner in crime? I'm going to have to start doing background checks.
How, in this age of digital photography so many of you have photos so blurry they look like they were shot from a spyplane.
My brain's running a constant reel of cartoons that bear a strange resemblance to real life- only much funnier. With a lot more sex.
Yeah, sex. I have fond memories and hope to do it again someday. You should join me- I hear it's all the rage.

Bread baker turned Italian guidebook writer turned downtown lawyer turned international development law consultant, with several non-profit side projects.

Loves (partial list): eating, growing food, cooking, working with my hands, chatting face-to-face, giving and taking, pushing and pulling.

Distrustful of generalizations; hard working, dependable, kind and warm-hearted; very, very curious; outdoorsy and indoorsy (will hold the door; not afraid to knock on doors); part country mouse/part city mouse, but not very mouse-y at all. Tactile and tactful. I show up and pay attention.

Liberal leaner and Friend of the Tool Lending Library. Soft spot for George McGovern - have you seen One Bright Shining Moment?

Yoga enthusiast and aspiring meditator. Believer in the sacramental aspect of walking, the long now and the slow reveal.

Tenacious in the best and worst of ways, and fiercely loyal. I do not give up easily on situations, people, or myself.

Looking for a lovely, independent, kind, spirited and grounded woman to take a seat at my table. (I have kept my eye out for you around the late stone fruit in the produce section of the Berkeley Bowl and at the farmer’s market, but I guess you are waiting for the persimmons to appear in earnest?)

Hope you will be – for the most part – down with yourself, ready to hit the trail or take the wheel, stake your ground, call it like you see it, play it as it lays, and go against the grain, all as need be. (There will be plenty of nap time, too.)

You know the measure of your powers; honesty is your best policy; you keep your cool most of the time. If you embrace what is unique about you, chances are I will, too.

You challenge and surprise me - and vice versa - make me laugh at the world (myself included, of course).

We find each other superhot.

You are the bee in my bonnet. (Figuratively; I do not actually wear a bonnet.)
I’m really good at

surprises
the long and winding road (not the song)
I spend a lot of time thinking about
too many things, of course. Including:

my next meal
how great ideas might be better shared
accountability
origins

the design of my future/imaginary house (life)

Talking, listening, and math*. This I believe is a rare combination. And, I have been told, kissing††. And making you laugh. (Not at the kissing.)
The first things people usually notice about me
Probably that I look younger than I am, which is good, except when I get carded at Whole Foods. People usually don't notice that I am Irish because I've lost my accent. That's a shame, but I've also lost interest in drinking 12 pints of Guinness in one sitting and I can still talk the hind legs off a horse when I need to.
Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food
Some of my favorite writers: David Mitchell, Michael Chabon, Douglas Adams, Jared Diamond, Richard Dawkins.

Some books I read and enjoyed in the last 12 months:
Empire of the Summer Moon, Blindness, Room, Better, The Emperor of Maladies, Mystic River, Cutting for Stone, The Unbearable Lightness of Being.

I trust the Economist, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and Ira Glass. All others pay cash.

Some of my favorite movies: His Girl Friday, Fargo, Groundhog Day, Reservoir Dogs, The Incredibles, Glengarry Glen Ross, Capturing The Friedmans, The Commitments, Pan's Labyrinth. Last year I loved the Artist, Contagion, Midnight in Paris, and 50/50.

TV:
The Wire, Breaking Bad, Sherlock, Dexter, Mad Men, Doctor Who, Game of Thrones, Archer.

This profile was brought to you by: Florence and the Machine (awesome show at Shoreline Amphitheatre recently), The Black Keys, The Raconteurs, Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, Jack White, John Lee Hooker, John Coltrane, The Smiths, David Bowie, Radiohead, A Tribe Called Quest, The Flaming Lips, Daft Punk, and Nirvana ... and Radiolab, This American Life, Planet Money, and The Moth.

I love Paris, Saigon, Sydney, Buenos Aires, Yellowstone, Barcelona, Istanbul, Halong Bay, Angkor, and Bolivia (all of it).

Comedians: Eddie Izzard, Mitch Hedberg, Louis CK.

Games: Words With Friends (used to be Scrabble, but Scrabble is now Words With Friends for people who have no friends).

Food: all of it. Lately I've been roasting chickens vertically (beer can style), broiling fish, and seeking the perfect bread for French toast.

Sports: running, hiking, climbing, diving, but never watching.
The six things I could never do without
I spent a year travelling around the Pacific and fitted everything I needed into a backpack. I spent another year living in a furnished apartment with everything I owned in storage, and I didn't feel the need to pay conjugal visits to my stuff. I love my books and indoor plumbing, but all I need are friends and family.

I'm financially secure, so maybe I'm taking an awful lot for granted.
I spend a lot of time thinking about
How much is enough. Evolution. How to inspire people and how to stay inspired. What do squid think about? What assumptions am I concealing from myself and are they correct? Why do we have our teeth examined every six months but no other part of our bodies? Should I rip out this spiral staircase or upholster it? Why have no aliens contacted us yet? Who is going to work for the rich kids if we write off another generation of poor kids and seal the borders?
On a typical Friday night I am
... glad that my life does not revolve around Fridays.
The most private thing I’m willing to admit
What is the most private thing that I am willing to admit here? I can't decline to answer because I've already shared private information here. This question used to confuse me ... and that is my answer.

## where to go for professional


Clarina,

I am out of your age range....  so you are a good person to ask advice since I am not asking about you.

So I may have a chance to do some work for a few months remotely.
If I came to the Philippines where should I go:
- good internet connection
- can meet, date, and have professional / academic friends

this site does not seem to be good for finding more professional/educated types.
where do you recommend that I go?

Thanks for the advice!

### Buddist honest
---- "Im looking for.....

I'm solid, straightforward and honest. I'm optimistic, playful, emotionally available and I don't play head games. My most attractive features are my smile and passion for life. I'm gentle in my words and actions, as well as being a good communicator and listener. I'm passionate about helping people, doing good in the world and leaving as small a footprint as possible.

Im looking to meet someone who is happy inside, has a good view of the world and her place within it. A woman who takes care of herself physically, as well as emotionally and maybe has some sense of spirituality or a spiritual practice of her own. Someone who speaks her mind, knows what she wants and what she needs from another person. A woman who enjoys being playful, intimate, laughing and creating passion and memories together. Someone who is not afraid of seizing opportunities when they arise and being spontaneous.

I enjoy road trips, hiking, camping and the outdoors and I'm an avid photographer and traveler, but also love city life, art, music, dining, drinks and fun times in almost any situation. I love to cook and spend time at home, watching movies, reading, listening to music, exchanging massage and cuddling, but I'm always up for a spontaneous night out or road trip. I'd love to find a soul mate, best friend and lover who shares similar interests and can also teach and show me her way of living authentically. I'm looking for a feminine woman who can be totally down to earth, is not be afraid to let her hair down, and can tell me exactly what she wants and needs from me.

I'm on OKcupid because I'm interested in meeting someone who, like myself, is looking to develop a relationship if the chemistry is right. Life is so much more fun when you have someone special to share it with!

"In a world where finding a mate is no small feat, some Anglerfishes have evolved an extraordinary strategy. The tiny male angler searches for a female by smell, then bites into her and becomes permanently attached. Eventually his mouth fuses to her body, his gut degenerates, his blood vessels merge with hers and he becomes little more than an attached sperm sac available at any time to fertilize her eggs. In some species females have several males embedded in their bodies."

You want commitment, ladies? Are you sure??

Hello! Thanks for stopping by... I am a very ambitious yet easy going type of individual. As far as activities.... I am a TOTAL WATER BUM beaches, lakes, rivers, pools etc.. Camping, Fishing, Just got into Snowboarding, Love weekend getaways and of course traditional sports play a huge part...basket ball and soccer especially. Music plays a large part in my life. I pretty much love anything with a rhythm to it, especially salsa, meringue, hip hop R&B some rock and so on and so on.... Well.... for now I think I better leave the rest for our future chats :o) .........................I can only recieve emails

Ahhhhh.......... hmmmmm...Ok............ 
I am very outgoing and not afraid to scrap my knee, get hands dirty or make you smile in a pair of heels…
in turn I am looking for the male version to compliment…..................... I want someone who loves to oooh woooow at amusement parks, 
play in the water with me (If you could teach me to surf…. You’ll have me smiling for days on end), enjoy jeeping around endlessly 
with the top down (definite plus if you were into off roading), used to dirt bike so I love motorcycles, I hate the cold but will 
always be up for some ice skating, tubing, snowboarding/skiing (mind you I don’t glide down the mountain I tumble) ………
I could go on and on … just pretty much up for whatever even if that’s being lazy under my comforter with my remote
 control in hand or stepping out to a play and dinner (I love trying new foods…as long as it is not moving …were good) :o)
 ......................... In the long run I want to be able to talk to my partner as a partner. Someone I could build with and 
strive with to attain separate and joint career & family goals. I have one life and I intend to share it with a person who understands
 that this one life is not meant to be spent on unnecessary drama. There is enough drama outside ...I do not want it embracing me when 
I walk through the door. When the bumps do arise we need to be able to talk our way over them...together...not at each other. At the 
same time I must be able to enjoy all the in between moments by stamping them with smiles and laughs as we enjoy whatever may be at hand..
traveling, playing, relaxing or just trying and experiencing something new. I am very active and very involved I need someone that 
brings the same. Yet that’s what we all hope for in some form or fashion in the long run............................I can only recieve 
emails
