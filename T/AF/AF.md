### m2022-09-07  AF Tax Discussion (with Nick)
#AF-legal   [[@Nick Allen]]

1. Formed HoldCo as a C-corp 
   
2. Exchanged 100% AF shares for 100% shares in HoldCo
   ==> N&D owns holdco  which owns AF-shares
3. We converted AF to an LLCs
4. AF transfers IP to holdco
5. HoldCo buy back part of its shares back from N&D in exchange for AF-share
6. HoldCo merges with RzeroMerger Corp
          N&D exchanges remain shares of holdco for cash and RZ-stock
          
7. RzeroMergerCorp merges into RzeroSubLLC (owned by Rzero)


Filing 2021 AF-LLC in december return (money coming in and out); Filing 2022 return as well
Filing 2021 HoldCo corp tax return 

.....
  
Here is an overview write-up of the transaction flow & intended tax consequences.

1.  Restructuring:
    1.  Starting Point - New Dawn Analytics Inc. (“New Dawn”) is your C Corporation, the target entity for the acquisition by R-Zero Systems, Inc. (“Buyer”).
    2.  Stock Repurchase – One of you sells shares back to New Dawn for nominal consideration, to adjust the ownership of New Dawn between the founders.  Intended tax consequence – this is a taxable sale of shares, but at nominal gain / loss (or no gain / loss).
    3.  ND Holdco Formation - You form ND Holdco, Inc. (the “ND Holdco”) (see Formation of Company Documents) and contribute all of your respective shares of New Dawn to ND Holdco in exchange for the shares of ND Holdco (pursuant to the Founder Share Exchange Agreements), AND just after the contribution, New Dawn is converted to a limited liability company under state law (see Conversion Documents).  Intended tax consequence – (i) because ND Holdco is the sole owner of New Dawn, following the contribution and LLC conversion, New Dawn is considered a disregarded entity for tax purposes and (ii) because the shareholders own ND Holdco in the same proportions as they held New Dawn, the transfer is treated as an F-reorganization (under 368(a)(1)(F)), meaning ND Holdco is considered to be a continuation of the New Dawn corporation for tax purposes.  All the business assets are technically held by New Dawn (since the assets haven’t been transferred through these initial steps), but for tax purposes, they are considered owned by ND Holdco because New Dawn is a disregarded entity. 
    4.  IP Transfer - Business assets, primarily IP, are transferred from New Dawn to ND Holdco (see IP Assignment Agreement).  Intended tax consequence - this transfer has no tax effect, since New Dawn is a disregarded entity for tax purposes, such assets were already considered to be owned by ND Holdco for tax purposes (even prior to such transfer). 
2.  Transaction with Buyer:
    1.  Redemption / Zenz Distribution – Shares of ND Holdco stock are repurchased / redeemed by ND Holdco, in exchange for the LLC interests in New Dawn.  At this point, New Dawn only holds assets that the Buyer does not want (because the IP was already transferred up to ND Holdco), and New Dawn is effectively transferred to each of you (in exchange for a portion of your ND Holdco shares).  Intended tax consequence – because this is planned as part of the merger with buyer (described next), it is intended to be a taxable exchange of ND Holdco shares by each of you under the principles of _Zenz v. Quinlivan_ (see Section 5.4 of Merger Agreement).  If the assets of New Dawn have gain in them, then the gain should be reported by ND Holdco as additional corporate income subject to corporate taxes, as this is considered a distribution of appreciated assets by a C corporation. You are both treated as receiving proceeds for the exchange of ND Holdco shares in a taxable transaction, which would be considered capital gain to you (to the extent the value of New Dawn / its assets exceeds your basis in your shares), although it is expected that this shareholder gain is excludible under QSBS rules.  You are also each deemed to have transferred all of the New Dawn assets to a new partnership for tax purposes, since New Dawn is no longer a disregarded entity and it is an LLC owned by each of you.  Gain has already been recognized on those assets by ND Holdco, so they should have a full FMV basis at this point.  If there are receivables, for example, when New Dawn is paid the receivable, there should be no additional income because that income should already be reported by ND Holdco (as a result of the distribution of New Dawn).   Cash held by New Dawn at the time of distribution should have no gain/loss and should also have full basis. 
    2.  Merger Transaction – Buyer sets up R-Zero Merger Corp (“Merger Sub”) and ND Holdco is merged with Merger Sub, with ND Holdco surviving the merger.  Under the merger agreement, the Buyer has agreed to also merge the surviving corporation of the first merger, with an LLC that is wholly-owned by Buyer, which LLC will survive that second merger.  Intended tax consequence - the two mergers, together, are intended to be considered an A-type tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) and Rev. Rul. 2001-46 (often referred to as a “two-step” merger).  So, the Buyer stock received in the mergers would be received by each of you on a tax-deferred basis (i.e. gain/loss is not recognized on that portion until subsequently sold by you).  The cash consideration is typically still taxable in a tax-free reorganization, as capital gains received in the disposition of your shares of ND Holdco, but these gains are also expected to be excludible under QSBS rules.

### --- Ben Wild Compensation ---

-- Normally a hands-off introduction is 4% of the gross revenue of the first 12 months of contract work.
-- In the case of this “city towing” idea, it is pushing us in new strategic directions that seem interesting
In this specific case makes sense to double that to 8% of the first 12 months, 
BUT if we are going to be doing a lot of internal, unpaid R&D then we only want to start paying out money once we have broken even on the internal work we did (we will count using any and all sources of city towing money towards this break even point.  We would keep the amount we owed you on paper until the break even point, and then start paying you as revenue came in.)

Not written to him, but if he talks about equity:
If you are owning some part of a joint business then it would make sense to share equity around that business.  Still as you know, really driving a new business take sweat, so we would want to be in a position where you are ready to throw down some agreed upon, significant chunk of time.
### --- ChipStack ---

REFERRAL FEE -- Some kind of referral fee payment for any business that Shane brings to AF.

SHARED EQUITY -- Some kind of equity sharing for the system built.
(specifically, the ability for either he or AF to “go our separate way” and build from the IP that had been produced.  At least for some period of time.)

KEEP-THE-LIGHTS-ON-SALARY -- Something like 20K/year.  


### Outcult email

Dan,

here a summary of the thinking from our prior call:

- SHOW IT -- The idea that we would use your experience to learn how to drive new buisness for AF is an exciting idea for us in principle, but the real excitement comes when we see that it can move from theory to effective action.  Here are our ideas about how we might do this in a way that is best for all parties:

- LEAD BY YOU -- I am happy to, and need to, give you feedback on your ongoing ideas, so that you don't waste your efforts on somethig that we would not bankroll.  That said, the specific written proposals would come from you, and they would be that basis for action.  we would all get on the same page, then AF would fund the effort, we would see what happened, and decide what to do next.

- MINIMIZE RISK -- As a general principle we would like to set this up in an iterative system that specifically is designed to minimize risk on all sides.  Here are a number of ideas that seem to do this:

- AF PAYS -- In the long run you stand to perhaps land your next gig as part of our team, that could be a big value, but it is too uncertain for you to be risking your money towards that end.  Instead AF will be risking it money, and in return AF should be getting good experimentation per dollar and per founder hours of out of the collaboration no matter what happens.
	Here are some ideas of maximizing value per dollar and per founder hour:

	- USE PHILLIPPINE TEAM -- We have guys that can put up websites, including some graphic designing etc. (if someone provides them the copy).  They can potentially answer emails etc. too, as long as the behavior is precisely specified (e.g. flow charts and templated emails, etc.)
	
	- USE AF DOLLARS FOR ADS -- As long as Nick and Dan are approving already fleshed out ad campaigns, then it seems safe enough to spend AF dollars to run specific experiments.  hopefully then can be iterative, so at each stage we are not approving many many thousands on a test.
	
	- REACTIVE FOUNDER FEEDBACK -- You are the expert on sales strategies, so we can save founder time by allowing you to first propose concrete plans of action, and then I give feedback on how comefortable we are with the path so you are not wasting time fleshing out a dead end.  This can put the ball in your court, while still ensuring that you have a solid feedback single to guide your work.  (we are not too risk averse, as long as our brand is not at risk, we are ok giving a try to a range of things.  The big litmus: first we want to see the concrete detailed plan...)

- PROPOSAL ITERATION -- To save everyones time, we imagine the following process execution:
	- Outcult & Oblinger brainstorm verbally.
	- Outcult proposes one or more "back of the napikin" plans.
	- Oblinger provides early feedback if we would likely fund one or more.
	- Outcult (maybe with spot help from Philippine team) fleshes out the details proposal.
		- It may be possible for Outcult to obtain modest help from the Philippine team for very well specified info searches 
			(not clear how helpful it would be, but it is there.)
		- Oblinger would be on hand to give feedback if there were questions of scope, costs, or strategy... but mostly we would be looking to Outcult for such ideas
	- Detailed proposal is on paper.  This would be all the way down to the actual copy that would be on the landing pages, and the actual copy to be used in the email outreach. etc.  Getting to this concrete proposal would be ALOT of work, but it would make the executing of the proposal much less work, since much of it was preloaded.
	- Once a specific campaign was "locked and loaded" it would be executed according to plan.
		- Quite possible large parts of the plan would be executed by the Phillippine team, at least if Outcult can design it in that way.

	- SMALL SIZING -- Rinse and repeat.  These proposal / execution phases would be iterated, in a way that breaks up the risk taken on my AF for each one of these campaign/experiments, and it also shrinks down the work require by Outcult to get ready for execution.
	
	- PAYMENT -- In addition to paying 100% of the costs for these experiments, AF would pay a nominal salary to Outcult.  
		- Our thinking is something like $1.5K/month for solid part time work.
		- We would select a nominal time frame for executing a proposal, and readying for the next proposal, and that nominal timeframe would imply a dollar figure (at $1.5K/mo).
		- Actual payment would occur as propsal was executed and next proposal was accepted.
		
	- PARALLIZATION -- As this model ramps up, we can easily have multiple project bundled into larger proposals.
	
	- OUTCULT VALUE -- The real value to Outcult is likely the idea that we might hit upon a working recipe, and we transition away from this model towards one where he is more of a partner within the company.  Until that point, this is somehting of a "heavy hobby" for him.  Earning a bit of money, and having interesting resources to play with, but not really "worth it" until we hit upon some kind of repeatable process that he is driving.

### AF Contract Tracking

**PROPOSAL REQUEST** -- We have agreement that AF should be write a proposal.  Immediate actions (<24 hours):
- **DATA GATHER SCHEDULED** -- If data gather meetings are needed they should be scheduled immediately upon proposal request.
- **TIMELINE SET** -- Immediately upon proposal request written timeline detailing owners and dates for proposal.
	(Timeline might only have two lines for PDD / SOW, or might 
	 include data gather steps etc.  Try writing in parallel.
	 Most proposals should be back to client in a week.)
 - **TIMELINE** -- At a minimum the timeline should include: 
	 1. DATA GATHER meeting times
	 2. PDD owner/dates, 
	 3. SOW owner/dates, 
	 4. Presentation meeting owner/date invitation is sent.

**PROPOSAL MEETING** -- Owner of this meeting also owns sheparding proposal upto acceptance.
- Generally want to keep pinging client twice weekly or so to keep proposal moving, and ensure there are no issues.

**ACCEPTANCE** -- Client has agreed to contract terms.
PM owns timeline now.  Immediate action (<24 hours):
- Timeline for contract ramp up is written.  
	(may be a single date, but it is written)
- Work begins

### GDS Emails

Nick:
-- I am sending the bulk of the emails now,
-- I have a big question mark around estee lauder.
   it was a weird meeting, I found little specific to propose,      but they are pretty behind internally, so it felt like they 
   need help.  Big problem is I cannot find my recording of this    interview, so I am really flying blind.  In theory we have a 	meeting scheduled (but it is only on my calendar right now).  	 We could push for an EIP discussion, but I think she is not      the right person to pitch it to.  Maybe the initial pitch...
   anyway I will include my starter email below, do you want to 
   finish that email with some EIP ask?
 -- I wrote some words about power disagregation you can add to an email.

Thanks for taking the time at GDS.  We are sceduled for a 9am

Mr Tuscon Electric.

We did some work modelling earlier this year disaggregating power usage of individual devices in the home, based on very rough instrumentation at the fusebox.  And last year we worked with MICROSYNCOGUYS who have an extremely high resolution power monitoring sensor.  Depending on the data being collected it seem possible one could produce hyper-fine grained power usage models.  It would be interesting to estimate the costs savings that could be obtained if such modelling were used in planning and decision may co-founder to bring in an idea for your engineering team?

They have fancy devices that can get good core samples, they keep direct sales to final customer, and they currently do not do any value add analytics over the data that they deliver.
They are typically brought in by intermediaries for the fancy work



Subject: Value add analytics for your clients
~-~
Kerry,

It was great to connect at GDS.  I really did hope to connect with you more, but didn't get the chance to make it happen!

It’s clear that you have a deep understanding of the data that is available and useful to the prospecting and operations work that is at the heart of exploration. You have this real untapped potential around leveraging data given the direct relationship that you have with the ultimate buyer in each one of these engagements.

There MUST be real upsell potential in the data that you are collecting in each one of these engagements.  I don't see my way clear to the answer yet, but it pains me to see those dollars just laying on the table! 

Also, its clear that your org is lopsided.  Having dozens of geologists and ZERO data scientists on staff just cannot be optimal.  If you get to a spot where you have candidates for that role I would be happy to give you third party assessment of their data science credentials .

My November is pretty much spoken for, but if you have interest in thinking through some of these issues, I would enjoy a brainstorming call first week of december.

Let me know,
Dan

I enjoyed our chat at GDS, and by the way I am a Buckeye!  I would have mentioned it, but didn't look carefully enough at your card when you handed it to me, to see where your based.

I am looking forward to the call you suggested with Keith.  It seems there are analytics that might be done on the supply chain itself, as well as optimization in sales and marketing.  (But if I recall Keith in only focused on supply chain.)

I am on an offsite all week with our team next week, but my schedule opens up starting on Nov 11th.  Is there any day that week which work for a followup call?

Scott, 

Great sitting next to you at GDS.  As I recall from the blur that was the last three days, you were going to check in with your manufacturing partner in Malaysia to see if they were ready to talk about data analytics.

If they are, we are more than happy to have the conversation.
In the mean time I have kept your on-prem cloud one pager.
It gives me enough to of hook to make an introduction if we find a client where this could be relevant.  (I have one in solar that I will run this past now.)

Looking forward to connecting again,

Subj: Finding the analytic value of your data
Daniel,

You guys are in an interesting position, you have gotten the political buy-in to build a large and expensive data lake, but have not had the chance to explore which parts of that data can really be used to drive bottom line value.  The good news is that the data lake money has not been spent yet, so you still have time to learn and direct your vendor towards the cleaning and organizing which is really going to have business impact.

If you recall our approach in these situations:  We like to bite off a small tactical outcome that seems it might have value, build a POC (on our nickel) to see if we can make a bottom line difference in that area.  You mentioned many juicy targets for us to consider.  Segmenting patients to drive drive marketing behavior, modelling differences in radiology consults by location, etc.

If you have an appetite for these kinds of POCs, our next step would be a call to enumerate your best guess on most important targets, that would let us come back with a few proposed approaches.  This really is the kind of homework that should be done before the data lake is complete -- else it will have the wrong shape!

Let me know if you have interest and time for a call to see nail down such a POC.

Cheers, 
Dan

Alan,
Glad that we connected at GDS, seems like this could be a worthwhile side relationship for both of us!  I have our followup call on the Calendar for Dec-3rd at 1pm EST, I will send a zoom meeting invite just so my co-founder can join too.

My thought is that we should just iron out a basic finder's fee, perhaps just a flat percent of all top line revenue generated in the first year or something like that.

It seems your background is pretty perfect for working closely with us, so if this connection is fruitful, there is alot we can do to put more fuel on that fire!  Also I know that your early aims are more about just providing raw data to these dealerships, but it is probably worth a bit the brainstorming to see if there are low hanging analytics that might really boost your value to the dealerships.  I am very happy to have a conversation or two just as a buddy about what might be possible.

Looking forward to the call,

Elizabeth,

Your exploratory mindset, your openness to trying things out quickly in the small, is a great value UPS and just fun to be around!  We have been thinking a bunch about how we might do an open pilot with your team.  It seems the biggest area for innovation is around the day-to-day real-time planning.  We had talked about connecting with one of your operational planners as a way to begin that exploration, but perhaps it makes most sense for us to talk again with you first?  

We have our annual offsite this week (whoo hoo, we are going to Prague), but after Nov 12th my schedule really opens up.  Is there a good day that week or the following for us to chat?

I am really glad that you found the time to meet with me, after your original slot was missed.  

You said that you would be having a conversation with Joseph while travelling, regarding the areas of greatest need where we might do a pilot project.  We talked about doing something supporting the UX group, or maybe a different stand alone project serving the larger company.

I will check in week after next just to see if you have an ideas for us to think about before we meet in SF.  And of course I am looking forward to that meeting Nov 20th!  (Where will you be in SF, I will pick a good place to meet nearby.)

Subj: Moving to SF
Mel,

Great to connect up at GDS.  Glad you caught me in passing so we got connected.  We said we would chat about your move to SF.  I am very happy to do that, I think I need to know a little bit more about you and your background in order to be of most use in thinking about how you might attack this city, and also if I have any contacts that might be relevant.

I am also excited to pick your brain about fraud detection, and generally about how the fin industry works.  We are quite strong in AI, ML, deep learning, NLP, etc. So fin is a natural fit.  Still I don't really have a strong understanding how the industry works, and which levers really matter when approaching new clients.

I think we said we should aim for first week in December for a followup call.  If so feel free to pick a day and time, I am quite open.

Cheers,

Subj:  Getting the gold out of them thar hills

Steve,

Our conversation was really a highlight of the event for me.  Your situation is so unique and so perfect:  You have done the hardest work of just getting data into a unified framework, and have yet to embark significantly on the most fun part of doing the analytics to drive value.

I think the big challenge is going to be narrowing down onto a single area where we build our first POC.  As we mentioned, we like to try to narrow down to some tactical place where we can show concrete value using a basic POC.  *then* we put in a formal proposal for work.  

You said you would chat with several of your stakeholders about what value would matter most to them, and we would have a call in early december.  We should get that call scheduled so it doesn’t slip.  I am also thinking I should just jump on a plane and spend an afternoon having a couple of one-on-ones with a few of your stakeholders.  In a matter of one afternoon I think we could learn a TON about which POCs might be most practical, and most doable in a short timeframe.

Either way, can you do call a wednesday Dec-3rd call in the afternoon?

Cheers, 
Dan

Subj: Visit to Fresno

Munish,

Thanks for the chat at GDS, I learned alot in a few short minutes.  I am looking forward to our road trip to Fresno to see your team!  It seems there are so many different awesome directions to use analytics to provide concrete revenue improvements for OLAM.  I can tell we are at the very beginning of that understanding, so it probably makes sense for this trip to be a basic fact finding mission.  My thought is we arrange a series of short one-on-one conversations with different roles in the company, the aim would be to understand what tactical analysis could be done on your data in order to make the biggest improvement in their current job.  (Just as you did with the average weight optimization with cotton bales.)  On the heels of that we can probably do a little POC on our side before submitting any kind of formal proposal.  That way we have identified concrete value up front before sending anything up the line for approval.

What is a good week for us to go to Fresno?  We could do the second week in December, or skip to the first weeks in Jan as two possibilities.

Really looking forward!

Sundeep,

Our conversation about crazy strategies to model the high frequency trading market was a total blast at GDS...  Thanks for waking me up at the event.  Though you are tempting me to  *actaully* take the idea seriously!  Too many ideas, too little time!  I wanted to checkout your teaching videos, but I cannot recall now the name of the service that you use.  (something ...tutor?)

Would you like to put a call on the books for either the end of this month, or towards the middle of December?  I feel there has to be some good connections between the ML that I do and the way the industry works.  I also had **SO** much fun talking, I think I should not loose touch, just so I can occasionally have conversations like that in my life!

Bray,

It was great to connect at GDS.  I really did hope to connect with you more at GDS, but didn't get the chance to make it happen!

Its clear that you have a deep understanding of the data that is available and useful in the prospecting and operations work that is at the heart of exploration.

I was also thinking also thinking more about just how lopsided your companies current configuration is.  You have this real untapped potentential given the direct relationship that you have with the ultimate buyer in each one of these engagements.

I don't see my way clear to the answer yet, but there MUST be real upsell potential in the data that you are collecting in each one of these engagements.  It pains me to see those dollars just laying on the table!  Its also clear that your org is lopsided.  Having dozens of geologists and ZERO data scienists on staff just cannot be optimal.  If you get to a spot where you have candidates for that role I would be happy to give you third party assessemnt of their data science credentials .

My November is pretty much spoken for, but if you have interest in thinking through some of these issues, I would enjoy a brainstoming call first week of december.

Glad that we connected at GDS, seems like this could be a worthwhile side relationship for both of us!  I have our followup call on the Calendar for Dec-3rd at 1pm EST, I will send a zoom meeting invite just so my co-founder can join too.

My thought is that we should just iron out a basic finder's fee, perhaps just a flat percent of all top line revenue generated in the first year or something like that.

It seems your background is pretty perfect for working closely with us, so if this connection is fruitful, there is alot we can do to put more fuel on that fire!  Also I know that your early aims are more about just providing raw data to these dealerships, but it is probably worth a bit the brainstorming to see if there are low hanging analytics that might really boost your value to the dealerships.  I am very happy to have a conversation or two just as a buddy about what might be possible.

ALEX change healtcare:
I am at AI dev world with you.  If you have a moment for a coffee, I have been thoughts about the intersection of Heath and NLP (I was the DARPA PM that funded IBM's watson tech)

VMWARE
GAURAV:
I am AI dev world with you; looking forward to your talk tomorrow.  My background is PhD ML, and at DARPA I pitched a ML-based cyber defense program.  I would love to grab a coffee if you have a moment today or tomorrow.

Ford
Shounak:
I am at AI dev world with you; Language understanding has been a long time interest (while at DARPA I funded IBM's watson tech).  If you have a few moments it would be great to grab a coffee while we are at the same conference.


AT&T
Alka,
I am at AI dev world with you.  I have been applying ML across networked device (1/2 billion dollars worth).  Love to chat for a few minutes if you have the time here.


Macy,
Mahmood,
I am at AI dev world with you.  I see that you are thinking about how to scale AI experimentation.  I think it is the difference between enabling cost effective execution.  It relates to work I funded at IBM reserach (at the time I was a DARPA PM).  If you have time for a quick coffee it would be great to chat.
 

...my background is PhD ML, as DARPA PM but lately have been applying this across real-time distributed device networks.  Love to grab a coffee if you have the time as this seem related.

### Update to mymgr

TRIP -
LINKS - at bottom

Some feedback:


My idea is we split the coordination work around things like conferences, events and such.
The benefit … if it works is that I am focused on activities that I cannot share with others, and am not spending time focused on the details of these things during the period leading up to them.
But I am very responsive so you are not struggling to understand with too little info.

To make it work it needs to be a background task that is done as soon as new info becomes available, that way we stay in sync, and it main calendar entry has the latest info.
To make it work, I need to be confident that if I am not paying attention, then in the last minute the details will have been considered.

The details are pretty standard:

— TICKETS BOUGHT?

— MEETING POINT LOCATIONS KNOWN?

— BACKUP CONTACT CELL NUMBER?

But I don’t know where I am going right now….  I will figure it out.  But anyway that is the aim of this way of splitting work ….  
I am not clear where my tickets are or where I go to pick them up….   It should be less than 1-2 hours total time to gather relevant info (I think, let me know if that is wrong)


Maybe it cannot work at AF, in this case I can just do it myself, or hire a separate person for this.
I don’t want to make a big deal out of this one function, but I also want to be clear in providing feedback:
   Right now it is not safe for me to ignore the details…. Stuff is going to drop…


So not a big deal, but also not working as it should.

Cheers, 
Dan
### Jayant

Jayant,
Sorry for dropping off the radar after our missed connection before your India trip.  I have a good excuse (see photo of my new son Eli below!)  

I get the sense that priorities might have shifted since we last spoke.  Still I would love to close the loop on the technology we developed identifying in home device usage.  We did some analysis of architectures for customer acquisition pipelines that we should show as well.

Let me know if there is a good day this week or next for us to catch up.

cheers,
Dan
### BRUCE -- H schien
Bruce:

It seems like the NLP chat bot, and war idea move the need on execution efficiency at Henry Schein while the auto-reston idea might really bup top line refenue.as well increase topline revenues.


It seemed in our calls we came to a couple of ideas that could potentially move the needle for Henry Schein.  

Its too early to know for sure, but applying AI to the chat-based workflow interface idea, the "war room" fleet optimization idea, and the vision-based auto-restocking vision idea all seemed strong. 

It seems the right next step if for you and I to have a call and get the bottom of it.  Either there is a "move the needle" actionable project here, or perhaps not.


If that sound right, let me know a few times we might talk,
dan
### Andre Email
Andre,

Glad to hear it.  We will keep that momentum up.
I am glad to have some direction regarding verticals.
We have experience specifically related to smart metering, so we will definitely be able to contribute in that area.

My only question about the vertical is the aim at utililty companies.  In one way they are a gold mine, since they have boat loads of revenue.  But in our experience they are extremely slow, risk-averse, and make decisons based on relationships instead of technology superiority.  So they are tough customers to get contracts with.  What is Josh's thinking on this?

Actually do you mind if I CC you on an email to Josh just to get his thinking about landing that segment of customer?
### James Note

Nick here is my starter lists for team and for business model. I also included the direction I am giving James, just so you see where the deck is going....

Quick question: should I list NLP under AI.  really we have no one to cover this.  we can fake it a bit w. MIT, but it is definitely not their strength nor ours.  still it is a notable gap if I omit it.

James, 
I sent this to Nick and you at the same time, tomorrow he will work on this, so you can check in with him before you start, or you can just begin and then make his edits to both the old and new  versions.  (long term we will keep both portrait and landscape versions)

James, 
I want to create a slide deck based on our portrait pdf.
I know you are quite busy.... this is high priority and I will iterate with you as soon as you return this.  

But use your judgement if you cannot work on it immediately, I understand.

OVERALL DIRECTIONS
--> Slides are put into landscape
--> Maybe we use some kind of slide style or maybe it is just white
--> Here are the slides for the deck (derived from the portrait style deck)




FIRST SLIDE
- AF FLAME with "Analytics Fire" with it.
- Phrases on first slide:
		Boutique Consulting   	(as big text)
		specialized In			(as smaller text)
		Full Stack AI			(as big text)

SECOND SLIDE

Left side
- Picture of Dan, Dan's bio
- Picture of Nick, Nick's bio

Right side 
- Right approach, right tech, right experience
	(Use all the text from the left side of top portrait page.)


SLIDES 3, 4, 5
- These are the three use cases one per slide.


SLIDE SIX
Title:  Enabling Your Business Outcomes
SubTitleText:  (leveraging your data as it exists now)

   {[DIRECTIONS:
	- subtitle text in notably smaller font]}]
	- content for this slide is taken from the bottom half of the first portrait page from the first deck:
		"Leverage your data as it is ...."
	- Still have icons above and below 
	- Remove small text in lower section:  
		forecasting... sales..)
	- Change the icon for scheduling. rotate 90-degrees so schedule looks more like a gantt chart.  make bars thinner and show more structure there. (It needs to look like a gantt chart w/o the word scheduling below it.)
	- Change icon from manufacturing to have two or three internal nodes and a few more external nodes to the graph

SLIDE SEVEN
title:	The Analytics Fire Company

Left side:
- left side title:  The Team

### two emails
Jayant,
Sorry I missed you on Friday.  Congrats on your promotion!  I am sure that is putting you underwater.  Once things settle down if you still have interest in the power disaggregation topic, it would be fun to show it to you.  But either way, it looks like you have good coverage for your current projects based on the team in India so it probably makes sense to first figure out what problems they can handle well, then if there are gaps to consider alteratives. 

Best luck in the new role!
--Dan

Legrand XXXX:

I recall from our conversation earlier this year that your team  was very interested in building intelligence into home/commercial understanding and control.  We just finished a POC where we explored the use of deep learning and marcov process learning in order to do power disaggregation.  That is to figure out which devices are being used within the home.  

What is interesting about this kind of work is that it can be done with a single sensor on the power grid, so it is the kind of thing that might complement your strategy as I understand it.  Very happy to show these results and hear your latest progress in adding intelligence.  

Let me know if you have interest in a call.

--dan


### Mel
Mel,

Happy 2020.  Hope you got some good relaxation in over the holidays.
I would love to have a quick sync call to see if there might be life in any of the conversations you suggested inside Synchrony, if you are thinking at all about the majors out here in the valley, and just hear what your latest thinking is.

Let me know a good time,
--Dan

A frost scholar!  Well I am secretly relieved to hear it.  All I could think is WOW, I could never pull that insight out of one or ten readings of the poem!

As I read the poem with this framing, it seems to me the Frost is simultaenously saying that the path you take DOES change everything.  Yet paradoxically they lay equally before you today.  Meaning that at this moment there is no basis for choosing one over the other.

I am reminded of a crossroad where I precipitously needed to choose between two thesis advisors.  In discussion, one of them told me:  This choice will change literally everything about your career and your life, but you cannot really see any of that now...  so just choose, and then decide that whichever choice you made was the right one.

This entire concept was completely beyond me to execute at the time, or even now?  Indeed I really could not accept its truth; I stared bloodshot in the eyes as far as I could see into the mist, and then FRETTED.    I think I will ask him now if he was intentionally referenceing Frost, his message was so dead on!  ... and he is exactly that kind of guy.

... a Frost scholar as a mentor ...   cool...
### Kyle

Kyle is it possible?  My aim is a verifyable AWS lambda function (perhaps using locked S3 buckets).  I want to allow public verification that an endpoint is running what it claims it is.  Can I email my question in more detail?

ksomers@amazon.com

Kyle,
Thanks so much for letting me write to you!  I waited a bit just to let you have your vacation in peace.  I have read some of your materials online I think you are a good person to ask this question to, and I would also rather not shout my question out on the internet.  This relates to some IP that is not currently protected, so please pardon me if I am a little indirect in my questions.

MY GOAL:
Broadly I am trying to create a lambda end point:
	(1) whose behavior is somehow provably matched to some 
		published spec of its behavior over some defined time interval.
	(2) This verification step is achieved in a way that authorized 	third parties who explictly do not trust the creator of this 	 lambda can verify that its configuration is nonetheless    	precisely as published.


HERE ARE SOME PIECES THAT I THINK I AM ABLE TO USE:

- LOCKED S3 BUCKETS -- as I understand it, one can pay to create an S3 bucket whose contents neither you nor no one else can change, and it will exist with some specific contents for some pre-paid length of time.  Is this right?

- NO LAMBDA LOCK -- Unfortunately the current lambda APIs do not afford anyway to provably remove ones own ability to change the configuration of a lambda.  (i.e. there is an S3 content lock, but there is no equivelant lambda lock).  Correct?

- FULL SPEC TEXT FILE -- One can trivially create a text file that fully specifies all aspects of a lambda endpoint.  I think lambda already has a partial spec like this, but as I understand it, the layer contents and access permissions are not included.  Still one could create an extended form that was all inclusive.  Correct?

- FULL SPEC VALIDATION -- Given that one had such a full spec text file, one could programmatically query the AWS apis to verify that a specific lambda endpoint was configured precisely according to the full spec at that moment in time.

- GUARANTEED TRACABILITY -- In lieu of having a lambda lock, it does seem one is able to use lambda tracing/logging capability to verify that the configuration of a lambda endpoint was configured according to a specific spec, and that it had not been altered over some specific period in the past.  Correct?

- LOG TAMPERING -- Are the logs designed in a way that precludes the adminstrator of the account itself from altering them in a way that makes it look as if the configuration had not been changed even when it had been changed?


I think I may be pushing AWS lambda to a place where it was not really designed to go, still it tantalizingly close to the capabilities needed, so maybe it could be made to work anyway.

Thanks in advance for any help, and apologies if these questions seem to be coming from outer space!  

Thanks,
Dan



- each and every part of that spec was precisely 

- , and assuming one had permissions, one could I would like to fully and precisely specify the behavior of a lambda endpoint based entirely on contents in S3.
- LOCKED BEHAVIOR -- I would like to 
- a single master S3 bucket and several dependent buckets.




BACKGROUND:
- Etherium and other block chain technologies provide a turing complete "contract" language mechanism which has the virtue of the coorectness of its execution guaranteed by a global consensus mechanism.
- You can think of the execution of an etherium contract a bit like a lambda invocation, it is just A MILLION times less cost effective.  Maybe worse than 1M times more costly and slower too.
- But an Etherium contract is visible and guaranteed in a way that a lambda invocation is not.

GOAL:
- ON Build an "off chain" computation substrate using AWS lambda which "borrows" some of the block chain guarantees by being "launched" from a on-chain data.
