- AUTO INSERT -- 
### OBS-PUBLISH
- Auto upload pandoc output to be viewed (potentially with password)

- [ ] OBS:  Change styling of published pages
- [ ] OBS: Publish clean looking web content automatically from markdown

- [ ] BUG:  km recognized the '@sports visio' topic page, but then did not link all people docs in the folder
- [ ] Update kmt so .md will match without num prefix and with/without dunder
- [ ] KMT - scan whole note not just prefix

### HISTORY

- [ ] Add 'history' all changed files by commit    # foo_bar 


### SEND
- [ ] [[OBS.]]:  Fling Active, Wings, Back
- [ ] [[OBS.]]: Fling 's'start 'e'end  1, 2, 3

### OBS Tabular Title
- Each kind of table has an table indicator REGEX
- Each kind of table has title data field REGEX (used to extract title from entry's markdown page)
- Table maintains bidirectional link between table entry and the title field value
- All rows with no indent up to a double blank line are the table entries.
- All text beyond the first @ link is the title of the table entry (it is the synced part)


### Bidirectional sync to gsheets
- [coupler.io](https://blog.coupler.io/python-to-google-sheets/)   has some good ref material for py-bindings
- scan three level hiearchy with direct content or links to next level down
- map key value pairs into a table row
- build URL links to local files
- Format Idea:
	- leading space indicates positional arguments (can be wiki-link, markdown-link, key: value-pair, trimmed string with spaces)
