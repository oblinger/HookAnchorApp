# THE HOOK SYSTEM

THE HOOK SYSTEM - Synchronizing your meat brain with your digital brain.

## HOOKING

### __
- The hook system synchronizes your meat brain with your digital brain by maintains of a set of known *hook names* and associated destinations.
- Careful optimization of the micro-steps required for adding, maintaining, and accessing your digital brain allows one to not break flow.
- Incremental curation of the destinations allows one to ensure hooks are known and destinations can be efficiently navigated.


### intro #1
The hook system is designed for larger-scale, task-driven digital brains.  It assume that information collected should be organized and presented optimally for an evolving set of overlapping work efforts.  Knowledge is not collected for knowledge sake, but rather for using in a progression of specific knowledge-based efforts.  This system is consistent with and syntergistic with Zettleskin, Para and other digital brain paradigms.

But the hook system is hyper focused on micro-efficiencies around, storing information, maintaining information, and retrieving information.  High levels of efficiencies in these facilitate working in-flow that is unbroken by the ones knowledge management system.  Ideally as soon as one has information to add, one already knows where it goes, when a specific bit of information is needed it appears with nearly no effort, and complex knowledge-based tasks are executed with information organized specifically for that task.  The hook system approaches this ideal using a number of interlocking methods and tricks described below; these methods may be adopted in part or in whole.


### Overview - The Hook System

Knowledge work is a process of synthesizing new outputs from prior knowledge.  Critical for this activity is effortless retrieval of specifically remembered personally entered information.  The hook system scales to tens or hundreds of thousands of item while retaining effortless retrieval taking mere seconds. 

A *hook* is a short name that automatically comes to mind when thinking about some "digital destination" (some previously seen screen of information).

The hook system methods incrementally adapt these hooks and destinations facilitate knowledge work in flow state.  The idea is to organize ones digital brain so the most frequent operations are reduced to subconscious muscle memory so ones mind can remain focused of the work at hand, not the digital tool or info organization.  The key ideas of this method are outlined here and described in detail in the subsequent section.

**TWO STEP ACCESS** - Most info operations are begin with a two step access pattern.  
- In step #1 the users thinks of some previously seen screen and remembers the hook name for that destination and after touch typing that name sees that destination.
- In step #2 the user uses the destination "landing page" to navigate to the place for the required action.

Getting this two step access pattern working well allows one to use hundreds or thousands of hooks to rapidly access tens or hundreds of thousands of info items.  This system really scales!  Many initially feel such a two step structure cannot work for their information, I encourage them to dig into the XXXX section, since it many cases this seems to turn out to be incorrect.


**OPEN LOOP ACCESS** - Once a hook name is thought of one should be able to access that bucket entirely via muscle memory, e. g. with touch typing alone.  So no use of mouse or menus, or knowlege about what state the computer is in.  e. g. you can get from any place in any app to the correct bucket with your eyes closed, and no knowledge of your systems state beyond the fact that it is logged in, and your fingers are on the keyboard.  (Open loop access requires several tricks and really an optional "next level" implementation of the hook system.  It still provides significant value simply using the quick switcher for access.



### Hook Destinations

**DESTINATIONS** - A destination can be *ANY* screen that serves as a "launch point" for some range of activity.  So in the broadest implementation of the hook system all of the following are examples of destinations, but to be clear this list in not intended to be exhaustive,:

- EXTERNAL ENTITY HOOKS - Any named, unique entity that exists in the physical world, can have a digital destination that organizes information about that entity
	- PERSON - An info page about an individual.  In my case I have standard
	- CORPORATION - A
	- A BOOK - 

- DOCUMENT HOOK - 
	- LOCAL DOCUMENT (e.g. my resume, a slide deck about this hook system, or a spreadsheet email addressed used at Christmas) - 
	- WEB DOCUMENT - 

- ACTIVITY or AREA MANAGEMENT HOOKS - 
	- AREA PAGE - 
	- PROJECT OVERVIEW PAGE - 
	- PROJECT TODO LIST - 
	- CROSS CUTTING LIST/ORG DESTINATIONS (e.g. My daily or weekly journal page, My global "todo" list, my list of ) - 
	- WORKSPACE - 

- ACCESS/CONTROL INTERFACES
		e. g.  My 2023 Tax documents folder,  Shared dropbox folder for our team's Kellog account, My Apple Mail client, the spotify interface
	- LOCAL FILESYSTEM FOLDER - 
	- CLOUD FOLDER - 
	- LOCAL APP - An app on your local machine (e. g. your mail client)
	- WEB APP - 

As we see, a great range of operational pages and interfaces can serve a hook destination.  Still this list is not intended to be exhaustive, really ANY remembered screen of information or interface could potentially serve as a hooked destination.  The Hook System requires that we artfully evolve and maintain and effective set of hundreds or thousands of these hooked destinations.




### Hook Space Maintenance

We refer to the evolving set of all hook name and associated destinations collectively as *hook space*.  The set of ideas and methods here are key to managing this space:


**INCREMENTALITY** - Rich and complete cross-linking of ones information has many benefits for retrieval and processing.  But it comes at significant time and effort for creation and maintenance.  This cost is especially acute in the common case where one does not know the importance or appropriate organization for information at time of adding.  The hook system optimizes this by capturing 


**UNIFIED NAME SPACE** - (talk about this here)


SHORT NAMING - 


LOCAL / INCREMENTAL - Both the pragmatics of human pyschology, and our focus on optomizing time & effort efficiecy require that (nearly) all maintaince operations required by the hook system are incremental and "on the fly" in nature.  So mis-remembering a hook name is an opportunity to add another alias or rename a destination.  Landing on the wrong hook is an opportunity for merging/refactoring two hooks, or adding a links between them, etc.

ALIASING - 


DATING - 
way to keeping namespace clean.

REIFICATION - Much of our info space was initially captured as a side effect of some other activity at a time when the ultimate placement and importance of that knowldege was not understood, and at a time when it would not have been convenient to stop of consider how to be organize the new info.  Often such info is jammed into a dated meeting or note entry connected with the hook page for some existing activity.  If that info is needed in the future it can be accessed from within the relevant meeting note.  If this occurs often enough, or if that information is further refined after that meeting, then it is copied to its own note, within an appropriate hook page, or potentially with its own hook name.  Over time richer and richer linking can be added directly to this page.  What is key from the very beginning is that the information is in a location that it is two step retrievable at least for a period of months.  (If it is never further accessed for many months, and thus never reified, then it is acceptable if it requires full text search or other very generic methods of retrieval)


#### Facet-ization

Many hooks may have multiple of the destination types listed above for a single hook. Imagine your team is working on a quarterly report, you might have a local folder for your contributions, a dropbox folder for the group, a working copy as a google doc, a trello board tracking your teams progress, and local text file where you keep a log of notes from your team meetings.   The generalized way of handling this situation is to have a single landing page associated with the "Qreport" hook, and that page links to each of these destinations.  This works well, but is a bit cumbersome since one must manually create and maintain this dispatching page for every such group of facets.

Often these facets fall into a couple of highly repeated types.  For these we can further optimize their implementation.  Below is a list of facet names that I use in my digital brain to provide direct access to these many facets of a single hook name.  So using my facets, the above destinations could be directly accessed by first typing "q-r-e-p-o-r-t" without hitting return.  Then a list of all facets for this hook are shown and then a single prefix letter can be used to select the appropriate destination.  Then hitting:
- F - return	will show my local folder in the mac finder to I can add, remove, or operate on files there.
- B - return	will show our shrared drop BOX account 
- .  - return	will show the obsidian note with my personal Todo entries for this project.  (I track tasks at a very fine grained level here, and at a course grain level for the team)
- 
-  return  		will go to the default destination (which could be any of the other facets listed below).  For example "s-p-o-t-return" launches my local spotify app on my machine, while "s-p-o-t-1-return" will use 1-password to log into my web account for spotify.
In the case that facets fall into repeated 

ASPECT NAMING - For each entity we might think of there often are distinct forms of information associated with it.  Often a bucket with have a folder in the filesystem associated, maybe a key document, or website with password

## Implementing The Hook System in Obsidian

Over the last 20 years I have implemented variants of the hook system across 4 or 5 different info management systems.  The details have varied, but much of the core functionality has one way or another (eventually) been added to each.  Here are the details of my implementation in Obsidian on a Mac.  I am pretty darn happy with the system in this context.  Much of my happiness stems from my ability get fine-tuned flexible control of the keyboard, and just the raw power of obsidian itself (text folding, intelligent note renaming/merging, etc.)  Here are the pieces of my implementation on Obsidian:




### Open Loop Access
With eyes closed, and using only muscle memory I can navigate to any of the thousand of digital places by simply thinking of it!  No messing around logging in, starting browsers, figuring out where windows and tabs are, what state my current app is in, or access method is best used.  If you are a touch typist, just think it and you are there!

The reader might see this detail as a small improvement 



#### Community Plugin - Another Quick Switcher


#### Keyboard Maestro 


#### Karabiner

The Mac Karabiner App provides the coup-de-grace, a globally available, single-stroke, home-row-key launcher for all my thousands of destinations in hookspace.

BUCKETING - With effort it is possible to define and evolving collection of mental rules for prioritizing information into buckets such that at any given time it is clear which bucket has priority over any given piece of information.  This takes care and maintenance, still with tricks listed below it is very possible, and it completely changes the nature of adding or retrieving information. 

HOOKING - Of course knowing the existence of a bucket is not enough, with nearly no cognitive effort one needs to be able to retrieve the correct bucket from many hundreds or thousands of them.  Hooking is a method of maintaining a unified space of bucket names and abbreviations that evolve and remain synchronized with how one meat-brain is organizing this same information.

HOOKING BASICS
The aim of hooking is to maintain a set of unique short names for all of your hundreds or thousands of buckets without needing to spend much effort in memorizing or remembering these hook names.  This is done using a number of tricks outlined here:


### THE HOOK SYSTEM'S SOLUTION

Ideally one need only think some particular screen of information, and with no conscious effort that information soon appears.

A key part of flow maintained by the hook system is reducing bucket access to an entirely muscle memory process where one simply thinks of a needed bucket and no further conscious thought is require to have the bucket appear.  A number of ideas come together to achieve this:

KNOWN NAMES - In order to not break flow once a needed bucket is brought to mind, the hook name for that bucket must also come to mind at the same time, such that thinking of a particular bucket is tantamount to thinking of the name or abbreviation you are currently using for that bucket.  (See naming tricks for how these are accomplished.)

UNIFIED NAMESPACE -  Further to keep flow it is important that no other information beyond that name itself is needed for retrieval, thus all such names must be unique across a unified space of names and abbreviations. 


NAMING TRICKS

EXTRINSIC NAMING - For entities that exist in the world outside of our own mind there are often agree upon names for these entities.  So people have full names, book have titles, organizations and corporations are names and abbreviations, etc.  When these exist and are know, they serve as natural hook phrases.  


### Older Notes
~~

The hook system addresses issues that crop up as ones digital brain grows in size, it is synergistic consistent with zettleskin, para other digital brain system
The hook system has three over arching objectives:
1. IMMEDIATE - To ensure information can be retrieved via a definite path with minimal or no searching.
2. SUSTAINABLE - To minimize the mental and keystroke effort required to add and maintain information.
3. TASK APPROPRIATE - 
Your meat-brain is already organized around thousands of well defined entities:  the proposed design for J&J, the term paper for LIT203,  your mother, Bob's spicy chili recipe, etc.

KEY ASPECTS

- DIRECTLY ACCESSED - Ability to retrieve info a seconds w/o searching
	- UNIFIED NAME SPACE - 
	- TWO STEP RETRIEVAL -
	- OPEN LOOP ACTIONS -
	- UNIQUE
		- TYPED
		- DATED - 
- MAINTAINABLE - 
	- INCREMENTAL - 
	- LOCAL - 
	- NON-DEGRADING -
