We are a tight team of experts across all areas: PhD propellor heads in computer vision, across to long time ballers in the industry.  We are looking for a passionate Principal Software Engineer/ Software Architect with 8+ years of hands-on experience architecting and building world-class APIs and databases to join our crew.  Could that be you?

Work with the leadership team to develop and execute the company’s technical and business strategy.
Perform technical due diligence and architectural assessments of third-party technologies and solutions.
Experiment and test ideas, validate assumptions against needs, reach conclusions and recommend solutions.
Document standards, best practices, and engineering artifacts so others can easily understand, build, and maintain best-in-class software systems.
Debug the critical problems which arise in production and execute effective solutions within the application and across multiple applications/systems.
Lead continuous learning and process improvement activities to improve the design and overall engineering practices.
Grow talent by participating in hiring and mentoring team members.
Ability to identify missing or ambiguous requirements. Ability to design at high and low levels of abstraction, understand complex requirements, and translate them into understandable solutions. Ability to accurately estimate based on requirements.
Understand the rationale behind and how changes impact the enterprise, applications, and the technical/business ecosystem.
Requirements:

TechHunting:
At Sports Visio we are an AI-tech company applying recent advances in computer vision to the problem of automatically computing stats for basketball directly from video.  Our complete solution requires full stack talent in both web and mobile.  Our team is largely based in South America / Argentina and so we hope to continue hiring in this region.  We are having difficulty sourcing a few key roles and are reaching out to see if helping us land such talent is something you might be able to help with.

We have a team of about 15 devs and would like to use the hiring of our backend architect as a first case for us to explore together.  We have a detailed job ad that we can share, but it would be nice to have a quick summary regarding how you operate as a starting point.  Just a few sentences about pricing and business model / process is helpful.  We can also have a quick call to clarify our need if that turns out to be something we should pursue.  I am very happy to hear back from you, but I would request that you not add my email to any mailing lists.

Looking forward to hearing more!
