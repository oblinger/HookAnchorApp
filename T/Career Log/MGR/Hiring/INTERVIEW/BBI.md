## METHOD: Behavioral-Based Interviewing

Behavior-based interviewing is a technique used in which the job candidate has the opportunity to demonstrate their potential for succeeding in the new job by providing specific examples of how they handled similar situations based on their past experience.

The main difference between this type of interviewing and a regular interview is that rather than merely sharing your opinions or ideas about what you would do in a situation, as in a regular interview, in a behavior-based interview you must describe, in detail, how you handled a situation in the past.

**How it works:**
Behavioral interviewing focuses on a candidate’s past experiences by asking candidates to provide specific examples of how they have demonstrated certain behaviors, knowledge, skills, and abilities. The interviewer evaluates their past behavior to predict how the candidate will perform in the future.

But even in behavioral interviews, candidates should be prepared to answer different types of questions. [Behavioral interviewing questions](https://www.ddiworld.com/blog/behavioral-interviewing-questions) differ from situational questions:

- **Behavioral** interview questions deal with the **past** or **present**. ( See [here](https://hr.uw.edu/talent/hiring-process/interviewing/behavioral-competency-based-interviewing/) some examples provided by the university of Washington)
- **Situational** interview questions deal with the **future**.

**How does the Interviewer prepare for a Behavior-Based Interview (BBI)?**

Interviewers are trained in behavior-based interviewing.  An interviewer will first determine what competencies are required for the position and then develop a series of questions that will allow him or her to find out if you, the job candidate, possess the necessary competencies to perform the job.

Some examples of BBI questions for three competencies are provided below:
- Teamwork: Tell me about a time when you worked with a team to solve a problem. What was the situation? How were you involved? What steps did you take? What was the outcome?
- Decision Making: What was the most difficult decision you have made in the last six months? What was the situation? What made it difficult? What did you decide? What was the result?
- Communication: Describe for me when you had great difficulty communicating your thoughts clearly to another person or group. What was the situation?  Where did the difficulty in communicating effectively lie? What did you do to get your point across more clearly? What was the outcome?
