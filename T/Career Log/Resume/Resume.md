Larger exploratory DARPA efforts (1⁄2 to 5 million dollars)
1. **Attacking Time** – Pervasive, OS-level variability, inoculates systems against any fixed virus/worm.   (I am assuming ML-like adaptation, not sure that is right)
2. **Möbius** – Self-organizing ontology acquisition system.
3. **ML on Multi-core Architectures** – Develop primitives supporting algorithms in a shared-memory context.
4. **Never Ending Learning** – Statistical “triangulation” to uncover latent world knowledge underling web data.
5. **Enhanced Bootstrapping** – Precursor to BL program, developed self-extensible representations of procedural & declarative knowledge.
6. **Textual Corpora Assessments Protocols** – Intellectual cross fertilization in field of text processing gated by availability of strong, quantitative, comparative measures.
7. **Transfer Learning for Adaptive Information Extraction** – Series of efforts to transition base TL technology to self-adapting info extractors spanning, language task and genre.
8. XXX Game World – US lags developed world in science education. Studies show computer games retain attention, but don’t teach. Effort enables game/scenario writers to compete on game’s teaching performance.
9. **Latent Information in Folksonomies** – Extracting latent structure in user content tags. (e.g. flickr / delicious)
10. **Universal Self-Supervised Hierarchical Learning** – Adaptive algorithms driven by spectrum of novel feedback signals (e.g. curiosity, drive to control, drive to mimic, etc.)

##### . notes

- Lead the development of the software for the Aeolus Eldercare Assistance Robot, and delivered this widely noted prototype for presentation at CES.  (Prototype is also the basis for an ongoing relationship with a largest keretsu in Japan, where it is in service in their elder care facilities.)
- Created and lead the hiring team which in turn hired 60 engineers out of over 15,000 applicants (most within a 9 month window).  We hired over 40 with PhDs, many in very targeted sub-disciplines: robotics (grasping, haptic control, etc.), vision (skeletal tracking, high frame rate feature tracking, etc), machine learning (deep learning).
- Established an Aeolus research group within a world-leading grasping research center in Vienna.
- Helped secure $10M in funding from Jafco among other leading investors.

JEOPARDY

IBM applied the MR tech to reading and structuring humanity's 


•	Just under quarter billion, created, sold, and executed
−	Won and defended just under a quarter of a billion dollars in program funding
−	100% success in obtaining authorization for new, and 100% success in defense of existing efforts.  Notable given that the success rate in creating new programs, and defense of their budget over their lifetime both are about 50-50, and this 100% success is over a dozen Director office presentations
•	Larger initiaves (> 50 million) entirely managed by self  (created, sold, and executed)
•	Smaller or inherited efforts:
−	Transfer Learning
−	Information Extraction  (Singapore)
−	Universal Self supervised induction
−	AI & multicore
−	Game world
−	Folksonomy
−	BL seedling?
−	MR seedling name?
−	Mobius name? 
•	Won funding (AR)
•	DARPA Tech IPTO booth
•	DARPA Tech 07 3rd place speaker award
•	Winner IPTO PM Seedling competition
•	Workshops
−	BL RFI
−	MR RFI
−	Industry days
•	Shaping half of the IPTO strategy
−	IPTO SAG   ?STRATEGIC? ADVISORY GROUP
−	Strategy document
−	Budgetary wedge for 

OFFICIAL PROGRAM NAMES
PROGRAMS:  Transfer Learning, Bootstrapped Learning, Machine Reading
SEEDLINGS:  Never Ending Learning, Attacking Time, Enhanced Bootstrapping, Machine Learning on Multicore Architectures, Construction of Textual Corpora and Protocols for Assessments Seedling, Transfer Learning for Adaptive Information Extraction, Transfer Learning for Adaptive Relation Extraction

SBIR:
GameWorld       (5 Phase 1 and 2 Phase 2)
Exposing Latent Information in Folksonomies for Reasoning  (7 Phase 1 [and eventually 2 Phase 2, but none yet])
 STTRs:
Universal Self-Supervising Hierarchical Learning  (1 Phase 1 and –probably – 1 Phase 2)
Next-Generation Behavior Composer for Military Simulation (1 Phase 2)


Number of dollars and people managed
MR: $25M/yr for 5 years.	3 teams.  $8M/prime.  13 profs.
BL: $15M/yr for 3 years.	2 teams + BlueTeam 
TL:	$18M/yr for 3 years.	3 teams.  ($6M per team is a guess, remember it)


$4m internal.  $300K/person = 12heads
$4m / 12profs per prime = $300K per prof.
      4 people = 10% one prof.  1-postdoc.  2-grads

MR Prime = 12 + 48 = 60people x 3 primes = 180heads for MR
BL Prime = 50heads (little smaller). 20 on Blue = 120heads for BL

I was managing ~300 heads when both BL and MR were executing.

	abstract = {Abstract. We present a novel approach to learning predictive sequential models, called similarity-based alignment and generalization, which incorporates in the induction process a specific form of domain knowledge derived from a similarity metric of the points in the input space. When applied to Hidden Markov Models, our framework yields a new class of learning algorithms called SimAlignGen. We discuss the application of our approach to the problem of programming by demonstration–the problem of learning a procedural model of a user’s behavior by observing the interaction an application GUI. We describe in detail the SimIOHMM, a specific instance of SimAlignGen that extends the known Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM). We use the SimIOHMM in empirical evaluations that demonstrates the dependence of the prediction accuracy on the introduced similarity bias, as well as the computational gains over the IOHMM. 1},

### JOE AUGENBRAUN
  
Dan was one of my co-founders at Martian Robots.  I worked closely with Dan in the intense, exhilarating, dynamic, and often frustrating world of doing a startup together.  Dan was CTO and I was CEO.  
  
Let me start with Dan’s technical capabilities – they're top-notch.  He’s smart, clever (those are different things), knowledgeable, and detail-oriented while being able to keep the big picture in mind at all times.  He has an impressive combination of hands-on and theoretical knowledge across a wide range of AI and robotics topics.  His ability to understand deep academic papers in almost any engineering field and apply the learning to practical problems is the sort of secret weapon that every company wants but few have.  
  
He rolled up his sleeves and did work personally to help construct our robot prototype needed for fundraising and then built and ran a high-performance engineering team that spanned the globe.  He has a methodology and a machine for hiring top-notch people and has the personal skills to build them into an organization that delivers.  His enthusiasm and drive created a culture of fast pace, individual autonomy, and deep respect for every individual in his team and in the organization.  
  
Dan isn’t just good at technology.  As CTO he helped figure out the business with me.  He has a good business sense and is an excellent communicator and was great with investors.  
  
I loved working with Dan and would work with him again in a heartbeat.  He has the highest integrity and even when times were tough (they always are at some point in a startup) he was loyal and constructive.  We formed a great friendship and in our business a great partnership.

	Machine Learning/AI/Robotics researcher turned Silicon Valley technology leader---sheparding latest technologies from the ivory tower into your living room.

	I have had the priveledge of working with and leading world class scientists and entreprenures on each stage of the technological journey from ivory tower to your living room.

	Dan began as a machine learning researcher at IBM and teacher at Columbia.  He is published in tier 1 conferences/journals, authored over a dozen ML related patents, and advanced the field of programming by demonstration with a novel integration of ML.

	As a DARPA PM, he transitioned into leadership where he synthesized the research agendas of hundreds of the world leaders in ML, AI, and Natural Languing Processing (NLP) into an agenda helped drive the entire NLP field towards its ever deepening connection with statstical ML.  IBM's Jeopardy-winning Watson technology is outcome of this field-changing work.

	Next he transitioned towards productization and commercialization through a series of technical leadership roles in Silicon Valley.  He has scaled multiple organizations that have delivered technologically advanced prototypes in both Robotics and Clean energy.

I SPENT CAREER
I have spent my career sheparding AI innovation from the very edges of what we understand today all the way into the productization and operational deployment of billions in assets.

~-~-~
PROUDEST
As an individual contributor I am proudest of my theoretical ML work as published in SODA, my algorithic work where we developed a new framework for Programming By Demonstration that interleves user script editing with user demonstrations.
In scaling the field itself I am proudest of the Machine Reading program at DARPA with the legacy impact of statistical learning and NLP that we see today.
In productization I am proudest of the dexterous robotic work at Aeolus, and the innovative new sales channel we developed for auto-designing solar installations propelling that customer to the leader in their industry.

~-~~
QUOTE
Those who see most clearly into the foggy edge of human knowlege will be the titans of tomorrow.    (see most clearly; see most deeply; peer most deeply)

The titans of tomorrow are those who can peer most deeply into fog at the edge of human understand today.

~-~-~
I AM MOST AT HOME
In highly technical roles that leverge and extend my knowlege in AI while also leverage and extend my ability to have impact through leadership

I am most at home having one foot firmly in the highly technical fog of what is now becoming possible in AI and the other foot within or leading a organization focused on driving that change into commercial impact.

	home boy is a braggin.
	

	




	I am doing an extended bio for NKU   (No knowlege U).  my undergrad alma matter. 

	The kentucky boy makes good story will be bolstered by facts regarding the WMR program. 


	How many class rooms, schools, disctricts, and states, were involved in the project?/How many are still involved? /What is the reach of the ESL arm of the project?   number of programs etc. 

	9 states. 
	 Development --- mostly testing and language model data collection -- took place in New   York, Philadelphia, Texas, Kentucky --- I'm not making that up either ---, Utah, Oregon, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Georgia.  It is still being used in the two school districts where it was piloted, Philadelphia and Houston. In Houston it sees daily use in around 100 schools where it has become a fixture in the bilingual education program.  There has been at least one UT-Austin masters thesis on its efficacy in helping ESL kids learn to read in English.  

	It was evaluated by Prof. Susan Williams, then of Vanderbilt, now of UT-Austin,  who found that for measures of a) immediate word recognition skill gain, b) engagement, and c) comprehension it worked significantly better than simply reading a book. She measured dozens of first graders at the beginning of school and the end with half using the standard book treatment and half using WMR.  (Members who used WMR in the fall tested with a book in the spring and vice versa).  One of the most powerful partsof the environment involves the rich information set provided to the teachers. Moreover, because the cost of collecting that detailed level of information is so low, more teachers get engaged at a level that they usually cannot afford.  The reports also link instruction in the classroom with parents who can help with practice at home because they can be given information about exactly what to practice.  By the way, all the reporting stuff was created by the incomparably brilliant Dr. Daniel Oblinger.

	It was the first speech enabled reading tutor to create and use a speech model made specifically for primary grade children. 

	Here's a write-up someone created:

	Watch Me! Read software uses speech recognition technology to help an emerging reader
	(ages 4-8) read an on-screen book and create a multimedia performance of the book
	featuring the child's voice and video commentary. Although the recognition accuracy of
	this technology in actual classrooms is still being evaluated, it offers great promise for
	providing frequent formative assessments of children's reading.

	Speech recognition for adults has been widely available for some time, but similar,
	commercially available systems based on children's voices and vocabulary did not exist.
	This was due, in part, to the lack of appropriate acoustic models for children's voices.
	Recently, researchers at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center have developed the
	necessary models based on speech samples collected from over 1800 linguistically
	diverse children at 20 sites across the U.S. Despite this breakthrough, there are still
	numerous challenges for software developers using speech recognition for reading
	instruction. These challenges include: -- creation of an interface simple enough to be
	navigated by a young children without diminishing the experience of reading -- design of
	technology that tracks a child's progress through the text despite numerous pauses,
	omissions, repetitions, insertions, and mispronunciations -- improved recognition of
	alternate forms of pronunciation common in regional dialects and of children's speech at
	varying stages of maturation -- creation of appropriate feedback for situations in which
	the system can't be certain of the correctness of the child's performance.

	Watch Me! Read is designed to overcome these problems in order to provide independent
	oral reading practice opportunities for young children. Development and refinement of
	the system has been guided by testing in several public school classrooms. These pilots
	have resulted in improved recognition of commonly mistaken words and the creation of a
	diagnostic tool that provides formative assessments of individual student's reading
	performance. Members of Vanderbilt's Learning Technology are currently collaborating
	with IBM's Watson Research Center to evaluate a system-wide implementation of Watch
	Me! Read in the Houston public school system.

#### ACCOMPLISHMENTS

	TRACER

	•	Developed the semantics, designed and implemented a data-directed control flow mechanism as a research associate at OSU.  The mechanism drives part of the AI toolset upon which many AI applications have been written.

	•	Designed and implemented a frame based object oriented language for home automation.  HAL (Home Automation Language) uses a message sending mechanism which is a generalization of Smalltalk's message send.  All knowledge in the system is embedded in a virtual frame database derived from Minsky's frames.  The constructs of the language are defined using a restricted form of attribute grammars (for efficiency).  Even these attribute grammars are contained within the database to allow easy extension/modification of the language.  I have been designing/redesigning this language for over 4 years.  On top of this language I have built programs which utilize a speech synthesizer, A to D converter, touch-tone phone decoder, and many TTL \& relay lines.  All of which I have built and added to my PC-AT.

	•	Designed and implemented task synchronization primitives as a software engineer for IBM.  Primitives are to be used for more than five languages on the IBM 370.

	•	Composed a document to be used as part of a users manual for the above synchronization primitives.  Also wrote a second document which contains an informal proof that the primitives perform according to specification in a multitasking/multiprocessor environment. 

	•	Drafted proposal for, designed, implemented, and tested a text processing environment for the handicapped which is still in use.  Environment included an extensive programmable full screen editor, a note-indexing facility, and an automatic dictionary which interactively completes word being typed.  System is designed to minimize keystrokes.

	•	Implemented XINU, a multi-tasking networking operating system written on a bare IBM-PC.

	•	Designed and implemented a dialect of {\em LISP} in 6809 assembler.  The interpreter uses a shallow binding scheme and has fifty-five primitives most of which are list manipulation or control flow primitives including:  CATCH/THROW/ UNWIND-PROTECT, error trapping, and a non-local GO that can change the context in effect.

	•	Implemented a recursive-descent compiler for a statically-scoped language similar to PASCAL.

	•	Research Paper (unpub) ``Knowledge Representations Used In Learning.''

	Worked with faculty to expand undergraduate Computer Science curriculum to include a class on Automata Theory and Formal Languages.
#### AWARDS AND ACTIVITIES
	•	Graduated Suma Cum Laude.

	Daniel Oblinger and Gerald DeJong, Dynamic-bias Induction 

	A tradeoff exists between the range of learning tasks solved by an induction system, and its performance
	on those tasks. We propose dynamic-bias induction, an approach in which bias is dynamically constructed
	as a function of the learning task. This admits the possibility of a high performance inductive learner that
	applies to a wide range of learning tasks. We assess the benefits and limitations of dynamic-bias induction
	by comparing an implementation of the approach to two existing inductive learning systems. 


	Current explanation-based learning systems acquire plans using a model of the world that is assumed to
	be perfect. Such systems perform well in executing these acquired plans in their perfect simulated world,
	but encounter difficulties in the real world. This is because current systems implicitly assume their model to
	be correct when it is actually impossible to model the real world perfectly. Our approach, embodied in the
	GRASPER system, is to make explicit approximations that the system can refine when failures are
	encountered. GRASPER makes use of its explicit approximation capability to represent uncertainties about
	objects in the world. This enables it to acquire plans capable of functioning in spite of uncertainties.
