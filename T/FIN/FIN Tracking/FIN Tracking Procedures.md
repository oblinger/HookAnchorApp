## Steps for Understanding Spending

### FLOW ANALYSIS
#### ACCOUNT TRENDS - On Schwab View Grand, Sporadic, and Monthly Trends
- Monthly should remain pretty even
- Sporadic should swing by +/- 6K annually (high in May, low in Nov)
- Grand Central should be steady up by some amount

#### COMPARE WITH BUDGET
- Travel, Sporadic
- CARDS: Stuff, Groc, Dan, QL, Dining, Util

### Grand Central Analysis
- WEBSITE - Log into Schwab and look at the Grand Central trend line
- GRAND DELTA - From 'Test' sheet should match this
- INCOME - Check that incomes are correct

### Sporadic
- [[2025 Sporadic Spending.xlsx]] - See if our balance is low or high
- TRAVEL & SPORADIC - Are these matching expected burn rates


## Tracking Monthly Cash Flows
