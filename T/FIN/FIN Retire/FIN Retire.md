## Assets



### Targeted Savings

- Fidelity's guideline: Aim to save **at least 1x your salary by 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, 8x by 60, and 10x by 67**.
- T-Rowe Price:  the more you make, the less SS helps so the bigger ratio you need:  We estimated that most people age 65 
  should aim for assets totaling between 7½ and 13½ times their preretirement gross income.
