### 2024-05-29  ADVICE FROM ADVISORS - Four Levels of Advice

**  

Four Levels of Possible Advice  
  

1. “Forever” Advice - No tied to specific market this year, general advice about how to structure stuff.  
    ⇒ DO: YES - We need this, multiple places can give us this advice.  Expect one time payment.  
      
    
2. “Macro” Advice – This is general market advice about broad risk reward tradeoffs for periods of months/years in the market.  
    E. g. When the yield curve inverted one can shift risk exposure for a period.  
    ⇒ DO: YES I THINK MAYBE – If anything can be predicted over time, it seems this level is most likely, so I am open to this level of advising, and if I were to be actively shifting our money, it would be at this level that I would operate.  
      
    
3. “Micro” Advice – This is the individual stock picking and trading that active trading that funds do over time.   
    ⇒ DO: I DON’T KNOW – I have not found any funds that I felt particularly good about their ability to out-perform the market.  
    If one of them could do it, I would expect that  
    (1) they are not too big since that makes it hard to trade efficiently  
    (2) they are operating in parts of the market that tends to be less efficient (like international or small cap)  
    (3) they are part of a long term outfit with long running funds (else their good results are just good luck and wont hold)  
    (4) have some kind of deep methodology for analysis of stocks, else how are they able to really know what the market does not.)  
    (5) have a relatively low expense ratio.  If they can be better, it wont be lot better than the market, so we cannot lose all that advantage from big fees.  
    ⇒ If we found such funds I would be open to using them.  But I dont’ know of them.  
      
    
4. Stock Advice – Getting advice on purchasing individual securities and such.  
    ⇒ DO:  I am not interested at this level.  I personally don’t have time to investigate and track properly, so I wont mess w/ it.  
      
    

  
  

My focus is on Level-1 and Level-2 advice, this  is why I was looking more at Facet, since they are the cheapest way to get level 2 advice – and it seemed it might be good level 2 advice (maybe).

BUT, if you only believe in level 1 advice, then maybe you don’t care.  Or if you really want level 3 advice, then you would want to avoid Facet since they don’t work well with actively managed mutual funds.

  

Still I am not totally sold on Facet either….

### 2024-03-03  Follow On Questions

  
  

  

ANSWERS:

  

  

****==> Are you and Qingling currently making contributions to your retirement plans. If so, how much and how much are you receiving as a company match?****

  

None from me.  QL is saving approximately 6% of her income into her 401K. 

  

  

****==> What is your monthly principal and interest  payment, interest rate and years remaining on the loan.****

  

House:

$1,063,159 principle

$4,527 / mo payment

2.625% rate   (yay!)

Remaining term. 27years 6mo (fixed)

  

Taxes:

$10,200 twice per year

  

  

  

****==> If you decide to send your daughter to a private school – how much will the cost be per year and will this continue K-12?****

  

(its our son Eli :-) )

  

Private School will be

- $42K/yr tuition + $5K/yr afterschool+food

- We should probably assume K-12, most people don't switch, but we have considered switching part way too.

  

  

****==> Would you like to have savings for private college as well ?****

Yes, we also want to save for college... enough for the 4-year tuition at a good in-state public school.  

Perhaps $60K in today's dollars, though I bet we will want to have a bit more... maybe $100K.  

  

(FYI, we have $25K saved now).  

  

  

****==> You have Qingling’s 401K at 250K with ownership as ‘mixed’. Should only part of this value be included in your retirement plan ?****

- Her 401K has money from before we are married and now money after marriage too.

- My Schwab account has money from before marriage and the sale of my company which was mostly built before marriage as well as money from after marriage too.

  

It’s fine with us if you want to break out our retirement individually as well, but our main focus is understanding if we have enough total for both of our retirements.  

  

The idea is that I retire earlier, and start drawing on my retirement savings, then later QL does the same when she retires.

  

  

****==> We are assuming your 1.6 MM Vanguard account is your 401K or IRA – please confirm.****

- it is a mix of Roth IRA, Regular IRA, and a taxable brokerage account.

- Collectively I am thinking of this as my retirement account.  Though in the past I had drawn on this to pay bills when I was not making enough money while doing startups.  For now the assumption is that I would (mostly) be making enough to not draw on this until retirement.  But startups happen, so modest drawdown is still possible.

  

  

****==> Where are your Google / Waymo etc. stocks held ? We are assuming this is separate from your 400K joint account at Schwab.****

  

- Google in QL's Schwab brokerage

- Waymo and 1-password stock's are held at Shareworks (by Morgan Stanley)

-          We added all your cash to the preferred deposit program with daily liquidity and paying 2.69% now. When you make investment decisions, we can liquidate out of the program the and use the cash to invest the same day.
-          We looked at CD s and will keep you apprised of our CD as well as T-Bill yields. The current CD rate chart is attached.
-          We have sent you a Merrill accredited investor acknowledgement form to e-sign.
-          We discussed positioning your portfolio more defensively for the coming quarters or even years. In this effort, you will use ‘my financial picture’ inside your [ml.com](http://ml.com/) login to link your outside assets. We can then see your overall asset allocation and recommend changes. 
-          I have attached profiles of couple of value portfolios that we use for our clients and which  focus on dividends. We don’t have Q3 reports yet but their Q2 numbers will give you an idea of how they performed in a down market. The net numbers assume the highest fees that we can charge. Please look at the gross numbers and keep in mind that your fees will be around 1%.
-          You are interested in non-correlated alternative investments like private equity and real estate investment trusts. We have started your qualification process and will be able to send you information on open offers after  you are approved in our system.

============


Connie,

I have not heard anything back regarding my final pay.  As I understand it, you have 
taken this over from Fantine.  Here is my accounting of my pay and of the remaining funds
to be paid.

I have added up all of my "non-standard" paid days.  (Those days that are not part of a month at full pay.)
I also added up the two non-standard payments that Aeolus made to me, and show the difference.

The four non-standard pay periods are:
  $15,872  the first 4 days I worked at aeolus
  $65,217  the 18 days in may that I worked as full pay (before Alex lowered all executive compensation)
   $9,057  the remaining 5 days in May working at 1/2 pay
  $41,666  the entire month of June working at 1/2 pay.

The difference between this total $131,812 and $99,205 is what I believe Aeolus still owes me.
Let me know if you agree with this calculation.

(I also included the full history of all payments at the bottom of this email as well for reference)



Pay Delta

 $15,872  4 of 21 days during Oct 2016 @ $83,333/mo
 $65,217  18 of 23 days during May 2018 @ $83,333/mo
 $ 9,057  5 of 23 days during May 2018 @ $41,666.5/mo
 $41,666  Month of June 2018

July 6th
It's shocked to hear your resignation recently and today we've remitted the 
salary of June and 4-days salary in 2016 Oct but I caculated it wrong. 
The correct amount should be 55,456 (83,333*4/21+ 83,333*0.5*19/20) 
and I remitted 57,539. Would you please remit 2,083 back to Aeolus HK 
after your receiving?

SOME MISC NOTES:
There are $11,365.69 in owner cell phone bills from 2015-01-01 to 2018-04-30. These are for both Nick & Dan. I did not have time to review the bills to determine how much went to each person.
There were New Dawn Analytics Inc. business activities in 2013 & 2014 resulting in $28,762.95 compensation paid to Nick & $29,776.41 in net income for the company going into 2015. This list does not address pre-2015 activities.
There are additional legal fees between 2015-01-01 to 2018-04-30 that we considered to be fringe benefits for Dan. I did not have time to review the legal bills to understand which payments should be considered fringe benefits for Dan.
Dan gave the company a $44k loan in 2016. This loan will be repaid in full including interest. This email is unrelated to that loan.
Take care

from prenup guy?
Hi, Dan. Your perspective that your separate property should pay its own taxes seems quite reasonable and appropriate. It would not be hard to figure out the ratio of separate property income to community property income and then pay that percentage from other separate property. Rather than sending the taxing authorities two checks, the simplest thing may be to reimburse the community for the expense from your separate property and document the ratio calculation and actual reimbursement.

but consider, after 10 years at 8% your money has almost exactly doubled in value.  so in the pre-tax case this would be   $100 # 2 then taxed at .15 = $200 # (1 - .15) = $170 
In the post tax case we take $100 and tax at .15 to get $85.  



200%   10 year @ 7.18% annual increase
25%   tax rate
15%   cap gains tax


PRETAX INVESTMENT     $100 # 2 # .75  =  $150
POST TAX INVESTMENT   $100 * .75 * 2  =  $150

TAX CONSEQUENCES

-- Quote from Ben:
   Your corporation tax is 100% deductable and your personal income tax is only base on 
   60-65% of the Premium that your corporation contributed on your behalf

-- DAN's DERIVATIONS
   -- For every $1 in AFTER TAX corp money you put into an IUL investments you could have put 
      $0.52 dollars into an after tax investment
 
    T = taxes on IUL = .45(MarginalTaxRate) * .62(participation rate) * investment
    orig = T + investment
    orig = 1.30 * investment

    money that would have been available for investing if I did NOT invest in an IUL ==
      == orig * .89(payrolltax) * .45(TaxRate) == orig * .40 == or == .52 * investment

>>> So for every dollar that I put into an IUL I could have put 52 cents into an after tax investment INSTEAD.  So
    -- after 5 years of annual compounding this would have increased by 23% (assuming 7% average in the market) So
    Account Balance = 64% * invest 


>>> For each dollar invested directly into an IUL I have
    Account Balance = 62% * invest.


MY CONCLUSIONS:
  -- The IUL plan ate up all of the tax savings that the Government gave me, for using it  (62% vs 64%), BUT
  -- It does give me a different risk profile on my money -- this is valuable to me.
  -- It gave me some insurance as a side benefit -- this has marginal value to me.

#### Email to Roger


Roger, 

I want to thank your for your article "Defer or Not" on FPAnet at http://www.fpanet.org/journal/TaxDeferral/  So many pundits provide confusing and sometime contradictory assertions about tax consequences, it is great that you provide such a careful analysis, with worked examples.  Thanks!


After considerable effort, I have been unable to replicate one portion of your article.  That portion is of practical import for me.  On further analysis it seems that the analysis is not quite right.  Since I would like to base my decisions on this bit of analysis, so I am very motivated to get the right answer here.  It would be very valuable if you could look at my very brief analysis of why your assertion is not correct.


First I was unable to replicate your math in section 'When does tax deferral make sense?'  where you consider two ways of investing a lump sum of $100,000.  My results were qualitatively similar to your outcomes (a 12% difference) but I just could not get your specific numbers.

More troubling for me is the assertion you make (which I list in all caps below):

> Today’s IRAs violate at least one of these major assumptions. Under current law, any increase in the value of an 
> IRA, regardless of source, will be taxed at ordinary income rates when the money is withdrawn from the IRA. 
> Today, with the top ordinary rate at 35 percent (federal) and the top capital gains and dividend tax rate at 
> 15 percent, IT IS FAR FROM OBVIOUS THAT DEFERRAL MAKES SENSE, IF DEFERRAL CONVERTS LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAIN OR
> DIVIDEND INCOME INTO ORDINARY INCOME.

It seems to me that is is ALWAYS better to defer taxes as long that the income tax rate remains constant, and capital gains are greater than zero.  (we do not need to concern ourselves with the specific rates, or relation of the rates, or whether gains get moved from income to cap gains, etc.)  It is always true as long as income tax rates to not change:


===ANALYSIS===
Let L be some initial lump sum amount of money available for investment.
Let m be the multiplier resulting from investing any amount, A, for X years of compounding at Y rate of return.
      (NOTE: compounding is super linear in X and Y, but it is a LINEAR function of the initial investment, A.  So there is always some multiplier, m.
Let t be the person's income tax rate

So the IRA payout is:   L *   m   * (1-t)                # the money is multiplied by compounding multiplier 
                                                           and then taxed as income
The Taxable payout is:  L * (1-t) *   m   - capgains     # first income taxes are taken, then multiplied 
                                                           by the compounding multiplier and finally 
                                                           capgains are removed

Roth payout is:         L * (1-t) *   m                  # income taxes are taken, then compounding occurs
                                                           but no cap gains are taken in the end.

CONSEQUENCES:
- ALL cases where income tax ramains constant the IRA is better or as good as Taxable payout
- Shifting to a roth is better when current tax rate LOWER now.
- Staying in an IRA is better when ordinary income rate is LOWER later. 



What is wrong with this analysis?


If nothing is wrong with this analysis then I am unable to square it with assertions you make in the paper, for
example in the executive summary you say:
> [deferral can be better] if certain assumptions are met: tax rates are uniform across income types
> (no difference between capital gain and other income) and constant over time

 ==> but it seems to me there is no dependance on cap gains rates (except that they are not zero)  and it relation to ordinary income tax

you also say:
> Given current tax rates, the compounding benefit of deferral is largely, but not totally, offset 
> by the shifting of long-term gain to ordinary income.

 ==> I cannot understand this calculation as a shifting between long term gains and ordinary income taxing.
     As I understand it, in both cases ever dollar is tax as ordinary income (either before or after)
     the compounding multiplication, but order does not matter here as multiplication is communitive.
     Then in the taxable case, capital gains reduces this amount FURTHER.

 ==> It seems there is no 'shifting' here since in both cases every dollar of the initial amount is subject 
     to income tax... some dollars are just supject to an additional tax.
     (this point is a confusing one, since cap gains are only applied to 'gains' but the way I think
      about this point, is that those gains are already 'tax' since the base was reduced before compounding 
      even began.)



NOTE:  This note is NOT an attack!  I am unsure of myself, but as carefully as I look at this I cannot understand
the flaw in my thinking here.  It seems deferring is always better -- unless ordinary income rises (which of course is possible), but it is the
ONLY way deferring is bad.

NOTE:  In any case, I find your article still quite valuable for its clarity on many point, and because it deals in concrete number more than unsubstantiated assertions.


Any help here would be really valuable for me,

Thanks,
Dan
   ## old
For example, consider a lump sum of $100,000, on which a taxpayer has two alternatives. First, call it Scenario A, 
he can pay tax today, at 35 percent, and invest the net proceeds in a portfolio of growth stocks that will grow at 5
percent a year compounded, and eventually produce long-term capital gain when sold. 
Second, call it Scenario B, he can put the entire pretax sum in a tax-deferred retirement plan, such as an IRA.
Let’s also assume an average return of 5 percent a year. If tax rates don’t change, after 30 years, when he sells
his stocks under Scenario A, he will net, after paying long-term capital gain tax at 15 percent, $237,000.
 Under Scenario B, when he withdraws the entire balance from his IRA and pays ordinary tax at 35 percent, 
he will net $267,000. 

Scenerio-A -- Invest post tax money.
 100,000 * (1-35%) = 65,000  @ 5% monthly for 30 years   = 300,660 - cap gains = 265,311
   cap gains = (300,660-65000) * 15% = 35349   45099 = 255,561
 100,000 * (1-35%) = 65,000  @ 5% annually for 30 years = 290,403 - cap gains = 256,593
   cap gains = (290,403-65000) * 15% = 33810            = 246,843

Scenerio-B -- Invest in IRA
 100,000  @ 5% monthly for 30 years = 462,555 * (1 - 35%) = 300,660

So the IRA payout is:   L *   m   * (1-t)                # the money is multiplied by compounding multiplier and then taxed as income
The Taxable payout is:  L * (1-t) *   m   - capgains     # first income taxes are taken, then multiplied by the compounding multiplier and finally capgains are removed

Notice in ALL cases where income tax ramains constant and capgains is >0 the IRA route is better than the taxable route.

Indeed the different between the two is exactly the capgains paid.
