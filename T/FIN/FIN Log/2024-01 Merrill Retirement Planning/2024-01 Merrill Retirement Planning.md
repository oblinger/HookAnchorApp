ANSWERS:

  

  

****==> Are you and Qingling currently making contributions to your retirement plans. If so, how much and how much are you receiving as a company match?****

  

None from me.  QL is saving approximately 6% of her income into her 401K. 

  

  

****==> What is your monthly principal and interest  payment, interest rate and years remaining on the loan.****

  

House:

$1,063,159 principle

$4,527 / mo payment

2.625% rate   (yay!)

Remaining term. 27years 6mo (fixed)

  

Taxes:

$10,200 twice per year

  

  

  

****==> If you decide to send your daughter to a private school – how much will the cost be per year and will this continue K-12?****

  

(its our son Eli :-) )

  

Private School will be

- $42K/yr tuition + $5K/yr afterschool+food

- We should probably assume K-12, most people don't switch, but we have considered switching part way too.

  

  

****==> Would you like to have savings for private college as well ?****

Yes, we also want to save for college... enough for the 4-year tuition at a good in-state public school.  

Perhaps $60K in today's dollars, though I bet we will want to have a bit more... maybe $100K.  

  

(FYI, we have $25K saved now).  

  

  

****==> You have Qingling’s 401K at 250K with ownership as ‘mixed’. Should only part of this value be included in your retirement plan ?****

- Her 401K has money from before we are married and now money after marriage too.

- My Schwab account has money from before marriage and the sale of my company which was mostly built before marriage as well as money from after marriage too.

  

It’s fine with us if you want to break out our retirement individually as well, but our main focus is understanding if we have enough total for both of our retirements.  

  

The idea is that I retire earlier, and start drawing on my retirement savings, then later QL does the same when she retires.

  

  

****==> We are assuming your 1.6 MM Vanguard account is your 401K or IRA – please confirm.****

- it is a mix of Roth IRA, Regular IRA, and a taxable brokerage account.

- Collectively I am thinking of this as my retirement account.  Though in the past I had drawn on this to pay bills when I was not making enough money while doing startups.  For now the assumption is that I would (mostly) be making enough to not draw on this until retirement.  But startups happen, so modest drawdown is still possible.

  

  

****==> Where are your Google / Waymo etc. stocks held ? We are assuming this is separate from your 400K joint account at Schwab.****

  

- Google in QL's Schwab brokerage

- Waymo and 1-password stock's are held at Shareworks (by Morgan Stanley)
