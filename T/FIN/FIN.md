## DEFERRED COMP
#### 2019-06-13 -- Can go to 0-300K each year
Hi Dan,
 
Here’s what the Actuary said,
 
“This estimate assumed a $0 2019 Schedule C, a 5% return on investment and an amendment to the benefit formula effective for the 2019 plan year. The range in the DB plan is estimated to be from $0 up to $315,969. The contribution for the assets to equal the benefits on a plan termination basis is estimated to be $92,317.
 
Note that the actual maximum deductible contribution cannot be greater than the Schedule C less 1/2 SETD so if the Schedule C is actually $0 for 2019 the maximum deductible contribution for 2019 will be $0.”
 
Like I said there isn’t any punishment or downside to doing $0.00 into the plan, if you do $0.00 for enough years, (I’ll have to get an exact number but I would be 0 contributions for 3+ years) you might have a min deposit to make.
 
This formula just gives you the flex to do $0.00 if you have no income or if you get some income you still have some range to put money away and utilize the plan if need be.
 
Like I said we can add this to the doc re-statement so 2 birds with 1 stone.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thank you,

Hi Dan,
 
I talked to our other Actuary,
 
For the Formula, once we changed it we are stuck with it for 3 years.
Once the plan is shut down and we want to re-open another one – no clock on waiting just need to make sure your benefits accrued in this plan are accounted for.
 
Once your Actuary is back well work on the redesign to get you a lower rate so you have a range of $0.00-X dollars for the next three years.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thank you,

Josh,
 
 
(1) My tax accountant says I need to file a form 5500 before July-1 since my deferred comp plan.
     Have you filed this on my behalf?  Are you going to?  Let me know if I need to do anything.
 
 
(2) I think we need to update my plan before I work 1000 hours this year.
      My plan is to closeout the plan this year so I am not paying beyond this point.
 
Let me know what we need to do.
 
 
Cheers, dan

Josh, 

As you may recall my 1099 income stopped as of July this year, and I have no specific expectation of when the next job like that will occur.  This might mean, now is the right time to make a change to my plan.  In 2019 I expect I will make $150K and my wife will make $300K.  This will probably be a lower year than later years, so I am not sure what implication that has for the fund.

I think my aim in this year is to maximize my deferred income.

What should be my plan going forward?
(Answering this probably requires a phone call)

~-~~

Also I have some questions about the year end Data Collect:

BUSINESSES — Other Businesses Owned.   
   I am currently not listing my other C-corp (New Dawn Analytics), it has nothing to do with this deferral, but I am happy to list it, if I should be.

PLAN — Within 3 years of terminating.
   Am I given what I told you above?

EMPLOYEES — Info for me
Hours:   I was full time until July.  What do I put?


Thanks,
Dan

   5. country's government 10yr - 3mo bond yield spread is positive

#### SLOW MEASURES
#### [CAPE]   Select countries w. CAPE below 10-ish  (ideally below 7)
#### [GDP]    Exclude based on annualized GDP
-- Look at annualize GDP that CAPE was based upon.

-- Chuck's measure -- One way to put it all together for getting into a contry's markets:     (getting out of a countries markets)

   2. country's current index is > than its 10 month simple moving average                    (or <) 
   3. country's government 10yr - 3mo bond yield spread is positive                           (or negative for getting out)

When all three go bad, get out.  Or more conservatively, when 2 of the 3 go bad, get out.
## Tax Consequences
### Tax Deferred Accounts

Plan for 2015
- move $ $ into Roth.
- invest into tradional IRA.  plus SEP.


General Info
- IRA -- 5.5-6.5K per year (tax deferred) reduces as you earn income
- SEP -- 20% of 1099income.  25% of W2 income (of my company).  upto ~30-ish K
- Individual 401K. -- can invest more, but requires annual paperwork
### Misc info
- Defer taxes anytime you can -- unless rates to way up
- Shift to Roth if present taxes are LOWER
- Defer or not:  http://www.fpanet.org/journal/TaxDeferral/
- Roth backdoor  http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/02/08/how-a-high-earning-couple-got-roth-iras-and-you-can-too/

WITHDRAW from Roth
- Opened Roth in 2012
- Can withdraw beginning in 2017

### notes back to Chuck

FED PROB OF RECESSION CHART
It is interesting, if you exited the US market when the Fed's model of recession rose above 20%, and re-entered the market when it dropped below 10%
you would have avoided nearly all recessions (of course this model is build over the same data it is being tested on,
but the model has very few parameters, so this is a bit less of a sin)

It would have been annoying to spand nearly 4 years out of the market starting around 1965 w/o any recession happening!
Even in 2009 it would have put me out of the market for 2 years of the run up before the crash

Still if I come up w. reasonable alternatives for placing my money, I wont be so frusturated to be out of this market.



VANGUARDS ANALYSIS OF "yardsticks"

I agree with you that Vanguard is strongly arguing for some form of P/E ratio measure as most preditive.
If I am understanding them, however, it seems that their 'FED MODEL' is not the same mode that you wrere showing me earlier in your
text.  It seems they did not consider that 'fed model'  

too bad, as it seems so predictive in the fed analysis.


ANALYSIS OF TODAY'S CAPE

http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/PE-Ratios-and-Market-Valuation.php

Their analysis of our percentile rank on CAPE values over time is really quite alarming.
so very different than the Fed Chart.



So it is interesting that looking at the Feb Probababilty of recession we are quite far from it,
yet looking at our percentile rank on the CAPE we are perilously high.  (just eyeballing the data it doesn't quite seem like we are currently 
in the 90th percentile, but that is a bit hard to eyeball.)

Anyway, I continue to be alarmed.  My plan is to be legging into Alibaba, just because I like the long term positioning of that company.
Still that does not really do anything for my current portfolio in the large.  I think CAPE is still probably the best place to start.

I am wondering what you think of Meb's "idea farm"  its only $300/yr so not a big decision.  I am inclind to do it for a year, just 
to get the perspective.  any thoughts or experience with it?

Finally I tried to re-write your conditions just to make sure I was getting your intent correctly:


-- Chuck's measure -- One way to put it all together for getting into a contry's markets:     (getting out of a countries markets)
   1. country CAPE is at a good level  (low relative to historical avg)                       (bad -- or high relative to history)
   2. country's current index is > than its 10 month simple moving average                    (or <) 
   3. country's government 10yr - 3mo bond yield spread is positive                           (or negative for getting out)


the terms in parentheses are really the important ones, correct?
since these are the measures one would track in order to pull the plug.

on the way in, I was imagining using CAPE plus things like the EPI components and well as other qualitivative considerations in choosing
spots to jump into.  is that they way you see it?  or would you imagine having a mechanical decision criteria for he way in as well?


COUNTRY INDEX
- Did you have a specfic OECD dataset that you use in computing "county index"
  at this point I would probably start by shifting into country specfic indexed funds, so a broad index would be best for me
  but I am happy to see any indicies / data sets you have been playing with....


fun stuff.  too bad I am not retired, with all the time to really quant the hell out of this stuff!

## RETIREMENT
### Setting up an Solo-IRA / SEP-IRA
? traditional IRA -- not a great investment??
? steps to create one
??  will pass IRS rules (because of other c-corp)
? complex IRA
? marginal 

x46094 Burnaette  

Individual - 401K ---   ((Qualified plan:  reporting needed))
- Paperwork
  - Need EIN from IRS
  - After 4250K --- file 5500 form every year after $250K -- termination has process
- total limit of 52K per year under 50years
  -- employer contribution.   18-20% of adjusted gross income
  -- salary deferal.          17.5K   (can also be Roth)
     >>> can I take this before 59.5????

Opened Roth in 

Paperwork
- EIN -- needed for I401K but not SEP or 
Simple does not give a much tax deferment

-----
i401K    
 + can contribute more at my age 18K more
 + some can go in as a Roth.
 - locked into an pre-tax
   next year:  
   ===>  first 24K directly in.  then 18% after till   max is 6K higher.
 --- cannot do loans   (but other companies can)
 --- must go into VANG investor shares only

(1) 2014 into SEP.  in 2015 you cannot
(2) in oct. get paper work for i401K



SEP IRA
- total limit this year ~52K    <52K    <20% of salary   (33.8 for Jotter in 2014)
  -- employer contribution.

--- need to have a 1099-schedule C for SEP IRA  (about ~18% or so or something like 30K)



STEPS 
- Have Fund choice.  
- Dept small buisness solutions 5-5p PST  800-992-7188
- Taxibme ready to transfer.
- over phone we can create 





### Tax Differed 
### ROTH

--- Mike Newheart ---
- Before 59.5 (and after 5 years) I can only pull out monies directly placed
  into the ROTH no accrued monies can be withdrawn (w/o penalty)
- After 59.5  everything

- Can contribute $5,500 Roth in 2013

- Comingling -- if I ever made an after-tax contribution to a traditional IRA
  it would taint ALL of my IRAs

- Comingling does not have any effect on a Roth (ever)

### Ideas

S-corp -- limitation:  profits need to be split.   

LLC -- must pay self employment tax (15%) on profits.







AN ANNUITY
-- Many types of so-called permanent life insurance—including whole life, universal life, and variable universal 
life insurance—combine a death benefit with an investment vehicle.

GET 83b SHARES NOW
-- have inverse vesting schedule -- larger the price the *smaller* the options.
-- can we control the sale price flexibly later?
-- how long to I need to hold share, to get cap gains


--- NOPE
OPTIONS WITH A STRIKE PRICE DELTA
-- Can my employer sell me options now that vest in several years, and whose strike price will be set
   AT THAT FUTURE TIME based on the prices of the stock at that future time?
-- This would allow me to know I have money coming, but have it treated as cap gains.


ROLLING SHARES
-- Can my company sell me shares now that will vest at a variable rate depending upon the current valuation of the privately held company.
-- Each month a variable number of shares would vest.
-- After a period of time I could begin a rolling sale of these shares (whose cost basis is very low since I got all at the start)
-- These would be taxed as cap gains.
-- How long would I need to hold the shares, and could the sale be ROLLING and still retain cap gains status?


TAX DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS
--  The challege here is that the company has future unknown beyond a couple of years


TRADING SCHEME #1
-- I have a volitility leveraging automatic tranding strategy for Bitcoin
-- It requires me to own many bitcoins.  If I purchase those coins for this purpose,
   -- do I need to pay taxes on them at the time of purchase?
   -- can redeptions later be counted as cap gains (after cost basis)?

TRADING SCHEME #2
-- Can I use proceeds to fund call/puts as insurance on "long odds bets"
   -- These will be losses that occur now, since each time I must pay this insurance.
   -- Occasionally my "long odds bet" will pay off.  This one trade will have a low cost basis, but a high present value.
   -- Later I can sell the proceeds from this long odds bet with most treated as cap gains. 


HACKER HOUSES 
-- Create partnership with Nick a co-founder in another business.  
-- Buy properties and use those properties to house our Devs in different countries.
-- Contribute excess income from our C-corp into this wholly owned partnership.
-- When it comes time to sell can the fact that this property was used as part of a hacker house buisness allow us to treat this
