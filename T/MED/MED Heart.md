- Diet:  Low meat.  (how much salmon?)

Measuring Progression
- c-reactive protein -
- homeocystein - 
- apo-b - 


+++ CHOLESTEROL - Atorvastin
???   PRESSURE - Salt Levels, (Blood pressure)
+. .    SUGAR - 
++.   STRESS - Sleep


- Fatty Liver:   Slightly elevated bilirubin   1.3 on 10/7
- Diabetes:  Slightly elevated glucose    108 on 10/7;   also elevated

#2 hypertensive blood pressure response to exercise  
#3 the patient developed a supraventricular tachycardia which appears to be AV node reentry during exercise  
#4 abnormal exercise EKG with EKG evidence of ischemia at maximal exercise  
#4 normal resting left ventricular size and systolic function, left ventricular hypertrophy  
#5 no exercise echo evidence of ischemia at a maximal exercise level
