Sum Up

Here’s how to make your New Year’s resolutions succeed:
New Year’s Resolution. Singular: Having five resolutions is like deciding you're going to climb Mount Everest, but first, you'll stop off at the Moon.
Stop Fantasizing: When you dream about having that perfect beach body, your brain is like, “Hell yes, we did it! Let’s celebrate by doing absolutely nothing.”
Make A Plan: Saying “I want to be healthier” is not a resolution. It’s a sentence. It’s as actionable as saying, “I’d like to be taller.” What does “healthier” even mean to you? Be specific and write it down.
MVE: Minimum Viable Effort is about realizing that if you aim for the moon and miss, you won't land among the stars; you'll just float aimlessly in the vast, cold emptiness of space. Initially, the bar for success should be so low it’s practically underground.
Swap, Not Stop: Want to stop drinking so much coffee? Replace it with herbal tea. Now, instead of being wired and jittery, you're just mildly disappointed all the time.
Manipulate Context: Alter your surroundings so that the good choices become stupidly easy and bad ones require just enough effort to make your brain go, “Meh, never mind.”
Use Commitment Devices: Commitment devices aren’t about relying on willpower; they’re about booby-trapping your life so Future You has no choice but to obey.
Use Peer Pressure: Surround yourself with the people you want to be, and their success will rub off on you like glitter at a craft party.
