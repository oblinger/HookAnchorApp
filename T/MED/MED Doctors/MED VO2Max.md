Steve, your typical broad-minded see-both-side thinking seems to falter a bit on this topic, or perhaps it is me who is being myopic?  In any case let me clarify several areas where we agree even as you seem to think we don't:

> Your proposal is total capitulation to illegal, and unfair terms by an invading force. I don't blame any human being for refusing this.

Agreed:  illegal. unfair. no-blame.
But now agreeing to this does not lead where you imagine: 

You wrote:
> If Iran somehow invaded Alaska, say, and declared it to be a Muslim state
> How long do you think it would take before you recognize this new state's "right to exist"?

For your example to work, lets further assume that Iran is much much stronger than the USA and could easily wipe out the remaining 49 states if it needed to.  In that case I would first appeal to stronger nations to force Iran to give Alaska back.  If that fails then I would try to get my nation to "move on" within a generation (25 years).  Its not about right or wrong.  It is about my children being able to exist.  And Iran's actions will be entirely predictable:  Iran will never allow those other 49 states to have freedom, if they contain citizens that have believe they should avenge Alaska.

Dan's Law of Reflexive Human Action is simple and universal:  The weaker party must either (1) win the conflict, (2) find allies to help it win the conflict, (3) or accept that it lost the conflict well enough that its population no-longer harbors a will towards violence/vengeance.  THIS LAW APPLIES EVEN IF THE ENEMY WAS VERY UNJUST.  Anything less and the stronger adversary, following their own self interest, will forever beat the weaker party down so it lacks that power to strike back.  Arguing against this law is like arguing against gravity.  (of course as long as the weaker party's population has renounced violence then it can safely continue to advocate to right the wrongs of the unjust conflict, just as Native Americans safely do within the USA today).  Notice this law is unrelated to justice and fairness.  

Of course fairness and justice are important, but any workable solution cannot violate dan's law, it needs to achieve its fairness and justice within the bounds of this law.  The reason Dan's law limits Palestinians and does not limit Israelis is because they are the weaker party.



Now let me start blaming Israel:  

We know the only path to freedom for Palestinians is for 99.999% of the population to accept Israel enough that they don't want to bomb it.  And to have leaders with the will, support, and ability to forcefully reign in that .001% who do want to bomb Israel.  Presently Palestinian citizens are no where near the level of acceptance required.  And Israel uses this as their reason (excuse) for not affording them greater freedoms.  

But of course Israel and all its conservative governments aren't even try to help Palestinians get to this level of acceptance.  Indeed the belligerent actions of the illegal settlers that are tolerated and sometimes supported by Israel is very clear proof of this.


So as an American citizen I am frustrated that the USA is not demanding Israeli action that would lessen Palestinian rage.  I agree with you, that Netanyahu in particular is quite disingenuous in saying he fears Palestinian rage... he FEEDS that rage for his own ends, for just the reasons you suggest.  And the USA lets him do it!

So we cannot violate Dan's law, but knowing Dan's law exists, we can work to lower the temperature in Gaza... and we don't!

That, for me, this is the sin that we and Israel and Iran are guilty of.

~~

Your quoting of UN Secretary-General is humorous, but not relevant.  I have already noted that the PLO has accepted Israel's right to exist, AND HAS RENOUNCED VIOLENCE which is the important part!

But the reality is that Hamas has NOT renounced violence.  Indeed it believes (correctly or not) that it needs to use violence to force change upon Israel.  And a notable fraction of Gaza (and the west bank) support Hamas.  And many Gazan's believe that nothing will change unless someone like Hamas FORCES change through violence among other things)

I understand why the population in Gaza believe this.  And if Hamas were stronger and Israel were weaker, that path might even work.  but as it is, that path only leads to Israel beating Gaza senseless (see Dan's law of reflexive action).

I think I framed this part incorrectly in my prior response.  It is not exactly about Gazan's accepting Israel, it is about Gazan's believing that violence is not going to work, and committing to not do it. 

They don't have that belief, and they must gain that belief before they can gain freedom.


And we can blame Israel and the USA and Iran for not helping them, and often actively hindering them from gaining this acceptance.


Here is my primary roadmap for eventual peace:
(1) The nations of the world pressure Israel to "lighten up" on the Palestinians
(2) Israel under-pressure provides enough freedoms
