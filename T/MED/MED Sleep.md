    TO TRY 
    - Melatonin    - Melatonin    - Fast acting & time released

    The drug that I forgot earlier was Xanax(alprazolam) it is one kind of benzodiazepines(BZD)
    BZD have multiple effects of sedation, sleeping induction, anti-anxiety, anti-convulsion, and muscle relaxation, 
    BZD are broad groups, some are good in sedation, some are good for anti-anxiety...., so BZD should be used for individual need. 
    I think you did some homework for these drugs, so I can give you some experience from me and my colleague.
    for rapid onset and short~intermediate~long duration BZD:
      Halcion (triazolam):onset can be 15~40 mins, it also can be good for anti-anxiety(like if you are going to have a presentation or surgery next day and you can't sleep), but it is a pregnancy category X drug, not good for going to be pregnant or fetus, so if you guys plan to have a baby, you probably not take it. 
      Xanax (alprazolam):onset can be 20~40 mins, duration 2~6 hrs, it is also good in anti-anxiety, like Halcion, but it make less dizzy when you wakeup, my colleague recommend it if you choose one kind of BZD.
      Rivotril, Klonopin (clonazepam): slow onset and long action, it is more commonly used for anti-panic, seizure..., and it takes more time to taper off drug.
      Ativan (lorazepam): slow onset and long duration, more often used for anti-panic....like Klonopin.

    Besided BZD, there are non-BZD drugs for insomnia, like Stilnox(zoplidem) I mentioned.
      Stilnox, onset is quick, it doesn't have other effect like anti-anxiety or muscle relaxation..., more simply induce you to sleep. It is probably most commonly used non-BZD sleeping pills in Taiwan. This drug works well for my family, if only take less then 20mg(2 pills) for short term use, there won't be addiction. After long term daily use, some people may tolerate it, like you take 0.5# initially for months then you need 1# for the same effect.
    Also there are similar drugs in the same group: Imovane (zopiclone) and Sonata (zaleplon), these are not available in Taiwan, I only know their action duration are different, otherwise I am not clear.

    There is a new drug Ramelteon, similar to melatonin, it works on different receptors so it is more effective and not addictive comparing to melatonin. Maybe you can try this alone or combine with other drug.

    My colleague give me her insomnia suggestion:
      If you are nervous about sometime and that's why you can't sleep: Xanax may help
      If just for jetlag: first 3 days(1~3 day): take 1# Stilnox + Melatonin
                              2nd 3 days(4~6 day): 0.5# Stilnox + Melatonin
                              later (7~day): Melatonin only
      If you worry about the dosage or your jetlag is not bad, start with 0.5# Stilnox is fine.

    Hope these information will help and 
    Happy holidays
