### Vitamin-D
-   [Nutrition Facts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/flashback-friday-will-you-live-longer-if-you-take-vitamin-d-supplements-how-much-should-you-take/)  D3 reduces mortality; Recommend 2000IU/day (could do 3000 to be safe)
- Greger suggests 2000IU/day for anyone not getting enough sun.


### B12
- Greger suggests one 2000mcg per WEEK if you are not eating supplemented foods.
