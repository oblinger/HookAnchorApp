  Key Findings on Ambien Dosing:

  Can You Split Ambien?

  - Regular Ambien: Yes, can be cut/split
  - Ambien CR: NO - destroys controlled-release mechanism

  5mg vs 10mg Effects:

  Duration:
  - Both doses work for ~4-8 hours
  - 5mg may wear off slightly earlier
  - Half-life is ~2.5 hours regardless

  Strength/Effectiveness:
  Based on user experiences and clinical data:

  1. Not Linear: Half dose ≠ half effect
  2. Individual Variation: Some find 5mg fully effective, others need 10mg
  3. FDA Change: FDA lowered standard dose from 10mg to 5mg due to next-day impairment

  User Experiences Found:

  Positive 5mg experiences:
  - "20 years and going strong on 5mg"
  - "Gradually cut back to 5-10mg, still as effective"

  Ineffective 5mg experiences:
  - "5mg did absolutely nothing"
  - "Started with 5mg, then 10mg - waited 30 minutes, no effect"

  Gender Factor:
  - Women metabolize slower - 5mg standard
  - Men can start with 5mg or 10mg

  Bottom Line:

  - 5mg gives most people 70-80% of the effect of 10mg
  - Individual response varies dramatically
  - Duration difference is minimal
  - Start with 5mg - many find it sufficient

  Important: Always consult your doctor before changing Ambien dosage.

## splitting it

I believe you're asking for a summary and URLs about splitting Ambien doses. Here's what I found:

  Summary of Ambien Splitting and Half-Dose Effects:

  Can You Split It?

  - Regular Ambien: Yes, can be cut safely
  - Ambien CR: Never split - destroys time-release mechanism

  Half-Dose Effects (5mg vs 10mg):

  - Not proportional: 5mg provides ~70-80% of 10mg's effect, not 50%
  - Duration: Minimal difference (both last 4-8 hours)
  - Individual variation: Some find 5mg fully effective, others need 10mg
  - Gender matters: Women typically need only 5mg, men 5-10mg

  Key Points:

  - FDA reduced standard dose from 10mg to 5mg due to next-day impairment
  - Many long-term users successfully use 5mg
  - Some people report no effect even at 10mg
  - Response varies dramatically between individuals
