### Unofficial NDA (to avoid disclosure)

   I would like to show you some ideas that I have been working on, but I don’t want 
   to start my “Patent Disclosure Clock,” so do you agree to keep this confidential?


### Letter Of Intent (type language)

This agreement is contingent upon the parties entering into a Definitive Agreement by XXXX Date.
In the event that the parties do not enter into such a Definitive Agreement this aggrement shall 
be null and void.
# Log

### Notes 1.17
how does this sound?



In our intro you can say:
  Dan is:  
  -- world-class in applying AI/KR/ML in unstructured contexts
  -- PhD @ top university
  -- Tapped by US gov to lead over $200M in R&D in the area
  -- Show Jeopardy playing system



then maybe I can follow with details
   -- 6 years provided rolodex across AI field
   -- opportunity to lead complex efforts fusing research outputs from 
      hundreds of researchers into solutions for unstructured environments.





seem ok?


===========================
Consumer Robot for Unstructured Environments
-- must deal w uncertainty.  Compliant arm (safety & cost). because of consumer market Imprecise sensors/actuators 
-- For 3 reasons, uncertainty is central.

Touch perception innovation.
-- consider a blind person cleaning a bathroom – very high degree of uncertainty, but
-- tactile strategies to compensate.
-- toolbox of specially tuned feedback loops

Reactive Plan Planner
-- AI traditionally uses planning to break complex task into parts
-- In our case each “part” is a small reactive plan, 
-- so we use a recursive descent planner to dynamically produce a reactive touch perception plan



Third innovation is a process innovation
-- While working for DARPA (part of the US gov) I Created & Ran $150M R&D effort to understand unstructured text.
-- IBM  (my best performers) used that tech to defeat the best human in the world on a very unstructured task -- the TV game show Jeopardy.
-- What impressed me was their process for maximizing large-software-system experimentation.
-- Each developer was require to integrate their work into a “gold standard” experimentation platform
-- Platform responsible 
-- The spec dictates 100% of software configuration, 100% of hardware config, and 100% of test environment setup off of a unified gold room spec.

-- This automation is a 10x speedup in experiments per day 
   & fuses data from all expriments for use by all developers – which amplifies the value obtained from each test.

-- There is “nothing fancy” here, but nobody else is dong it, and it is a game changer.

Thoughts about milestones:
seems to me we have many items in the architecture, and few milestones.  Plus we will iteratively improve those compoents over the milestones.

So perhaps in each milestone we can simply list the components which get heavily exercised by each milestone,
in most cases this will be multiple components for each milestone.




### Description

Freakin Robots
We build robots, at a consumer pricepoint, designed for unstructured "human" spaces.
We are hiring engineers for autonomous manipulation.



You are looking for the place to stretch yourself,
to prove your self, and IMprove yourself.

We provide that.  We are a small team of
high velocity engineers, each of us
has world class skills in some area, and 
you do too.

We are a 100% remote team, and don't have the time 
or inclination, to micro-manage your remote activites.

You are a self-starter with the motivation and skills
to operate at a very high velocity on your own time
in your own way.  

We provide clear structure in the form of a network of
very detailed milestones, and a daily agile/scrum style
discipline, but you are the one that makes this loose
arrangement work, because you step forward to grab the
right next task, attack it in an effective way, and by reaching
out to the right other teamates to get the job done.

Most of all you are motivated to be proactive, to figure
out the ways forward, to propose them, to involve others,
and to DO them!  and of course you are motivated to build
ROBOTS!  

We are hiring for multiple positions, but currently
focused on Vision and Embedded development.




ABOUT THE FOUNDERS

Joe Arbaugh is a successful serial entreprenur, taken multiple companies public, and was the founding CEO of Neato Robotics

Daniel Oblinger also a serial entreprenur, was a Program Manager at DARPA, funding AI and Machine Learning efforts including the IBM Jeopardy Playing system called Watson

GOLD ROOM
--  Collecting Data -- Repo choice

SWIM LAGE
--  Design pressure sensor



## HOW THINGS MIGHT START


-- MISSION:  Achieve high innovation velocity focused on reducing commercializability risks for a:
                low-cost, general-purpose-ish, arm-based manipulation in uncontrolled environments

-- Leadership Team Interactions
   -- After a brief spurt 
   -- Leadership team has one substanative meeting per week (maybe monday starting @ noon or such)
      and one scrum-style status call (maybe thrusday afternoon)

-- Leadership Team Activities
   -- Joe:   construction of gold-standard room
             hardware design
   -- Dan:   milestones higharachy (w. support from Joe)
             daily-execution scrum(s) oversite  (w. support from Nick, and heavy support from director of engineering)
             Software Integration Architecture
             Compliant action APIs  (later)
   -- Nick:  (plus james, senad, piotr & others @ NDA)
             hiring pipe execution (w. support from Dan)
             product research oversight  (w. support from Dan & consultant)
             execution processes -- scrum-rules, hiring-pipe, could be books & accounting


-- Expected Hires
   1   -- Vision person -- Ph.D. ideal
   1>2 -- Embedded processor person(s) -- 
   1   -- Product research consultant -- part time
   1   -- EE person (later)
   1   -- Mech-E person (later)
   1   -- Robotics person -- ideally this is one of our embedded processor guys

   1   -- Lab tech
   3   -- Programmers (later) -- young/inexperienced/lightening-fast/motivated  -- getting paid reasonable (offshore) salary
   20  -- Interns (later)     --  ditto, but can be less-good as a programmer   -- working for nearly free

   .   -- Part-time Admins (reserach, accounting, etc.)


-- Roadmap
   Month1  --  Gold room functional, hiring pipe filled, interviews completed, 'mostly empty' software stack working
               Arm chosen & purchased
   Month2  --  Key hires made (eng-director (sean), vision, embedded, research-admin)
               They begin working
               tech stack determined & hello world run on each part.
               Daily scrum initiated
               earliest milestones agreed upon & work executing against them
   Month3  --  High velocity innovation underway
               Robust milestones document completed (only for earliest stages completely fleshed)
               Team expansion continues (assuming we have the $$)

   Month6  --  Demonstration of robust manipulation in uncontrolled environments 
                 for some interesting and commercially relevant behavior

   Month9  --  Well it took longer than expected.



   phase I early burn rate (non-founder):  ~50/mo  (3-key fulltime + 5 others)
   - founder burn?  who & how much?

   phase I late burn rate  (non-founder):  ~80/mo  (5-key 10-others)




           
- team is remote.
- when we meet

### SIGNING NDAs

Hi Dan,
 
Out of an abundance of caution, you can certainly take those steps.
 
As far as reviewing an NDA goes, best practice is to send them to me. There is no magic language that you should be looking for, because language elsewhere can override it. Most of the time I will spend 5 minutes on it and say “this looks fine”. Generally, though, we are looking for a number of carve-outs for information:
(i)                  in the public domain or enters the public domain,
(ii)                known to you at the time of the disclosure,
(iii)               subsequently independently developed by you without the use of the information, or
(iv)              becomes known to you by other means not involving a breach of the agreement or other agreement.
 
Hope that helps, Dave
