## PLACES TO LIVE

-- MANILA
- Fort Bonifacio at Victory  (Christans?  Expats)
- anywhere in Bonifacio Global City or Makati. I personally fell in love with all Foreswood (Parklane and Heights)
- Makati's better if your working the night shift and its also a little cheaper. The Fort is much nicer and less congested but there is not a lot of 24 hour places open.

RAILS DEVS

## Email 1  Tim Medina <iamteem@gmail.com>

Hi Dan,

Yes, the top universities (Ateneo de Manila University, University of the Philippines, De La Salle Univ) are here in Metro Manila -- but I don't think they are teaching Rails/Ruby. Currently Metro Manila has the largest pool of web developers and Cebu is the next.

As for organizations, I've only been going to events of Philippine Ruby Users Group (PhRUG). DevCon is another group that helps in promoting the software industry here in the country so you'll see them in events of different groups. You can ask them about the tech landscape here in the Philippines.

Last weekend, there was also a hackathon/contest hosted by webgeek.ph so you can also ask them your questions.

Here are the links:

PhRUG: There's a mailing list in google groups (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ruby-phil) and a facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/phrug/). Site: http://pinoyrb.org/

DevCon: http://devcon.ph/

I hope this helps.

Regards,
Tim

Hi Dan,

It's great that you're considering setting up a shop here in the Philippines.

It is true that the largest talent pool for developers would be in Manila. You should consider looking in Baguio City. I know a group of great Ruby on Rails developers there. Most of the Ruby on Rails developers here would be freelanced. 

I would also suggest to check the PHRUG (Philippine Ruby Users Group). That is the support community that we have here. You may want to check http://webgeek.ph/. This is an all-around support group for web developers.

Here is a list of people that you may want to contact:
- Katherine Pe
  She's one of the Rails developers I know in Baguio City.
  You can contact here at her website. http://www.blog.bridgeutopiaweb.com/

- Andrei Navarro
  He's one of my mentor in Rails
  You can contact him at dreinavarro@gmail.com
  
You may want to check http://www.proudcloud.net/. They are the most prominent Ruby on Rails shop here in the Philippines.

I hope this information helps you. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Best Regards,
Adrian Peterson Co
