Spent SECOND week setting up obsidian, and just not being very productive.  Really the goals for next week will not have changed much... hopefully my velocity will!


### 2022-03-14 - Q2 GOALS

I need to reboot the way I work, my motivations, my output, my processes.
I will keep refining this note as I progress, lets see how far I can get!

NOW
- To start with I will do weekly check-ins for how I am doing.
- Progressively expand the planning I am doing & effective hours per day

KEY CHANGES FOR A GOOD WORKDAY
- Practice goal setting at all levels: day, week, month, quarter, task
- Focus on each day being a good work day
- Before starting, spend bit of time planning
- After finishing, reflect on outcomes
