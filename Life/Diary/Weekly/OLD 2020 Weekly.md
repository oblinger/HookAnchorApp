### 2020-04-00 MONTH APRIL habits

Here are some ideas to change thing

INTERVENTION -- Really a major intervention is needed here.  need to spend
- JNL -- Spend time each day to try to consider and tactically plan 

POST DINNER -- Jnl, Plan, Pressure, Pills
- Do journaling, plan next day, pills

MORNING JUMP
-- Pee then do >20min before. email.
-- Aim for >90m of hardest task before break

WEEKLY BUCKETS
- 5-10 buckets with num slots and week goal
- goal -- focused time goal; or achievement objective
- slots -- number of 90 min slots  (plan for 20-30 slots; this is heavy)
- plan -- plan for week, then for each day

FOCUS 
- too much time is happening w/o real focus.  
- use pomodoro timer to aim for chunks of focused time.  3 per slot

AFTERNOON CARDIO

### 2020-03-23 focus fail
WEEK Mar23 

Outcome:  really failed to focus.  low discipline.  confusion in UF.  low morale in AF work.  Very distracted by life around me.

Just focus Dan!  Really trim the hours of sideways motion!!

PRIMARY
* UF urf ; lex+exe+lang+var docs ->var code ; 
* Chipstack spike SENT ; quick text w matt 
* Care + Home

### 2020-03-00
MARCH

MY SITUATIONS:
- STALLED -- I am not making good progress on key things.
- SWITCH -- Even when I get time to work, I switch away quickly.
- DOUBTS -- Doubts about path, about value, about global direction.
	- CHOICE -- Get blocked at choice point.  stalled at too many of them.
	- VALUE -- Doubts the ultimate value of what I am doing
	- IMPACT -- Doubts about the impact of what I am doing

KEY ISSUES TO RESOLVE:
- CLARITY -- Have enough focus to be clear on work to do
- CHUNK -- Have large enough chunks of time to make progress
- RESOLVE -- Have sufficient resolve TO make progress in that moment
- JOY -- Receive sufficent joy in doing it, that I do it.
- CONFIDENCE -- Have confidence that I can make progress in that moment
- ORGANIZATION -- Have organization needed to work effectively.
- SINGULAR -- Have enough focus on a single thing to cause this to go.

NOT SURE WHICH OF THESE IS FAILING MOST:
==> Need to watch this month to try to understand

ACTIONS TO TAKE:
- MORNINGS -- Get up early; Do a 3h block.
- EVENING -- After Eli story 'till bed; Do a 2h block.
- CLARITY DRIVE -- If confused, use focus time to write out clarity
- DIAGNOSE -- Pay attention, each time you cannot achieve good block, why not

#### Sara Note
Sara,

This is Dan (founder at Analytics Fire).  We spoke at the solar expo about our respective experiences in making distributed team work well.

This was an exciting conversation since it seems your teams are also distributed in ways needing to fight similar battles.  I am very interested to hear details of what has and has not worked, and to see if/how our processes might apply in other contexts like yours.

You suggested that I chat with Michael Dennis since he was most focused at that level on team collaboration.  Can you help me get such a meeting set up?  Also just curious, are you guys in the shell offices on New Montgomery?  If so we might even meet Dennis for coffee at the Red Door or such since we are so close.

Let me know,
--Dan

#### Note to Vik

WOW!   I did write that….

It was kind of a fugue moment 
I got off the phone with you, and a few things just seemed to float in front of me plain as day.


Makes me realize a few things:
- I am never as clear about myself as I can be with others I am close to.
- I am so caught up in my own little life dramas and actions, I rarely take the moment to do something like that.  I should be less self focused more often.
- Each one of us probably only have a handful of others that know us well enough to write something like that.
- I was kind of a bastard in a few spots… not overly mean, but I was not pulling any punches!

Super glad I wrote it!


AND EVEN MORE EXCITED ABOUT YOUR NEXT CHAPTER WITH STEPH!
Very exciting, very solid partner!!

Cheers!

I don’t know if these ideas are right… they seem right to me, but this is abstract stuff, hard to be sure.



~~

Career Happiness For Vik:
— a life situation where you “don’t have to struggle”
— easily afford comforts (maybe this is several hundred K per year of forever flow???)
— have a value to the universe that you can be proud of and identify as “yours”
— have a value to the universe that is recognized by others 
— have a value that gives you some authority over some thing or some people ???
— have a job that does require some notable attention / effort
     (I claim that if does not do this last thing, then it cannot truly do the earlier ones)

I also have this idea that the NATURE of the work needs to be of a particular kind.
— you like thinking big thoughts, talking about them, refining them, collaborating around them etc.
— you DONT like the lowest level of “doing” on most things
— you DONT like the “doing” of many things for lengths of time.
~~

This is quite a precarious situation.  Doing a thing that others have not done often requires ALOT of low level grunt doing of things.  Really unglorious stuff, and stuff in many wrong directions before the winning right directions clicks into place.

So your nature has big risks of running in a direction for a bit, then getting bogged down / bored / frustrated, long before it might mature into a context where most of your time were doing the work that fits your nature.

Rinse and repeat and you have a life of short sprints in different directions, but ultimately going nowhere.

~~

Techno therapy is a strong ray of hope within this picture for a couple of reasons.
— You have already made several sprints all that align with this one idea.
— It would be hard to make the same in a new direction.
— The fact that you have made this sprints in these consistent direction is evidence that it already aligns with your nature in multiple deep ways.
— techno therapy also has a nature that aligns with all of the positive career happiness metrics above.
— I see nothing else on the horizon.  Which has the big picture stuff you like…. All other options seem like they are either living within a very small budget so cash can grow w/o a job, or doing some “doing” that does not appeal.


~~

But there is a problem.  Actually getting to any spot with TT (or most any other idea) is going to require an amount of low level “doing” that is not really ideal for your nature.

This problem is the most likely reason that the whole thing blows up into a whole lot of nothing.

This problem is compounded doubly by the fact that not only will a lot of low level “doing” be required, but w/o a bigger team there is no one to delegate ANYTHING too.  Even the most painful, least vik specialized doing will either be done by your or will fail to be done at all.

It is also compounded triply by a need to keep running in a straight line long enough to measure if it is working or not.  But this will likely feel like its TOO long running in a line.

~~

At some level you see these issues, and know the looking down that path there is alot of doing that doesn’t look like Vik kind of doing.

And I think this realization engenders a bit of “magical thinking”.  E.g. it causes you to start looking for that path where somehow you jump over all that messy middle and land in some “other side” where it is a more acceptable work style.  e.g. the 8-figure exit etc.

Its not that I think you are not able to assess things well, but rather you have a strong bias towards that magical thinking, since all the other thinking seems to be driving you thru alot of SHIT.

~~

I don’t see the idea in here that yields big investment and 8-figure exits.
Not saying it is not there, but I don’t see it.

But I *DO* see a challenging path that leads progressively towards a vik compliant career, and progressively dodges the vik nature misalignments.

So that is why I aim towards that path.  

...

The path in a nutshell:

(1) stasis  — you earn enough that you can keep doing it, and are mixing the low level work with enough higher level thinking / doing that you are just barely ok with it all.

(2) growth — you grow the reputation of TT and your business while being in stasis.

(3) establishment — you grow your business and your reputation in TT both in a way that it really makes sense for you to be spending increasing time only on the reputation building aspects of the work, while others are doing much/all of the consuling / administration etc.

(4) taking flight — once the business has really grown, then you hire in professional management, and really back away from all aspects that you want to back away from.

Even if you manage to get to #4 it will take real dedicated effort on some occasions to save the business from one or another catastophe, and as the founder only you have the real vested interest to do this.  

I think road is not an easy one, nor a quick road.  It would likely be a decade plus, and it would at least some of the time require lots of low level doing.  So it is not a super easy path for vik nature, but it is the best path I see….


...

If you went down the path above, then it is super critical that you find others Steph and/or others who are essentially bought into the long term success.  Your nature is self derailing, and has gaps of continuity that absolutely must be bridged if success is going to happen.

Also if you are going to follow this path, and not want to put a pencil thru your temple, you will need to find a person here or there along the way that you can share / delegate the most painful parts of low level doing.

...

Steph is not ideal in all ways as a partner.  In some ways she needs to be tougher to keep the rudder of the ship steering straight… maybe she could learn this.

But she IS in some way an opposite of you…. She is not the strong visionary.  She is ok “just doing” as long as she sees the immediate small gains to be had.

This constraint can be accommodated… indeed being forced to “answer the mail” for her need to clear progress would be a natural function for keeping you on the path listed above.

...


So be REAL careful about dismissing this chance…. Not clear who else rides that path above with you.  Not clear what other path if not that one.


...


Stream of consciousness off.  :-)
