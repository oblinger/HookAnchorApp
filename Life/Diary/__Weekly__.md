### APRIL habits

Here are some ideas to change thing

INTERVENTION -- Really a major intervention is needed here.  need to spend
- JNL -- Spend time each day to try to consider and tactically plan 

POST DINNER -- Jnl, Plan, Pressure, Pills
- Do journaling, plan next day, pills

MORNING JUMP
-- Pee then do >20min before. email.
-- Aim for >90m of hardest task before break

WEEKLY BUCKETS
- 5-10 buckets with num slots and week goal
- goal -- focused time goal; or achievement objective
- slots -- number of 90 min slots  (plan for 20-30 slots; this is heavy)
- plan -- plan for week, then for each day

FOCUS 
- too much time is happening w/o real focus.  
- use pomodoro timer to aim for chunks of focused time.  3 per slot

AFTERNOON CARDIO

### WEEK Mar23 - focus fail

Outcome:  really failed to focus.  low discipline.  confusion in UF.  low morale in AF work.  Very distracted by life around me.

Just focus Dan!  Really trim the hours of sideways motion!!

PRIMARY
* UF urf ; lex+exe+lang+var docs ->var code ; 
* Chipstack spike SENT ; quick text w matt 
* Care + Home

### 2020 MARCH

MY SITUATIONS:
- STALLED -- I am not making good progress on key things.
- SWITCH -- Even when I get time to work, I switch away quickly.
- DOUBTS -- Doubts about path, about value, about global direction.
	- CHOICE -- Get blocked at choice point.  stalled at too many of them.
	- VALUE -- Doubts the ultimate value of what I am doing
	- IMPACT -- Doubts about the impact of what I am doing

KEY ISSUES TO RESOLVE:
- CLARITY -- Have enough focus to be clear on work to do
- CHUNK -- Have large enough chunks of time to make progress
- RESOLVE -- Have sufficient resolve TO make progress in that moment
- JOY -- Receive sufficent joy in doing it, that I do it.
- CONFIDENCE -- Have confidence that I can make progress in that moment
- ORGANIZATION -- Have organization needed to work effectively.
- SINGULAR -- Have enough focus on a single thing to cause this to go.

NOT SURE WHICH OF THESE IS FAILING MOST:
==> Need to watch this month to try to understand

ACTIONS TO TAKE:
- MORNINGS -- Get up early; Do a 3h block.
- EVENING -- After Eli story 'till bed; Do a 2h block.
- CLARITY DRIVE -- If confused, use focus time to write out clarity
- DIAGNOSE -- Pay attention, each time you cannot achieve good block, why not

### Sara Note
Sara,

This is Dan (founder at Analytics Fire).  We spoke at the solar expo about our respective experiences in making distributed team work well.

This was an exciting conversation since it seems your teams are also distributed in ways needing to fight similar battles.  I am very interested to hear details of what has and has not worked, and to see if/how our processes might apply in other contexts like yours.

You suggested that I chat with Michael Dennis since he was most focused at that level on team collaboration.  Can you help me get such a meeting set up?  Also just curious, are you guys in the shell offices on New Montgomery?  If so we might even meet Dennis for coffee at the Red Door or such since we are so close.

Let me know,
--Dan

### Note to Vik

WOW!   I did write that….

It was kind of a fugue moment 
I got off the phone with you, and a few things just seemed to float in front of me plain as day.


Makes me realize a few things:
- I am never as clear about myself as I can be with others I am close to.
- I am so caught up in my own little life dramas and actions, I rarely take the moment to do something like that.  I should be less self focused more often.
- Each one of us probably only have a handful of others that know us well enough to write something like that.
- I was kind of a bastard in a few spots… not overly mean, but I was not pulling any punches!

Super glad I wrote it!


AND EVEN MORE EXCITED ABOUT YOUR NEXT CHAPTER WITH STEPH!
Very exciting, very solid partner!!

Cheers!

I don’t know if these ideas are right… they seem right to me, but this is abstract stuff, hard to be sure.



~~~~~~

Career Happiness For Vik:
— a life situation where you “don’t have to struggle”
— easily afford comforts (maybe this is several hundred K per year of forever flow???)
— have a value to the universe that you can be proud of and identify as “yours”
— have a value to the universe that is recognized by others 
— have a value that gives you some authority over some thing or some people ???
— have a job that does require some notable attention / effort
     (I claim that if does not do this last thing, then it cannot truly do the earlier ones)

I also have this idea that the NATURE of the work needs to be of a particular kind.
— you like thinking big thoughts, talking about them, refining them, collaborating around them etc.
— you DONT like the lowest level of “doing” on most things
— you DONT like the “doing” of many things for lengths of time.

~~~~~~~

This is quite a precarious situation.  Doing a thing that others have not done often requires ALOT of low level grunt doing of things.  Really unglorious stuff, and stuff in many wrong directions before the winning right directions clicks into place.

So your nature has big risks of running in a direction for a bit, then getting bogged down / bored / frustrated, long before it might mature into a context where most of your time were doing the work that fits your nature.

Rinse and repeat and you have a life of short sprints in different directions, but ultimately going nowhere.

~~~~~~~

Techno therapy is a strong ray of hope within this picture for a couple of reasons.
— You have already made several sprints all that align with this one idea.
— It would be hard to make the same in a new direction.
— The fact that you have made this sprints in these consistent direction is evidence that it already aligns with your nature in multiple deep ways.
— techno therapy also has a nature that aligns with all of the positive career happiness metrics above.
— I see nothing else on the horizon.  Which has the big picture stuff you like…. All other options seem like they are either living within a very small budget so cash can grow w/o a job, or doing some “doing” that does not appeal.


~~~~~~~

But there is a problem.  Actually getting to any spot with TT (or most any other idea) is going to require an amount of low level “doing” that is not really ideal for your nature.

This problem is the most likely reason that the whole thing blows up into a whole lot of nothing.

This problem is compounded doubly by the fact that not only will a lot of low level “doing” be required, but w/o a bigger team there is no one to delegate ANYTHING too.  Even the most painful, least vik specialized doing will either be done by your or will fail to be done at all.

It is also compounded triply by a need to keep running in a straight line long enough to measure if it is working or not.  But this will likely feel like its TOO long running in a line.

~~~~~~~

At some level you see these issues, and know the looking down that path there is alot of doing that doesn’t look like Vik kind of doing.

And I think this realization engenders a bit of “magical thinking”.  E.g. it causes you to start looking for that path where somehow you jump over all that messy middle and land in some “other side” where it is a more acceptable work style.  e.g. the 8-figure exit etc.

Its not that I think you are not able to assess things well, but rather you have a strong bias towards that magical thinking, since all the other thinking seems to be driving you thru alot of SHIT.

~~~~~~~

I don’t see the idea in here that yields big investment and 8-figure exits.
Not saying it is not there, but I don’t see it.

But I *DO* see a challenging path that leads progressively towards a vik compliant career, and progressively dodges the vik nature misalignments.

So that is why I aim towards that path.  

~~~~~~

The path in a nutshell:

(1) stasis  — you earn enough that you can keep doing it, and are mixing the low level work with enough higher level thinking / doing that you are just barely ok with it all.

(2) growth — you grow the reputation of TT and your business while being in stasis.

(3) establishment — you grow your business and your reputation in TT both in a way that it really makes sense for you to be spending increasing time only on the reputation building aspects of the work, while others are doing much/all of the consuling / administration etc.

(4) taking flight — once the business has really grown, then you hire in professional management, and really back away from all aspects that you want to back away from.


Even if you manage to get to #4 it will take real dedicated effort on some occasions to save the business from one or another catastophe, and as the founder only you have the real vested interest to do this.  

I think road is not an easy one, nor a quick road.  It would likely be a decade plus, and it would at least some of the time require lots of low level doing.  So it is not a super easy path for vik nature, but it is the best path I see….


~~~~~~

If you went down the path above, then it is super critical that you find others Steph and/or others who are essentially bought into the long term success.  Your nature is self derailing, and has gaps of continuity that absolutely must be bridged if success is going to happen.

Also if you are going to follow this path, and not want to put a pencil thru your temple, you will need to find a person here or there along the way that you can share / delegate the most painful parts of low level doing.

~~~~~~

Steph is not ideal in all ways as a partner.  In some ways she needs to be tougher to keep the rudder of the ship steering straight… maybe she could learn this.

But she IS in some way an opposite of you…. She is not the strong visionary.  She is ok “just doing” as long as she sees the immediate small gains to be had.

This constraint can be accommodated… indeed being forced to “answer the mail” for her need to clear progress would be a natural function for keeping you on the path listed above.

~~~~~~


So be REAL careful about dismissing this chance…. Not clear who else rides that path above with you.  Not clear what other path if not that one.


~~~~~~~~


Stream of consciousness off.  :-)

W1 Enphase/Redis/Todo W2 W3 UF
R1 SalesDeck
UF 10-chunks

- UF FOCUS -- aim to get scanner of ufdocs running.
- SALES DECK --
- RESTART -- Redis / Jayant

Went to hospital w. QL; week fell apart;
Being lazy/disorganized/not doing hardest thing first
Did get UF work done (underlying unicore for textputer)
### 2019.08.14 - WEEK
Short week.  Focus on getting back in groove.  and some quick reactions. 

R1 Cubi/Cemex/Jayant  R2 Pitch Deck
F1 GDS lists F2 UF
UF 4 chunks
### 2019.08.14 - Dream
- Went with group of 4 companions to an amusement park, or resturants and pools, etc. on a pier.  
- There were lots of interactions with the possibility of sex, but I (we?) turned them down.
- The attendants as this park were kind of evil automoton-like people.  This place was wrong.
- we eventually pulled some part of it down, I was against this, but its effect eventually was to cause the whole place to collapse.

- This repeated, but this time Erlick, almost immediately tore something, to cause collapse.

- The third time maybe we acquiest to this place.

- Then someone (a woman, not in our group) realized the whole thing (marriage) was wrong, and so she screamed and it lifted some stuff off the top of a field of snow.  Over and over she shouted to remove section after section in a grid, until it was all gone.  Clearly she was relieved.

- This encouraged me to consider the same.  But as I did, it did not seem her solution was right for me.
### 2019.08.05 - AUGUST - Sleep - TopFocus

- SLEEP -- I am loosing 2 hrs per day in 1/2 sleep.  My plan:
	- THINK -- For 20min only think of dreams, 
		zero thinking about ideas or tasks.
	- WAKE -- At 20min get up and work for 2-4 hours.
- TOP ONLY -- Focus only on top tasks.
	- SLAM -- Slam non top tasks aside (drop, delay, quick do)
	- ATTEND -- Put focused slots on top tasks.
	- GOAL -- Define and achieve specific goals for top tasks
### 2019.08.05 - WEEK 
- UF lots!  tree, printer, print
- Sales summary -- written/slides of our process
- Baby final

UF -- text / printer / print? / CSV?  (one way pipe)
Sales -- summary of process; first thoughts on top sentences
Baby -- all final -- name/packed/room

Baby came early, and all hell broke loose.
Did get early week done.  No UF really.
### 2019.07.29 - WEEK
-- UF KM -- parse markdown; map; ?? bullet/flag; CSV
-- Sales -- Dan + flow
-- 1/2 day proj work

CHUNKS 3 + 10uf

- I did make progress on sales.
- barely kept pace with AF duties
- Spent lots of time on UF.  pretty effective.
- Wasting 1-2 hours per day on bad sleep.
### 2019.07.22 - WEEK

-- FAST execution.  toss balls FAST.  Use extra time to:
-- move UF fwd.  frame List app
-- move sales fwd.
-- do some Q2

Chunks 7 -> ~10 (deleted records)

*M1 weekly, *M2 lists
[Duplicate] UF Interpreter  [[ 3 chunks ]]

-- found good focus for UF.  2.5 days of good work on it.
-- No sales, no Q2
### 2019.07.15 - WEEK
-- Hoping to get chunk execution to a more reliable high level
-- Many sales threads to tame.  
-- UF: need to figure where I am going.  Need to put time in.
-- Q2 progress: Prenup, Sales thinking ( progress on both)

Chunks 9 -> 5
   
WEEK:
*M1,*M2  Enphase

*W1 uf  -W1 lists -W2 sales
F2 Prenup;  F2 Google drive org . ???

UF Interpreter  [[ 3 chunks ]]

did NOT get chunk execution more reliable.
DID tame sales threads
did NOT get UF direction in place.  did not put in time.
did NOT make Q2 progress
### 2019.07.08 - WEEK

Firing on all Cylinders:
- Hope to have 5 days w. 2 chunks per day
- Both Enphase, Cubi, humming
- Szymon in place
- Email burst out
- UF EXE / IP thinking / Browser
- Little baby reading / little name think

CHUNKS 11  did 5+1

*M1 *M2 proposal work.  *M3 Weekly&Lists
*T1 *T2 +T3 Enphase -T3 UF
W2 Google drive org . ???
W1 Prenup
R1 Sales Thinking 1-2 chunks .  ???
>> UF Interpreter  [[-T3, W1, W3, +S2 ]]

Lots of enphase interactions.  weekend was sideways.
### 2019.07.01 - WEEK
- Planned 11 chunks

RESULT
- End of week was chaotic because of 4th, beginning was chaotic because of sales pulse
- Monday and Tuesday were very productive.  Chunking did help some.
- Weekend Sunday was productive for UF.
	goal is narrowed.  focused bottom up on testing.

*M1 Calls
*M2 Weekly
-M3 Lists
*T1 SALES triage . [[M3, +T2, T2]]
-W1  Lists [[???]]
??  UF Interpreter . [[*T2, *W2, F2]]
-W1 Sales Thinking 1-2 chunks
-R1 Google drive org
-R1 Prenup

Chunks  6 of 11.  plus 3
### 2019.07.01 - JULY - Work chunks first

I am not making the progress I could/should be making.
Couple of ideas:
- Need to have 2-3 focused chunks of 2-3 hours each.  (DOTS outside on lower right)
- Need to have morning free from meetings and working (CIRCLE outside on lower right)
	- Circle surround dot(s) that occurred in the morning (upto 1pm)
	- Circle if at least 2 hours free in morning.  Trying for 8a-1p

- Need to prioritize the work chunks.  Need to reset and start one if off track.
- Even doing lists of activties can count as a work chunk.  But only 3 per week can count.

JULY GOALS
-- House / Baby read (no pressing tasks)
-- AF Projects humming
-- ?? UF interp EXE+  (maybe printing new colon)
-- Most weeks 2x5 ; Sales thinking push fwd



MARCH GOALS
-- Uniform Novelty (Markdown, Agenda, Embed, Collab) . have 1meet & slides 
-- Uniform Finish markdown parser
-- ?? Uniform Useful Py impl
-- Todo Lists -- Get time sensitive Doc/House/Fin moving.  make progress
-- AF Sales ???
-- 1-2 meetings per week
-- ETC -- read 3 books.  do expllicit thinking
### 2019.07.01 - WEEK Back in town - slow week

I didn't get so much done this week.  At the end I had some luck with UF.
Something has to change.  See July Monthly Experiments.
### 2019.06.25 - WEEK Baby Shower Weekend

Last week was quick becuase it was sandwiched by two trips.  

- Catchup on all work proposals (enphase/legrange)
- Chunk of UF work on interpreter
- 1 day of home stuff

At end of this week I should feel in groove on home/baby/work proposals and have 1-day of UF interp done.
### 2019.06.18 - WEEK CEMEX weekend

Did not complete my prime tasks for the week.
CEMEX took up notable time.  As did daily tasks.

Upcoming week is shorted by a day.
Should be in good position to execute THREE core tasks this week W/R/F mornings.

Aim to keep meeting off of mornings.
### 2019.06.09 - WEEK Lists caughtup, Living room put together

I feel good this week that both by todo lists, and living room are in much better shape.
I have the idea that I can really "complete these" -- get them to the 80% done state, and focus on other areas of my life.

I worry that there is no commercializable path for uniform.
Also these days I put 5hrs per week into Uniform.  it is tiny.  most time is AF and home.

I need to time box both AF and home, then decide what is to be done with remainder of time.

I am pretty relaxed and happy these days.  Baby is comming too.
### 2019.06.05 - JUNE - Trying 2 chunks of focus on many days

### 2016.05.25 – Lex Ownership

My goals:
l-- GROW – Able to safely work at Martian, Google, etc.  and retain ownership of newly grown Lex stuff
L-- INIT – Able to initiate new things and have them owned by me.
X-- CREDIT – Get broad credit for work done.

C-- MAJOR – Be the major owner of commercial entity using it.
	Ob Labs LLC   (Owns Uniform)
		ML-LLC  Dan Nick Sean
	

I don’t know how I might use Uniform in the future, but I won’t use my ownership of it to thwart aims that NDA puts significant and (hopefully ongoing) effort against.

Informal:
 If NDA starts doing a thing w. Uniform, then I never stop it, or try to own it.
 if NDA does not stick with a thing, or never really puts significant effort against a goal, then that goal is fair game for me to later own

### 2010.12.17 – LESSONS FROM DATING ELAINE

lesson

- I could not face the conclusions I was coming to.  So I did not.  but I also did not act.

- My expectations (rules) about how this should be froze me away from breaking up, and away from marrying.  neither met criteria, but by sheer force of will I imagined I could change one or the other.  Or at least fantasized that I could (Even thought at another level I expected I could not).


2010.11.18 – A day laid waste

### 2010.10.00 – Gave up on Siege

It occurred to me after our phone call yesterday, that ours was one of the best business relationships that I never had.  I was worried early on, based on the comments coming from STO, but I have found them to be quite groundless.  There have been several times when it was clearly in your best interest to simply let things ride along w/o comment—after all you were getting effort for free.  But you (or at least your wife) took it upon yourself to be explicit about assumptions being made.

In the end, it turns out that integrity is one of the most prized attributes in close partnerships.  Many folks believe they are operating with integrity, but integrity is not defined by your actions when there would be consequences, it is defined by those rare moments when there would NOT be consequences.  I think you have the right stuff to lead a successful organization—and for the kind of business you are shooting for—it is so critical that folks *want* to work with you, to trust in you.

I think early on you were really ready to open up to significant sharing.  You pushed for something safe for both of us.  Later you conveyed our lowering sense of opportunity in a good, open way.  Several times being explicit about it—all good stuff.  From my point of view this time was well worth it.   I really did put quite a bit of mental energy in this direction, but it pushed me to think about my time post DARPA, and gave me an inside look at starting my own gig.

In 20-20 hindsight, I would have played the game of the last year a little differently.  Playing around with SBIRs was probably not the right game.  Given that you were already in motionthe night we first spoke, and I was mentally quite far from leaving DARPA, I needed a “shoot the moon” as a strategy for catching up.

I needed to pitch work (white papers) that were generally separate from your current thrusts.  It is hard for that to work, since you would still be the one shopping those papers around.  Still it was really what was needed.  Winning work off of such a paper would be the basis for a quarter of Siege.  Winning a SBIR even two, would not qualify.  Especially if you have Joe doing the same w. little equity!  It just doesn’t add up.

I am not quite sure what to make of the fact that I did not even manage to achieve this lower goal.  In a certain sense it was a partial test, there was never enough riding on a SBIR to merit putting in sustained effort.  Still, it makes me question if I am too far from cyber to play that game.  I don’t think that is true.  My belief about AI+cyber is essentially unchanged.  Still it does give me pause…

At this point I think I am too late to get enough of Siege for it to make sense.  I do plan to continue down this path of pitching a Cyber program (at least if management gives positive signals).  If I do move in that direction post DARPA there may be some way to share equity across two inter-related companies which affords the right up sides for both of us.  I don’t know, but I am open to it.

In the end, I am convinced that you are the kind of person I would trust to work with—I would want to work with.  I am also convinced that the world is more win-win than anything else.  Whenever possible it is better to pool resources rather than going it alone.  So who knows, I don’t see the way forward right now, but I would be looking for that way forward.

Best luck with Siege!

### 2010.10.09 – Organizing Self

FOCUS – I can do many different things, but I jump from idea to idea way too quickly.  
- At DARPA there are so many efforts that have never gone anywhere, but I never ran into a wall, I just got working on something else.
- With Jason/Siege I never put the work in necessary to join siege, but still put much work in.
- In my research I have jumped from place to place

MAJOR TASKS
- NewStart
- Mgt MR/BL
- Admin
- NextJob
- Decision
- Fun


MY RESEARCH FOCUS – Teachable systems
This is consistent w. my work from: IBM, from BL, and Cyber or ISR.

–  work @ IBM 
### 2010.04.01 – Life is moving faster

There is much less time, than I am pretending there is.  But less that needs doing as well.
- Need to ensure that the important stuff is getting done.
- Need to ensure that each day is lived the way I want it to be lived.
- Need to be strategic in leveraging my activities.  Too often I build the first half but don’t reap the benefits.

- Need to be strategic in spending time.  I kill too many hours in less than effective ways:
   Meetings/calls that take too long.  Getting to into the details.  Procrastinating.  Piddling on small stuff.
   Working on tasks that are not the most impt.

- Days must have space & periods of fast activity.

- Should have few activities in each bucket, then keep coming back, so each activity is pushed to a place of value.
- 



BUCKETS OF ENERGY
Project – personal “fun” projects – these can also have other value but must be fun.
Career – Pushing my career forward – beyond my day job
Work – My day job
Spiritual – Spiritual growth
Family&Friends – Paying attention to those that matter
Mate&MyFamily – D 
Self – Health, Finance, Possessions, Capabilities

PROJ:  TightKeys, ConfigTool, ?jason?
CAREER:  Jason, Pubs, StartupContacts, 
WORK:  Fewer more focused hours.  
FAMILY&FRIENDS:  Just a bit of time from time to time
MATE:  Make a decision
SELF:  Pretty on track.  Focused hours
### 2010.01.02 – From last year’s retreat  (12/2008)
### 2009.12.29 - Elasticity of Time
This morning
1.5h	bed	0
1h	ready	.5
.5	walk	.5
1.5h	food	.5
2h	web	0
6.5		1.5

Lesson learned.  In all cases I need to get to my focused hour *immediately*
That focused hour must be fun too so I want to do it
### 2009.12.19 - not great - low motivation
Things are not great.  I am at a place of very low motivation.  
My current situation is reinforcing some habits that are not great:
No movement with elaine… by having big ideas, but no progress (just putting stuff onto lists), 
Expending the energy to *do* into doing small things (clean house)
Cant break free of existing commitments long enough to hit bottom and take new course, whole weeks are going by, where I am just exhausted in the evening, and only put off anything … everything till the next day…. When it all happens again.

Will attempt new habit:  Morning Default

### 2009.11.09 – Progress

TIME & PROGRESS
•	Life is structured so I often don’t get time for the most important personal things
•	Worse yet, I am biased away from such thinking/activites
•	More still, I don’t really have a plan when I do get time, so it is frittered easily.

I have the sense that even when I do get time, it gets spent w. little consequence.



RESOLUTION – When personal time is available:
•	I need to organize what I most want to get from the time.
•	Around that I need to build a plan.
•	I need to spiritually ground and connect my reasons for action.
