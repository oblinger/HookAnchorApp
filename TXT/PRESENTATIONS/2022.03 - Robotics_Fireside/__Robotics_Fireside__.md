### TALK ANNOUNCEMENT

Robotics Innovation In The Lab, Gov, Corp, and Startups

We use the narrative stories of Bizzy, Martian, Aeolus Robotics, touch upon Dusty Robotics, Amazon's Astro and DARPA funded work, in order to talk about robotic innovation from several vantage points.

BEST PRACTICES AND ANTI-PATTERNS -- We use these examples to discuss:
- Founding companies, gaining product market fit
- Getting funded (both governmental and investor funding)
- Growing and running larger (40 PhD) R&D robotics teams. 

EXAMPLES OF APPLIED RESEARCH
- Low cost robotics -- approaches for reducing 2 orders of magnitude in cost
- Wiping Research -- Bizzy was a bathroom cleaning robot.  This involved novel on robotic path planning for surface wiping.
- Unconstrained Grasping -- Aeolus was a 'helper' bot, and is required to be able to manipulate found objects in an uncontrolled setting.

ROBOTICS IN THIS NEW REMOTE WORLD — Not just because of covid, technical work is moving towards a planetary teams rather than co-located teams.  As you can imagine this has dramatic consequences for a robotics team.  I setup a 24/7 follow the sun hardware innovation lab.   It kinda worked ;-). Lessons learned and thoughts for the future of robotics.


DAN OBLINGER
The first third of Dan's career was focused on academic research in ML and Programming By Demonstration while at IBM research and teaching in EE at Columbia University.  He then served as a DARPA Program Manager funding over $200M in R&D focused on Human like learning from instruction and Language Understanding, including the work that led to the IBM Watson system beating the Jeopardy-TV-show world champion.  Recently Dan has founded and exited several companies in AI, Robotics and Clean Energy.




### ROSS EMAIL
	
	Ross Email
	Hey Ross,
	
	I am still thinking of this as a kind of fireside chat as we talked about before.
	
	I am a ML-reseracher-entreprenure talking to a bunch of Roboticsts about Robotics.
	My thinking is to lean most heavily into a narrative style focused mostly on the story of martian robotics and Aeolus robotics, but also driving through Analytics Fire and my current acquisition into a Covid disinfecting HW company. And touching on Dusty robotics and maybe even DARPA funded Robotics research if that would be interesting.
	
	THOUGHTS / LESSONS LEARNED
	- Robotics company formation
	- Common startup failures patterns; Key
	- Gaining product/market fit
	- Getting funded (both as a researcher and as entrepreneur)
	- Remote robotics
	- Growing a robotics organization (from builder and applicant perspective)
	- My observations on the state of the jobs market
	- applied wiping
	
	Martian->Aeolus CleanTech->Covid-disinfecting-technology Dusty/Peanut Robotics
	
	Narrative of Bizzy->Martian->Aeolus->Peanut
	Founding/Funding/Scaling
	Remote robotics
	Jobs in 2022
	
	Jonathan Heurst
	Ravi Subermanian - tendon reconstruction
	
	4-min  Marriott Ct downtown; hilton garden;  
	10am-11:30am
	
	
	To keep myself organized I am producing several topic slides that I can flash at appropriate points in the narrative.  I plan to let the audience see an overview slide at the front of the talk so they can pull me to that spot if it looks like we are going to run out of time.
	
	And I am scowering my old emails and hard drive for slides of the robots in progress, but I don't really own that IP any longer, so the pickings will be slim.  All of the video from CES is in the public domain, so for that part I will have good video coverage.  It would be great if I am set up where I can easily manipulate audio-video output from a laptop, which I leave blank until needed.
	
	I have still not bought my plane tickets.  (Kayak says tickets are projected to get cheaper over the next days.)  I am 70% sure I am going to be there in person, but I am still working out if it will conflict with company sale actions that I cannot move.
	
	I will confirm the in-person/remote aspect in the next days.  And would like to show you a draft of the slides a few days in advance, just so you can make some last minute suggestions.
	
	Looking forward,
	Dan

### ROSS EMAIL 1
  
Across two companies, I worked on several versions of this robot with a 40+ PhD team of roboticists.  And my current company is in the process of getting acquired by a hardware company too.  Off of the top of my head, here are some topics that might be of interest:  
  
  
WIPING RESEARCH — The first company was a bathroom cleaning robot. Novel work on surface wiping that I was involved in at a technical level. translating arbitrary 3D surfaces into 2D developing wiping plans then translating back to 3D for execution.  
  
LOW COST ROBOTICS — The "rosy the robot" dream of personal general purpose home robots can only be realized by a two order magnitude drop in the cost of robotic system. We had ideas about how do to this, and I talk at a general level about these ideas, and provides some "war stories" from those attempts.  
  
BUILDING A 40-PHD ROBOT OS — The second company in particular was a pretty big effort — and done on a dramatically shortened timeframe.  Perhaps talking at both a social and technical level about that effort.

I think that might be of interest to the audience as I think these kinds of hybrid approaches are the wave of the future.  
  
STARTUPS — As a serial technical founder I have thoughts about how one needs to think about oneself in order to play that game.

Rather than go deep on one of them, it might generate more interest for me to cover several in rapid succession?


Let me know your thoughts.

Materials:
I have some videos, and a few slides, but most IP is not mine to show... but I am a good speaker.   I would mostly have a outline hand full of content slides, but then just be speaking the talk.  is ok?
My PhD is in Machine Learning, not Robotics.  I did architect the first version of the system, and hired world class Roboticst, but mostly my story would be spoken from the point of view of a leader leading this effort, rather than a researcher developing the tech.

Possible directions for the talk:
WIPING RESEARCH
The first company was a bathroom cleaning robot.  Novel work on surface wiping that I was involved in at a technical level.  translating arbitrary 3D surfaces into 2D developing wiping plans then translating back to 3D for execution.
Steric constraint failures.
Pad dispenser design
LOW COST ROBOTICS
The "rosy the robot" dream of personal general purpose home robots can only be realized by a two order magnitude drop in the cost of robotic system.
We had ideas about how do to this, and I talk at a general level about these ideas, and provides some "war stories" from those attempts.

ROBOTICS IN THIS NEW REMOTE WORLD
For pragmatic reasons I was required to build a 100% remote organization and use it to build our robot.
