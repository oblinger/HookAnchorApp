	Ross Email
	Hey Ross,
	
	I am still thinking of this as a kind of fireside chat as we talked about before.
	
	I am a ML-reseracher-entreprenure talking to a bunch of Roboticsts about Robotics.
	My thinking is to lean most heavily into a narrative style focused mostly on the story of martian robotics and Aeolus robotics, but also driving through Analytics Fire and my current acquisition into a Covid disinfecting HW company. And touching on Dusty robotics and maybe even DARPA funded Robotics research if that would be interesting.
	
	THOUGHTS / LESSONS LEARNED
	- Robotics company formation
	- Common startup failures patterns; Key
	- Gaining product/market fit
	- Getting funded (both as a researcher and as entrepreneur)
	- Remote robotics
	- Growing a robotics organization (from builder and applicant perspective)
	- My observations on the state of the jobs market
	- applied wiping
	
	Martian->Aeolus CleanTech->Covid-disinfecting-technology Dusty/Peanut Robotics
	
	Narrative of Bizzy->Martian->Aeolus->Peanut
	Founding/Funding/Scaling
	Remote robotics
	Jobs in 2022
	
	Jonathan Heurst
	Ravi Subermanian - tendon reconstruction
	
	4-min  Marriott Ct downtown; hilton garden;  
	10am-11:30am
	
	
	To keep myself organized I am producing several topic slides that I can flash at appropriate points in the narrative.  I plan to let the audience see an overview slide at the front of the talk so they can pull me to that spot if it looks like we are going to run out of time.
	
	And I am scowering my old emails and hard drive for slides of the robots in progress, but I don't really own that IP any longer, so the pickings will be slim.  All of the video from CES is in the public domain, so for that part I will have good video coverage.  It would be great if I am set up where I can easily manipulate audio-video output from a laptop, which I leave blank until needed.
	
	I have still not bought my plane tickets.  (Kayak says tickets are projected to get cheaper over the next days.)  I am 70% sure I am going to be there in person, but I am still working out if it will conflict with company sale actions that I cannot move.
	
	I will confirm the in-person/remote aspect in the next days.  And would like to show you a draft of the slides a few days in advance, just so you can make some last minute suggestions.
	
	Looking forward,
	Dan

# SLIDES
## Topics
- Examples:  Bizzy -> Martian -> Aeolus   AnalyticsFire -> Covid Disinfection   
			Dusty Robots.     DARPA  R&D.  
- **Innovation**: In-Lab; GovFunded; BigCorp; InStartup
- **Startups**: Formation, Fit, Funding, Hiring, Growth
- **Applied Research**: Wiping
- Getting Jobs / Funding


## Bizzy
- Pre-money prototype, manually coded inverse kinematics on an arduino
	- DREAM: super low cost haptic cleaner bot ()

## Martian
- $1M -- bath cleaning robotic prototype

## Aeolus
- xxx

## Jobs and Funding
- Very hot job market in 2021.  Its a bit cooler now, but still hot.



### Low cost robotics
- gear boxes, mass produced low resolution joint encoders,
- Jetson TX3 - arm processor with GPU
- $50

### Wiping Research

- Mapping 3d point clouds onto a mesh
- Mapping the mesh onto a plane, doing 2D wipe planning including crevice heuristics, then translating these back into 3D haptic feedback plans


### Job Market


### 


### TOPICS OVERVIEW

- Wiping Research - 
- Shift towards remote work - 
- Job Market - 





Across two companies, I worked on several versions of this robot with a 40+ PhD team of roboticists.  And my current company is in the process of getting acquired by a hardware company too.  Off of the top of my head, here are some topics that might be of interest:


WIPING RESEARCH — The first company was a bathroom cleaning robot. Novel work on surface wiping that I was involved in at a technical level. translating arbitrary 3D surfaces into 2D developing wiping plans then translating back to 3D for execution.


LOW COST ROBOTICS — The "rosy the robot" dream of personal general purpose home robots can only be realized by a two order magnitude drop in the cost of robotic system.  We had ideas about how do to this, and I talk at a general level about these ideas, and provides some "war stories" from those attempts.

BUILDING A 40-PHD ROBOT OS — The second company in particular was a pretty big effort — and done on a dramatically shortened timeframe.  Perhaps talking at both a social and technical level about that effort.


ROBOTICS IN THIS NEW REMOTE WORLD — Not just because of covid, technical work is moving towards a planetary teams rather than co-located teams.  As you can imagine this has dramatic consequences for a robotics team.  I setup a 24/7 follow the sun hardware innovation lab.   It kinda worked ;-). I think that might be of interest to the audience as I think these kinds of hybrid approaches are the wave of the future.

STARTUPS — As a serial technical founder I have thoughts about how one needs to think about oneself in order to play that game.


Rather than go deep on one of them, it might generate more interest for me to cover several in rapid succession?


Let me know your thoughts.

Cheers, 
Dan





Materials:
I have some videos, and a few slides, but most IP is not mine to show... but I am a good speaker.   I would mostly have a outline hand full of content slides, but then just be speaking the talk.  is ok?
My PhD is in Machine Learning, not Robotics.  I did architect the first version of the system, and hired world class Roboticst, but mostly my story would be spoken from the point of view of a leader leading this effort, rather than a researcher developing the tech.

Possible directions for the talk:
WIPING RESEARCH
The first company was a bathroom cleaning robot.  Novel work on surface wiping that I was involved in at a technical level.  translating arbitrary 3D surfaces into 2D developing wiping plans then translating back to 3D for execution.
Steric constraint failures.
Pad dispenser design
LOW COST ROBOTICS
The "rosy the robot" dream of personal general purpose home robots can only be realized by a two order magnitude drop in the cost of robotic system.
We had ideas about how do to this, and I talk at a general level about these ideas, and provides some "war stories" from those attempts.
BUILDING A 40-PHD ROBOT OS

ROBOTICS IN THIS NEW REMOTE WORLD
For pragmatic reasons I was required to build a 100% remote organization and use it to build our robot.
24/7 follow the sun HARDWARE innovation.
STARTUPS
What do you bring that others don't have?
What is your team missing?  Leader in the customer space.
