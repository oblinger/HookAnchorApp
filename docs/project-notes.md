I want to create a new capabilities that we are going to call "patch" which stands for dispatcher.
- Rename 'Group' in the command to be "Patch" which stands for "Dispatcher".  Be sure to update the code and GUI everywhere with this new field name.
- After commands are loaded we should create a hashmap from each lowercase patch namestring onto a new struct called a Patch.
- Each Patch struct has a field 'command' that points to first command whose name matches the patch name.
