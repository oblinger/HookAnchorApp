> It just depends, what you would like to create next in your career and what ypur timeline would be.
> Would you want to be a ___position___ at a ___company/ied___ by ___month and year___?


Joe/Deep,
My long term plan of using my 40+ person consulting company as a lifestyle business has been up-ended by this chance to sell it for a chunk of a fast rising former client company.  It is going to take me some time to settle on my new life path.

Both of you have shown early evidence of helping me gain clairity in comments and challenges to me.  So I am happy to have you along for the ride of me "getting a clue."  But I also respect your desire for me to "already have a clue" so it is also possible that you would tell me to "come back when you can better frame your path."  Both options seem viable to me.


Joe asked:
> Would you want to be a ___position___ at a ___company/ied___ by ___month and year___?

ANSWER:
I would like to be an advisor/EIR at a Venture/PE firm by July-Dec of 2022.


DETAILS:
This is a new and tentative idea.  Prior I had been assuming my options were: (1) be a CTO, (2) join a FAANG, or (3) start my own.  But Deep's advisor role seems spot on; I need to learn directly from those who are doing this job in order to verify this new thought.  Also finding that job sounds like finding a snowflake with the right shape in a storm, but I am game if it can be done!


WHEN:  July-Oct 2022
- For the right opportunity I would bend earlier or later than this window.
- My business sale and company wind-down will be complete by July-1
- Not sure how much I need to worry about looking "stale" if I get hired too many months after this.  Financially I am not constrained in the short run, and I am very productively using this time now, on several life projects.

WHERE:  Reasonably funded activities
- My opportunity cost is a $500K+ FAANG job that utilizes my PhD in Machine Learning.  This is hot right now, and it makes little sense for me to be operating at massively below this rate.  (That said, I am a gambler by nature, so if the expected ROI was large, but mostly built into risky equity, I would do it as long as the expected time frame for payout was not much larger than 5 years.)

WHAT:
- Leading efforts to prototype AI systems with significant technical risk.
- Ideally building a range of AI prototypes.  This is not a hard requirement, but Deep is right on the money, I love to dive fast and deep into hard tech areas that are adjacent to my own expertise.  
- My strengths are centered on rapid abilty to:  
	(1) identify crux to solve;  (2) hire/sturcture teams to solve them; (3) propose detailed technical approaches; (3) eval technical approaches; 
	(4) lead and monitor the prototyping activities.


~~~
I have a couple of direct connections that are in the venture world, I think my first step is to just talk with them about this idea.  And I have an exploration thread that are not even listed above, so it is going to be some time before my new path becomes clear.

Thanks for the help so far, and looking forward to our next chat!
--Dan

### 2021.11.04 - FINE - Dreaming big with Google


SUMMARY of KM + GOOGLE
- PROJ: Before joining, Uniform/KM IP is established as a stand alone project
- JOIN: I join Google based on my AI/ML/Leadership background
- SOCIALIZE: I socialized and refine: uniform, marketplace, treesheet ideas
- PROTOTYPE: Using weekends & salary I build a treesheets prototype
- COMMUNITY: Grow a small community of users/contributors that use treesheets for their own information management.
- LICENCING: Create some 'arms length' licencing to satisfy google&community
- INSIDE GOOGLE: 
	- TEAM: Find team focused on KM or has a relevant tool 
	- 20%: Build 20% time project bridging their tool to treesheets/uniform
	- PROJECT: Upgrade this into Google KM project that cements google docs/sheets as bedrock for this KM tech
	- Outside community grows using both internal and external code
- LEAVE GOOGLE?: seems that really growing this community might force me to get external funding, or just too much work 'outside the tent'?



OWNERSHIP
For several reasons I would like to ownership of some core of the KM ideas:
- I spent years working on them, it feels right to in some way own them
- My largest dream is they serve as the nucleus for a free community


CARVED OUT IP -- Coming into Google I have already carved out several pieces of IP, so that their ownership is clear and separated.  Further Google has agreed that I am able to continue work on this body of technology while at Google.  These pieces of tech include:
- UNIFORM - A ecosystem of computational elements.
- TREESHEETS - A knowlege management framework.
- MARKETPLACE - The idea of marketplace that seeks to maximize value transferred (measured both from the perspective of the contributor and the consumer.)
- CODE MARKDOWN - A language independent code format.


LICENCING TERMS -- 
- In order to extend the work while at Google I wonder if make the code open source will facilitate this action.
- I want to licence the IP in a way that allows it to be used as a basis of a marketplace, thus it would need to be 



THE PROTOTYPE
Before (or after?) joining google I have developed this technology to a point where it has basic connection to google docs and google sheets, and is able to be used (as a demonstration prototype) to automatically synchronize data across these

TRUTHS:
- TIRED - Part of resistance to day job stems from a feeling of 'tireness'.  Just don't want to work hard, don't feel my health is what it was, don't feel avaiable time is what it was.  
- WASTE - Don't want all my time absorbed into effort I am not motivated by
- ABILITY - Feel my abilities are not as they were, especially w less effort



MASTERY
- Technical Leader in AI
- Visionary ability to think far outside the box regarding societal problems
- Carrying the torch of an idea





Using Google as platform for KM

TIME - It is likely that I can arrange for 10-20hrs per week to work on KM separate from my Google 'day job'

OWNERSHIP - It is likely that I can arrange to OWN key IP around Uniform, Marketplace, and Treesheets, so that continued extension of that work will remain owned by me.

VALIDATION - It is possible that I will have time to validate aspects of the treesheet idea while I am at Google -- this will take years to do, but should work if I can keep focus for that time.

### 2021.10.27 - FINE journal

Dan, I am really in a dark place.  Woke at 4am and could not sleep.  Just gripped by fear and dread.  Without discussing it here, lets just say that the KM idea seems it wont be a workable path.

I have always organized my life around my side projects.  Others played on the weekends, and this is what I did.  The idea to turn one of these into something consequential as quite a draw, and caused me to organized even more around the project with time pressures forced things to drop away.  I am not engaged in nor motivated by much of anything.

At this stage I feel very trapped.  Family obligations absorb my time in activities that do have their high points, but are mostly things that I am happy to be done with when I can be done.  I don't think I am constructed like most parents in the way that I get joy.  And likely the feeling that I have signed on for never-ending labor until I am beyond retirement does not help.

Work is similar.  I am orgaized around building things, so work can definitely have its high points, and can be absorbing at times.  Like my home life, it could be a great secondary thing that I have to do, but a 'have to do' that brings some sense of fullfillment and purpose, as long as it is just a smaller side thing.

But there is no main thing!  Nothing to work towards, except more work.
I just feel tired of life.  not grateful at an emotional level.  And trapped... until I am too old.


~~~~~~~~~
PRIDE: How much pride are you taking in this passion or virtue around Knowledge Management?

Definitely my sense of identity and differentiation is centered on my ability to think and to create.  And among others like me, I am further differentiated my drive to identify out-of-the-box to address an age old problems in a transformatively different way.

But I would say my drive to do this is greater than my pride in doing it.  I feel the jury is still out on the ultimate value of those abilities.  Still that does not stop me from trying to assess them myself.  My assessments are all over the map.  At a base level I see competence there, but perhaps a  misguided competence.  At the highest level I a see transformative outputs that would be written in history books.  

I think sense of identity is perhaps the best way to say it.
And more pride in this area than nearly any other area in my life.


~~~~~~
NERDLAND:  What’s your judgment/ relationship or perspective to entering “Nerdland”?

I was picked on in my farm town for being a nerdly sort.  My response was to embrace the title, and kind of make fun of myself.

Later it was far easier to have the nerd title with it having a more positive connotation.  I would say I do take pride in that title now, and I wear it easily now.

That is, I am not very offended when it is teased, and I tend to make self deprecating 'nerd' jokes when appropriate, but at the same time no one is confused to think that I am not also prideful of and fully owning that status too.

my current world is pretty "pro nerd" so it is less of a thing these days.. it just is.



~~~~~~
POEM:

In 9th grade I realized my father's pragmatic view of life (which seem logical to me) would lead to a very barren life, so I expressly cultivated an interest and joy in as many things as I could.  This worked! over years I really came to value many diverse things.  Mostly work, but also my side projects over the years after 40 really started eroding this.  At 56 my life matches the stanza of the poem quite well.

run away from sensible advice 

In a way the last 10 years have been a half hearted attempt to do just that.
half-hearted since I did do sensible things along the way.
but after the robotics company (for a solid year) I really did run from sensible advice with a chunk of my time... it was wonderful, then in the second year became disillusioned and needed to focus on my regular job too.

### 2021.10.27 - FINE passion questions / KM trajectory
No matter what work I do I will want to have a dan-project, either as my main project or a side project.


1. What activities have the most meaning to you in your personal life?
Self-directed technical creation work.
Taking Eli to swim class 
Talking with friends

2. What do you most enjoy talking about... What topics could you talk about for hours on end?
Many technical ideas.  Ideas that are about AI-consciousness, Societal problems and solutions, Knowlege management & sharing.  But really any thing where there is a novel idea for a solution.

3. What are the situations and activities when time seems to fly by and you lose yourself in what you’re doing?
In self-directed creation work.  Focused on the interesting parts, done at pace and timings when I am most motivated for it.

4. What activities make you feel most like yourself?
Technical creation.
Alone in nature.
Teaching or directing on a subject where I have mastery.

5. What fascinates you that you want to continue learning about?
Every 'thing' is pretty in interesting.  How the federal reserve banks actually perform their quantitive easing.  How the new corona mRNA vaccine works. etc.
When presented the opportunity I will ususally learn it.
But I am only driven to seek out learning when I need it for some project I am doing...  otherwise it is undirected.


6. What do you do in your spare time? Volunteering?
Hack on one of my projects. (when I am excited by it)
Watch TV or read a book (when I am not)
[I used to do many other things, but most require pre-allocated time]

7. If you were going to write a book about something, what would you write about? 
A detailed technical account of how human consciousness comes about, written as a sci-fi...  It it told from the perspective of an emerging consciousness who learns that infact they were created as a kind of weapon that one AI is using to understand its adversary AI.  Thus our protagonist learns all of his friends from childhood are actually the enemies of "his people" and are trying to use him to understand and be able to defeat them.


8. What have you been continually drawn to over the course of your life?
Learning about things, building things.

Thinking thru novel technical solutions to societal problems.


9. What activities make you feel most alive and engaged?
10.What were your favorite subjects in school?
Math and Science

11.What did you love to do as a child?
Build eletrical gadgets of all sorts.

12.What was your childhood dream?

13.What part of the dream are you currently living out? If you aren't living that dream,
why aren't you?
14.A lot of super smart people like Malcom Gladwell say that it takes 10,000 hours to
master something. What kinds of things (even if they aren’t necessarily career
related) would you willfully choose to spend 10,000 hours doing?
15.What would you do with your time if you didn’t need to work to make money?


Push one or two of my many ideas to become reality.
Continue thinking thru many ideas in more effective ways engaging with others more earlier in my process.

### 2021.07.04 - Doug conversation

BIG Q:
- Is KMCO real?
- Want Google over Visio anyway?

ASSUMPTIONS:
- TECH-LEAD -- Many tech+leadership jobs fit dan in a general kind of way.
- RARE-DAN -- VERY few will fit Dan in a work-weekends-for-free kind of way.
				- Only long term one w/ maybe enough cash is Uniform
				- Go low-or-high.  Hobby time, or near pefect hit.
					Problem fits dan perfectly. job title allows working on it


ALTERNATIVES
- ?++ GOOG:	Can work less, good money/security, less ownership
- ??? KMCO:  Unicorn-level Time & Energy
- ??- VISIO:	Visio>Google on freetime longterm?  (Loose KMCO chance)
		Visio>Google ownership.  Google>Visio on tech?  Know in 1yr.
		Google wins on $$, but would in year if VISIO is acceptable.
					
- --- NO LIFESTYLE BIZ: AF is dead, any investors will want a unicorn 	
		trajectory, any biz (even lifestyle) will require 40++ hours per week for a long time.
- ??- CONSULT CO: Seems "mailing it in" at google would be easier and more 	
		rewarding and pay more than consult co.  But could work some.
- ?-- DAN CO: The only potentially viable DANCO seems to be a KMCO above
- ?-- BAT CO: Building any business that dan would not work on for free on his  
		weekends is a BAT CO.  Since lifestyle biz is dead, then Bat Co has a unicorn trajectory, thus it will leave very little room for hobby time.  So don't do it, if it is not a DanCO you are only gaining some ownership over a Google job, but loosing massive certainty and some freetime.

PATH #1 KMCO -- Shoot for KM, but prep for Google
- **_Love_** thinking Uniform/KM thoughts.
- KM space is saturated with others; Incumbents hold the high ground
- Must chase customer's problems, not uniform.  Must be CEO not CTO to start
- would be fun if it worked.
	==> Spend time trying to find KM (Uniform) related startup
	==> Spend time, preping for Google job and building Uniform HOBBY stuff

PATH #2 - Join VISIO
- Spend most time making Visio succeed
- Spend time on KM as hobby


OBSERVATIONS

VISIO 75% SUCKS -- 75% of VISIO cases worse than Google; 
	and 40% are quite bad after a multi-year delay, but 50% are close to Google
- BREAKDOWN -- Here is a slightly optomistic breakdown
		25% Fast fail (<18 mo)  25% Slow fail (<4 yr)  25% Ok growth  25% strong
		20% tech fails; 30% market kills us; 25% ok growth; 25% strong growth
- FACTORS -- Proven demand.  Available customer segments.  Super founder-ish.
	Tech is hard, but not too hard.  Pre-A-round (at A-round it is 10% success)

VISIO NO FERRIS LIFESTYLE -- Unlike my own startup, VISIO is unlikely to transition into longterm lifestyle.
- At 5M/yr w. certainty my own startup can give 500K/yr w. little work as CEO
- at 20M/yr VISIO would likely still not give that for ferris-level work

VISIO PART TIME IS OK -- Both now and in the future, it is likely I can work part time at Visio

VISIO AFTER A YEAR I WOULD KNOW
- Tech would be resolved; first market would have lots of evidence

VISIO REGRET MINIMIZATION
- 25% 1st yr fail -- I would have preferred google
- 25% 4yr fail -- I would have preferred google
- 20% strong co -- I happy I went w Visio
- 30% medium co -- 60/40 18%/12% I would prefer google to visio
	==> 68% prefer google.  32% prefer visio.  
	==> But I can jump to google, but not jump to visio
	==> Reason for Visio is Freetime.  after 2 years, I need it less 

VISIO: Stacking risks
- 25% Founder frustrations
- 25% Tech failure
- 30% Market failure (others take it from us, etc.)
	==> Result 40% success


AF-KMCO AFTER TWO YEARS
- 25% chance of gaining funding on UF-info; UF-ML; UF-mkt
- 20% chance of getting a google job related to this work

UF AFTER N-YEARS
- Best shot for UF is AF-KMCO.  
	More time on it; explicitly connecting to problems


KMCO -- What are the chances that a concerted effort would yield a viable target
- OTHER CO CTO -- CTO w. >150K salary and >1.5% of 100M.  hard: 50+hrs/wk
	Relevant to KM, but not really following a Dan idea


RISKS
- KMCO is riskier than VISIO - SuperFounder; Vision hardtech pivots; 5 dev-yrs

### 2021.07.01 - notes

WANT FREEDOM -- I to get wrapped up in a Dan project from time to time, and feel I have time to really drive it somewhere.  For the moment, that is Uniform, but later it will be something else.

In the early days, Visio will afford more freedom that Google, or MyCo
Working for AF will provide the greatest freedom.


LOVE DESIGNING SYSTEMS - I will rat hole in working out the details for some new idea for a thing.  What is key is that is it mostly from my brain.  Sure I will research background materials, but the love is the thinking it thru.

FINISH IT - Really want to finish a Dan-thing.  But they tend to grow in size.  Taking the step to launch it gets pushed off.

CEO-DAN - does not seem like the life I want.

GENERIC-MYCO - Could be good lifestyle some distance into the future, but it seems too distant and uncertain to count on it.

MAIN COMPARISON NOW -- Is between MyAttempt and Visio?

VISIO, FLAKIER & EASIER -- I have a sense that Visio could be easier than other startup roles, so I am pulled to it.

IF I DONT GO -
- Spend 1-year hacking; then join google
- 6-months; then BATCO

DanCo(KmCo) - Is likely a struggle since it beings from my interests; over explored space; big platforms win


Actualizing Job - Can I find a paying job that will really resonate with me?



Am I really going to have 15 guys?  doing a friends and family round?


QUESTIONS FOR DOUG:
-- side projects;

### 2021.06.30 - Alternatives

Most Likely:  
-- 1.5y Fiddle --> Google   (-->BatCo, -->DanCo)
-- 1y Visio --> 5y Stay | Google

Top Choices:  Google; Visio; BatCo  ?Scientist  Lesser: DanCo(KmCo) GAI, MyCo
Want: Freetime, IdeaExpansion(API,etc.), TechLead
Question:  ActualizingJob


KMCO IS A LONG SHOT -- KM space is very crowded w big money, and entrenched solutions.

BATCO less fun than VISIO -- except after 4 years?




VISIO > GOOGLE  (assuming money is the same)
	can always leave Visio.   more freedom/time, more ownership, as technical

VISIO > MYCO
	For most CEO roles I will be saddled with lots of work & non-technical work
	Might yield a larger payout, but it will be 8+ years out

GAI trails below others -- less cash.

NO MYCO LIFESTYLE -- The idea that I am going to create new business and grow it  into a Ferris lifestyle biz is not a sensible or likely path.

DANCO BUMP -- Starting from a technical idea I love could give a bump in joy of doing work.  But it would be modest, since most activites and choices would still be driven by customer.

CEO GAP -- I have a gap in being a CEO from a decision making perspective.

TECH > MARKETING -- I love solving hard technical problems rather than hard branding / marketing problems.


GAI SAFETY -- A soft money position; maybe for a year or 2, but no way to live
GAI BUILD IT -- Just be a DARPA PM, or join Google Brain, or Open AI


WHAT I WANT
- FREEDOM
- BUILDING a TECHNICAL thing.
- CTO role > CEO role  -- not as technical.  too much work. can't lifestyle


KEY
- DANCO / DANJOIN -- Built around a 'Dan' idea
- MYCO -- A company that I build
- BATCO -- My company built around customer driven problem

### 2021.06.29 - Jason Redux


Terms:
-- IP owned by Dan except sports-vision related
-- 22.5% Equity for 3/4 time
-- AF HOURS.  4% equity for 1000hours of AF time.

-- SALARY -- No pay for year 1 and year 2, ramping up in year three depending on health of business.  Year four should be at full pay assuming business is strong.




~~~~
$10M max after tax into Dan's pocket, additional monies must go to a charitable trust or in some way go to charity.  
-- This should be a legal agreement between Dan and Jason, and not tied to Dan's equity, so Dan can exercise the equity as needed before a full exit.
(I don't expect this to be large money, but rather a stipend if I am trying to do something after Visio, but before visio exits.)
-- Still Dan should give Jason's charity first right of refusal on any monies he pulls in this way.


$10M max into Dan's pocket.
The aim here is to ensure that if Visio hits big, that the lion's share of Dan's slice goes into some charity work that Dan feels best about.  But many things can happen so legally encumbering Dan's equity is not the best idea.  Instead Dan and Jason sign a contract limiting cash that goes unencombered into Dan's pocket.  In addition to this the expectation is that Dan in good faith is going to try to maximize the output of all of his equity.  So, for example if he sold future rights to the equity for lesser present value, he would offer an opportunity to Jason and his trust to buy those shares to maximize value from them.  (Presently, the main ways this seems it would happen is cases where Dan wanted to ramp down Visio time and persue other things using Visio monies, PRIOR to a Visio exist.  In these cases it seems now, that he would NOT want to sacrifice pennies on the dollar in early cashout, and would only want to take what was needed to live.  but who knows what the future brings...)

### 2021.05.31 - Nick Text Response
Some bullet point thoughts:

**DIFFERENT SITUATION** -- Before marriage I had 'infinite' time with a growing net worth each month.  After marriage in 2018, I told my brother I was "retired-ish".  With 2.5M in the bank earning the equivelant of a $150K/yr interest salary, and my aim to get AF salary over $100K I figured that would cover things, so any additional cash from other adventures would just sweeten the pot.
==> In this context I was looking for anything of value to do.  Now I am considering what is the _last_ direction I will try.
==> Not saying this was a wise path, just explaining the vast difference in risk tolerance.  I married thinking AF would probably work -- but it didn't.

	
**DEEPLY WANT** -- What is it that I deeply want?
- SYSTEMS THINKING -- I am drawn towards a certain kind of "systems thinking" where I step outside how some problem is attacked today and introduce a very different approach and think it thru at at technical level.  I am compelled to just **DO** this all the time.  This is not the most efficient since each is ambitious and I am generally not in position to execute.  
	==> If I didn't need to worry for income, I would have loved to kick off several non-profit-ish things.
	==> Now making just ONE of these my lifes work would be cool, if:
- MANAGING TECHNICAL EXECUTION -- The other thing I seem drawn to is management of technical execution.  Very hands on, but above the level of an individual contributor.
- DAN IDEA -- There are a tiny minority of ideas which seem pretty unique to me.  Other ideas are interesting but will happen with or without me.
	Thus I am extra compelled by Dan ideas.  These include:
		Uniform (KM or Data Pipes), PopulationProcessor, Forum, EduCorp 


**PERSUING MY INTESETS IN A DIRECT WAY**
- PAST ACTION -- I don't think I have been very strategic in persuit of my interests.  Rather I am always looking for interesting problems to consider, and I consider them at two levels:  (1) pencil paper design.  (2) ground up implementation.

NO TO JASON


Finally I am rejecting the Jason possibility in my mind.  Why?
  
-- LAST CHANCE -- Now is my chance to chase a big idea...  Visio will derail me for at least 4 years, even then I am very flat footed to chase a big idea, since I have not make much money.  It is just saying "No" to any big idea.

-- LAZY -- The Visio path might have a modest 'lazy' advantage.  I would love the freedom to work w/o salary demands, but this would likely not be the case at visio.  Perhaps I could get an extra 5-10 hours per week free from my day job, but being junior at Visio, I could not really drive a strongly unconstrained time.

-- EQUIV TECH TO GOOGLE - I want to work heads down on some technical mission.  Likely I could do this better inside a tech company like Google.  I likely could jump between different ML tasks providing value to them, maybe in a way that would at least rival the diversity I would find at Visio.

-- WATER UNDER BRIDGE - Well partly because it is now water under the bridge, I likely cannot pull out a good working relationship given that things have progressed timewise so far.

_
#### 2021.09.14 - DAN-WORK - The kind of conceptual work that drives me
##### _

There is a certain kind of work (lets call in DAN-WORK) and this kind of work is so compelling I tend to work on it even when it is not rational to do so; in to the night; sometimes at expense of nearly anything else.

DAN-WORK = TRANSFORMATIVE, CLEVER/HARD, INTERNALIZED, CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM-SOLVING and MENTORING


CLEVER/HARD
- HARD WORK CAN BE BORING -- work that is just hard, like solving some huge calculus problem is just drudgery.  There are no insights to be found or tricks to play then it is exhausting and not very rewarding
- CLEVER WORK IS TOO RANDOM/QUICK -- work that is just one clever trick has no staying power, in one flash it is over, or you have no ideas and make no progress forever.  
- CLEVER + HARD -- now we are TALKING.  I can play with the right kind of mathematical puzzle for weeks if it is the right shape.


TRANSFORMATIVE
- LIFE MISSION NEEDS CONSEQUENCE -- even if I can play with a hard+clever problem for a long time, it feels hollow.  like binge-watching six seasons of game of thrones in one weekend... it was kinda fun a the time, but also anxiety provoking because you are say...  why the fuck am I doing this?
- A TRANSFORMATION STORY PROVIDES THE ANSWER -- when I can construct a story about how solving this problem will somehow transform things for some group for the better in a significant way, then have no such hollow feeling... it it jet-fuel to work even later into the night!
- SOCIAL -- One common and very satifying way for work to be transformative is for the work to be social in nature, figuring out how society can work better is inherently transformative and hard (if it were easy it would already be done!)


INTERNALIZED
- NO PAPER NEEDED -- the very best problems are ones that can be considered for days or weeks without even needing a piece of paper -- just pure thinking.
- LESS LIBRARY RESEARCH -- I am ok needing to do some background learning in order to attack a problem.  Still this learning, unless it involves learning clever insights is a bit of needed drudgery work, it is not the main course.
- LESS COLLABORATIVE -- I am ok problem solving as part of a team, but I like moving fast, and I like the thrill of the solving itself, thus collaboration can be a bit of a speed bump for all of that.  It is ok, and can even be energizing when my partner is complementary and sharp/fast.


CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM SOLVING
- PROBLEM FRAMING -- Often the most unconstrained (and thus hardest/cleverest) part of solving a problem is properly framing it in a way that it CAN be solved in a good way.  This is very satisfying work.
- EDGE OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL -- Often the at the fringes of what is known and what is properly framed is where the exciting action is at.  It is close enough in that one might make the transformative difference by properly framing the work, but it is not so far in that the proper framing is easily obtained.  Often this work is called "conceptualizing" a problem.  I freaking love it!


MENTORING
- Advising
- Vision -- 
- Details & Tracking & Plodding -- not so much


EXAMPLES OF DAN-WORK:
- BLOCKCHAIN - Building a POS block chain as robust as today's POW chains are
- ELDERBOT - Building an automated human-transport robot for the elderly
- TEAMSAVER - Identifying and overcoming limitations that make remote work less effective than in-person work
- ENGINES-OF-CONTROL - Building a conscious computer
- NANO-SCALE-PROGRAMMABLE-MATTER - How to build programmed 3D-nano structures
- AEOLUS-ROBOT-ARCHITECTURE - Designing the high-level APIs and architecture



NEGATIVE EXAMPLES
- BORING DETAILS - I desperately want to hand off
- POLISHING - Polishing text describing an idea
- MEETINGS - Being in meetings once all the hard stuff is resolved
- TRACKING - Tracking work being done



WHAT MIGHT FIT ME?
- BUSY BEE - helping with the framing & large scale solutioning across many hard tasks.


_
##### 2021.11.21 - NINA WORK

HARD - Trying to prove theorems about privacy is very hard.
DELEGATE - Working with student means they do bulk of the tedious writeup.
EXPERT - Working near experts means that my work is efficient

_
##### - Conceptual Work

I am positively driven to think about 
- the detailed conceptualization of a clever solution to a big-impact problem.
- Love just thinking, 


DONT LOVE
- Don't love doing the library research
- I dread coordinating it.
- I resist doing it on a schedule, or for many hours at a time.
- I dread working on more boring parts.
- I dread working on parts where cleverness is not needed.

_
##### - Technical center
Clear that my work must have a strongly technical center.
Possible centers:
- Applied ML reseracher
- Robotics project lead



- SOLVE -- dig into range of disparate problems and apply deep tech to them
- MENTOR -- Work as mentor to direct technical work to be done
_
##### - Procrastination

- As soon as I work, I resort to procrastination by 
	organizing / processing easy stuff
	- Emails, Medium/Blogs
	- Take Nap (I physically feel sleepy in a quick way)
_
##### - Uniform/Marcel
- IMPORTANCE -- feeling that the idea has potential for large impact
- UNIQUE -- feeling that idea that is not generally known, or solved
- PURE THOUGHT -- Struggling to understand/solve using pure thought
- 
- CLEVER SOLUTION -- 


- EFFICIENT SYSTEM -- love thinking about how to make systems efficient

_
#### 2021.07.31 - The Past and The Future - Summary for Nick

THE PAST
- MISSION #1 -- Achieve some larger-than-self impact from one of my many ideas 
- MISSION #2 -- Spend my time working on diversity of challenging/fun ideas
- SUBGOAL -- Create lifestyle biz needing few hours to support mission 1 & 2
- DIAGNOSIS -- My execution was split & not well informed. Better: do #1 alone
- OUTCOME -- Only some success on #2.  Bit of money & experience too.

THE FUTURE    (analysis of long terms options)
- CONSULTING -- Probably not enough money for long term 
	(maybe on-par w/ google if fulltime, but that would suck more long term)
	(could be used to stretch a medium term situation longer)
- AI SAFETY -- Not enough money for long term; and not a forever mission
- STARTUP -- Too risky to consider now unless I am dying to do it
- LIFESTYLE BIZ -- Too slow & too risky now.  
	Jason's gig is best bet in that direction, but still risky & slow.
- BIG CO -- Likely this is the only real option for long term

THE PRESENT   (medium term window 1-2 years)
- TOP COVER -- Use AF payout as 'top cover' to wife for gap before big co
- TOP COVER -- Get some affiliation as 'top cover' for future employer
- GOAL:
	- ACTUALIZE -- Get stuff 'out of my system' before big co jail
		==> into form where I can claim it as protected IP
	- MOON SHOT -- Take long shot on 


SATISFYING WORK (more items below are better, but not all are required)
- HARD THINKING - Not just execution, solve hard-to-think-thru technical tasks
- CLEVER DETAILS -- 
- HELPS THE WORLD (NOT MOSTLY JUST BIG CO)


EXAMPLE AWESOME TASKS
- TECHNICAL PROBLEM FRAMING -- Hearing about a novel technical challenge, and thinking thru how one might address it at a detailed technical level.
	- e.g. how to model task in order successfully apply ML.
	- e.g. how to architect an approach

#### 2021.07.29 - "New Programming Language" CTO

- Connor@matchstar.com   recruiter  949-689-5969  Carolyne Connor
- Michael Antonov  (former head architect for Occulus)
- Matt Shlosberg (chief of staff)  (443)629-8993  matt@formic.vc


Questions
-- what is the purpose of this language
-- what is the team size now, and within the next year
-- what is the immediate roadmap / longer roadmap
-- should I just grab a coffee with Matt
-- anything I should know or consider about the people involved
	CTO / Built out a team


Matt, 
The opportunity to work with Michael is likely the most unique opportunity I have ever seen, maybe ever.  My interest would entirely hinge on exactly what Michael is attempting to achieve.  If possible I would love our first conversation to be a rather informal one, just to gauge if I might be a good fit for this role, and whether this role might be a good fit for me.  Regardless of what we find, I am sure the connection will be a interesting one, so I am very happy to meet over coffee to learn more.

I don't have an up to date resume, though I am happy to get it up to date and gather relevant materials if we decide a match is possible.  In the mean time, my linked in is pretty close so I will include that.

As this position is quite specific, I think it will save us both time if I layout the ways I do and do not seem to match what I think you are looking for:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieloblinger/


LANGUAGES
- I _**love**_ language design!  Trying to formulate the obvious commonalities spanning modern languages into a single uniform "Ur" langauge has been a passion project for many years.
- In grad school I spent a year focused on formal languages and the building axomic and denotational theories for parallel programming.
- I am a lifelong lisp hacker, this is a beautiful ecosystem where one can invent programming paradigms easily using the meta-object-protocol or simply via funky load time macros.  
- I deeply understand the practical memory-layout & code consequences of languages choices.  (e.g. different tradeoffs w/ different implementations of persistence multiple inheritance, or the ways V8 or PyPy compilers performs JIT type analysis to optomize memory layout for objects.)  I enjoy thinking about how to "push the bubble under the carpet" to provide a best approach to some language feature.


RELEVANT EXPERIENCES 
- At Aeolus Robotics, I was brought in again as a founding CTO.  There I build a team of 60 engineers (40 with very specialized PhDs in various aspects of robotic dexterous manipulation), and delivered a functioning robot into CES within a single year timeframe.  I continued to serve as architect at Aeolus, though the sheer size of the team and our fast growth rate really pulled me increasingly away from the code.  The entire OS was in the many many tens of thoughts of lines of code (likely beyond 100K lines, but I cannot vouch for that with certainty.)
- I co-founded Martian Robotics, where I lead a 13 person engineering team as CTO.  I was also the architect for our Robot OS for an autonomous dexterous robot.
- As a program Manager at DARPA I envisioned, sold, and managed over $200M in R&D prototypes that involved over 500 professors, post docs, grad students and programmers.  Both the Machine Reading program and the Bootstrapped learning programs included >$3M subteam that created the APIs and execution frameworks the teams were required to operate within.  I lead both of these efforts.


RELEVANT SKILLS
- Strong ability to lead a teams under time and scope shift pressures
- Strong ability to hire top talent 
	(even hyper specialists where only dozens exist the world over)
- Strong ability to architect and take stuardship of a deeply technical vision
- Strong ability to ideate with Micheal on language choices...  
	would be a partner and carrier of a vision (that I believed in).
- Strong ability to roadmap pragmatic paths "spiral" optimally to 
	(a) reduce key technical risks and (b) gain world mindshare sooner
- Transformation of software engineering via paradigm shift is a life passion.
- Very fast learner of new, abstract, complex ideas.
- Fast tempo in ideation discussions (and LOVE them!)

I have strengths fomenting consensus around deep architectural choices, and designing APIs, rather than spending my hours coding. In my work at Analytics Fire, Aeolus, and Martin, I was the architect that co-developed the APIs and approach constraints these systems were build upon. So I have even more strengths on the CTO than VP of engineering side.

#### 2021.07.28 - Meeting with Nick and Michael

-- Need for money fucks things up
	-- I SHOULD be accountable to my 'users'
	-- But need to turn $300K plus profit quickly, limit impact & directions
	-- I had it, and I let it go.
	-- On paper I wrote $150K-$400K before marriage.
	-- Mid-stream on two decade idea.  Sad to drop it.
-- Depressed.  anxious.  shell shocked.  Not in a good decision-making frame

Ready to sacrifice all
- Was ready to sacrifice everything be in a spot where my time is spent thinking hard thoughts, in impactful areas, alternating with deep dives into the market to make one connect.
	(not clear I have skills.  I have 3 year attention, but maybe not 10yr)

-- Don't feel I spent last 10 years in an effective way.
	-- Always favored less risky, less motivating paths first, never went beyond
	-- Nearly all attempt were not well formed, or nor well mentored
	-- Whole time were string half attempts, made w/ half conviction,
	-- My aim was lowest risk path to lifestyle, so never reached.
	-- Good evidence that I do operate very differently given different context 

-- Nick says
	-- Lack conviction to drive in a single direction.  True.
		But that is because multiple directions are all acceptable
	-- Perhaps too late to take on the risk of a startup 
	-- All have significant risks

1. Make a decision tree of the choices you are evaluating & probably outcomes
2. Score the outcomes based on 3-5 metrics you care about
3. Assign probability to the outcomes
4. Talk to like 5 people in the know & ask them for feedback. They will probably give you feedback that updates the tree, especially around probability, but maybe also sanity checks about what it’s like

### 2021.09.22 - >>> WP    -- NEXT JOB ACTIVITIES <<<
#### 2021.10.01 - -- SITUATION SUMMARY --

The business I own is going to transition (in a good way) soon, so I need to select my next adventure.

I need to understand the realism of some paths I am considering.
My enthusiasm for a job can be quite hot or cold based on details of that job, so I need to strategize to craft a good path.


=== BACKGROUND ===

**MY SITUATION**
- I have leadership experience and Phd in: AI/Machine Learning/Robotics.
- The company I founded will transition, so I need a new gig.

**PRIOR PLAN**
- **BIG-DIFFERENT** -- think thru secondary problems around central insight
- **JUST-DO-ONE** -- 
- **LIFESTYLE INCOME** -- Obtain moderate/sufficient lifestyle income, then persue realization of ideas based on impact, not based on income potential.
- **HALF-EFFORTS** -- 
- **PATH NOW IN DOUBT** -- Marriage, Child, Bay area costs, Business transition all cast this plan into grave doubt.

**COGNITIVE DISSONANCE**
- **EMPERORS-NEW-CLOTHES** -- Verbal, Deep, Fast, Broad, 
	Depth-to-avoid-Bordom, Flighty/Slow/Sprinter, TooVerbose/Complex, 
	Execution Exp, Too willing to express Negative
- **GROWN-LAZY** -- 

**POSSIBLE PATHS FORWARD**
- **KMCO** -- Start my own company based in knowledge management.
- **FAANG** -- Well paid AI guy in a big co (as manager or individual contributor)
- **CTO** -- Several opportunies are in front of me.

**MY PASSION PROJECT**
- **10+ YRS OF HEAVY SIDE WORK** -- An approach for socially constructed software
- **KNOWLEGE MANAGEMENT STARTUP** -- Side work could provide basis for a startup
- **THREE SEPERABLE SIDES TO THIS PASSION**
	- UNIFORM -- An technical approach for building interoperable SW languages
	- KM -- A Knowlege management product for used by individuals&corporations
	- MKT -- A marketplace that maximizes participant pay not capital profits

**ABOUT ME**
- **ALWAYS IDEATING / SHORT ON EXECUTION** -- By far the KM thread is deepest of all my interests, but my M-O is to forever consider societal problems, and try to find a key insight to break the impasse then flesh the insight out towards a solution.  I will go VERY (way too) deep in considering if ...  how this new solution might operate.  Most excited when I feel I have hit upon some _**novel insight**_ leverage on a long standing problem.  Such insights do not come at command, they come randomly, thus these interest are extremely randomly distributed, (and not that tied to my area of training).
	==> My (and other's) assessment is that these ideas are novel and valuable,
		yet the overall outcome is negligable w/o followup execution.
- **IDEAS ARE BIG / HARD TO MONETIZE** -- feel my largest contributions would happen if I need not try to simultaneouly earn personal money from projects.
- **OTHER EXAMPLE IDEAS**
	- **EDUCORP** -- Self-funded education & business ownership for the very poor
	- **TEAMSAVER** -- Remote-work with in-person like interpersonal connectivity
	- 

**FINANCIAL NEEDS**
- **MONEY IN THE BANK** -- Have saved couple million that provide 6-figure salary
- **IN BAY AREA W/ NEW BABY** -- But I live in bay area with a young kid and a wife working at Google, but expecting private schools etc.
- WAS EXPLICIT BEFORE MARRIAGE --

KEY CONSIDERATIONS
- FREEDOM: 
- ENGAGEMENT:		
- PAY:		


**FREEDOM**
- **MULTIPLE** -- Idea of working on only one goal for years feels limiting.
	Want to work on multiple ideas, and follow where they lead, not the money.
- **FOLLOW** -- Ideas not money.  Sometimes importance and money align, and that is great.  But when they don't it is great to ignore the money.
- **SOCIETAL VALUE** -- Ability to work on ideas that w. outsized societal impact
- **NON MEGA CORP** -- Have impact; not primarily/entirely on a corp bottom line
- **TOP EDGE** -- Top edge of my technical ability to operate
- **UNIQUE TO ME** -- ``first reaction should be.  Huh, what?   That is dumb!   or That wont work''
- **CAT PERSON** -- Great joy in choosing tempo / timing of work.  Tend to "get religion" about topic and work frantically.  Other times it is pulling teeth

==> Such freedom is likely too much to ask.  Just want a chunk of it per day/wk


JOB ENGAGEMENT
- Technical Vision Leader -- Spending hours refining and presenting a technical vision.
- Puzzle pieces -- I enjoy thinking how to fit some complex pieces together.  
- Talking -- I enjoy presenting and talking about idea.
- Ownership -- Feeling like a own a thing matters
- Value -- Feeling that the work I do actually matters to the world


JOB DRUDGERY
- Have to do it now -- When I have to do a thing, even a thing I really want to do, it generates significant resistance.
- Tedious Activities -- Low brain usage activities that are 'too slow' are really frustrating




TECH LEAD
- HARD -- Some part of the task is technically difficult
- DESIGN -- Building APIs, Architectures
- LEAD -- Some aspect of team leading


IMPACT






DRIVERS
- COOL TECH - Spend good fraction of day working on cool tech
- EGO/IMPACT - 
- COULD OWN IT - In principle I could own part of what I produced



COOL TECH
- Based on thinking long about a tough problem
- Innovations I can imagine w/o pencil and paper
- 

Thinking

- Want job w/o tons of daily requirements
- Want to work on technical & important stuff

##### - Mindmap for IN FLOW
_
##### 2021.05.06 - WORK VIEW

	Work is the technical building of value:

	- OWNERSHIP -- 
		- BUILDING -- I am organized around the idea of _building_ things--BUILDING a THING that has tangible value for some 'customer' community
		- LEADERSHIP -- Having some vision/leadership scope fits best w/ my personality.

	- TECHNICAL DEPTH -- Somewhere in my life there needs to be some hard problem solving going on.  Work is a very natural place to find this activity.

	- IMPACT
		- JUSTIFICATION -- To myself and to others this output is central to my value.
		- WORTHWHILE - Work should move society forward.  Be a net gain.  The more people affected, the greater the gain.
		- MY PRIME OUTPUT -- For me, my "prime output" in life are the ideas that I realize, in both a technical and social sense.
	
		- VISION -- some dan-specific ideas are being executed

	- ASPECTS:
		- INVENTING / BUILDING -- I spend my time 'inventing' things
		- SOCIAL SYSTEMS -- I am driven towards a kind of 'systems' thinking.
		- ORGANIZATIONAL / REPRESENTATIONAL -- I tend to think about org and rep
	 
	- SPRINT -- I am a sprinter, and am comefortable working intensly in a sprint, but I flag if doing admin/low-mental work for too many hours per month.

	- MONEY & FREEDOM -- Money buys freedom from the drudgery of work that does not stem from innate desire to create.  Money supports the family, and allows me to go where interest dictates rather than where money is plentiful.

	- FULFILLMENT - I am happiest when I am building/inventing.





	DETAILS
	- TECHNICAL -- At times in my life when my job became more "management" I am driven to create side projects which are technical building.
	- INVENT -- I am always 'inventing' things.  Thinking about the problems around me, and trying to see new ways to address them.  I stick with a few problems over many years, but I spend almost all of my time thinking thru solutions that I don't get feedback on, or try out in the world.
	- SOCIAL SYSTEMS -- Many of my ideas are "social systems" or self-working process in nature.
	- DETAILED DESIGN -- I am driven to think about the biggest of pictures, but then like to try to THINK THRU solutions down to pretty detailed levels.

	_
##### 2021.05.10 - LIFE VIEW

	Why Are we here?
	- **EXPERIENCES** -- _For the experiences we have_
		Measured by the subjective value we attach both at the time and after
	- **CONTRIBUTIONS** -- _For the contributions we make_
		Being part of, giving to, & receiving from others within a society we build
	- **GROWTH** -- _For the growth we undergo_
		To grow in faith, wisdom, and understanding

	What is Meaning/Purpose of life?
	- First, it is an adopted/constructed thing, but that fact should not and does not reduce its validity or importance.
	- For me, the "why are we here" goals are ends unto themselves

	Relation To Others
	- In the most important sense, we are peers of all others.
	- And building/living a relation with them is central to life.

	Good & Evil
	- Good is moving towards and living our purpose
	- Evil is moving away or destroying our purpose, or doing that to another

	Higher Power
	- I live my life beliving there is a higher power, though I will likely never know this with certainty.

	Role of joy, sorrow, justice, injustice, love, peace, and strife in life?
	- These are the backdrop of experiences, contributions, and growth.

Which Job Title Best Fit?


_
#### 2021.07.20 - ACTIVITY LOG
##### 2021.09.13 -- Writing up yet another idea (Alloy/crypto ownership)

Even as I am trying to really converge on which paths I will take, somehow I find myself thinking thru the details of yet another big idea.

This is really my M-O.  I am positively DRIVEN to think about:

-- yet another idea often focused on:
- Some big impact
- Solving some social-interactions problem
- A technically complex "clever" approach 
-- My M-O is to simply think hard and at a detailed level about how one would approach all the various aspects of the problem in question.



_
##### 2021.09.03 -- WORK: happy to chat fast; but then hand details off to others

- I enjoyed figure out how to address NIO and Dropwater
- But got ansy after even just 30 min of writing it up.  
	happier to hand off details


_
##### 2021.08.30 -- Inbox zero
- a goto activity for me is to read and process EASY emails
- want to switch away from any task when it gets harder except Uniform.
- like to execute easy quick tempo tasks for longer (emails, blogs, recipes)
- tend to want to swap tasks after 15min or so.  even doing this list was a bounce away from doing my three energy giving word maps.

_
##### 2021.08.30 -- Waste Time - Blog reading/responding - emails and tasks.
- These days I spend way too much time reading blogs.
- I spent hours giving my feedback to others that I read.
- I don't want huge followers, I am just compelled to engage once I have thought and have come to a conclusion about a subject.

_
##### 2021.08.26 -- Procrastinate
- When I get ready to work, I will procrastinate by doing many organizational tasks first:
	- read emails
	- read medium/blogs
	- organize todo lists, do quick items
	- do weekly tasks
	- 

_
##### 2021.08.26 -- Shelving / recipes
- I really like to organize things, spent hours designing and building shelving for ingredients, getting labels & containers.
- Spent many hours optomizing recipes so they would be time efficient to make.
- So time spent cooking is not valued by me, but time spent ORGANIZING to cook is compelling (even if not really so very fun)

_
##### 2021.06.00 -- QL modelling
- When QL came to me with several problems about how to model some aspect of self driving, I really found it fun to brainstorm how to attack the problem.
- I think for me the most fun part, is struggling to see the best way to attach the problem.  
- I also like helping others to attack the problem, then not having to screw around with the details involved in actually implementing it.

_
##### 2021.06.00 -- QL Hacking
I also then helped out by coding several parts of the data analytics process in python.  This was also fun.  I think doing it all day would get tedious, but if that were <=25% of my time it would be ideal.

_
##### 2021.07.25 -- Flighty Freddie
- While working on this activity log, I so badly want to jump to another activity.  (even a valuable one)  but the impulse is so fast that if I followed it, I would be jumping from one thing to the next is a very inefficient way.

_
##### 2016.00.00 -- Bizzy Robotics - Early days
I was naturally pulled into my work at Bizzy.  I was happy that in the evening I still was working on Uniform, but with Joe at the office, and with the CTO leadership role, I naturally fell into a pretty driven tempo.
- Worked on my "architecture" stuff too much.
- Didn't attend to impt aspects of leadership (lack of proclivity and skill)
- Gain value from being leader.
- GOOD: at relationship aspect of job.  good at vision and leadership.
- CORRECTABLE:  was too 'hot headed'.  
	- did not build regular handoff & check in processes

_
##### 2021.07.22 -- Foxglove robotics development platform
Got excited thinking about the idea of making a robotics-dev-studio that is efficient for doing robotics development work.  In general I think I am really motivated and excited to think about making efficient-to-use tools and processes.


_
##### 2021.07.21 -- Marcel response (flow)
When I saw marcel's note, I just could not help but to write my response.  Totally threw off my whole morning.  Immediately fought to load some needed open source (which I normally hate).  Each time I tried to work on something else, my brain kept going back to details about it.  really extremely hard for it to not just spontaneously break back into my thinking while on other topics.  Just gave up and wrote the reponse.

_
##### 2019.00.00 -- Block Chain
Operated in flow for months trying to build a new block chain.
- The ideas seemed very big.  I imagine large impact.
- Lots of creativity borne from just thinking hard for hours solving hard technical sub-problems.

_
##### 2021.07.20 -- Jump jump jump**
When I am working on a thing that I am drawn to, I will push to work more and more hours.  Easily dropping other things I want/need to do.  When it is an activity that I resist, then I find it overwhelming to want to switch away from this thing.  Right now I am trying to do my Job matrix, and I want to switch away.  It stresses me to think about it.  and I am not quite sure what I should put down on it.

_
##### 2021.07.19 -- Marcel response  -- couldn't stop writing it!**
I receieved his response email, and I immediately wanted to think thru my response.  Couldn't stop writing it up, until it was done.  Was willing to re-read and correct it -- even as I kinda hate doing that.

_
##### 2021.07.19 -- Thinking while walking
When walking my mind repeatedly returns to details of Uniform, and how I might frame and say part of it.  Or less so, how I might resolve this or that techical detail
_
#### 2021.07.28 - DECISION PATH

- GOOGLE et al is the back stop -- this what I do when all else fails
	- Specialties:  AI/ML, Management, Robotics/Vision, NLP
- INTERLUDE -- likely I have an interlude of 6mo to 2yr before.  what do I do?
	- PREP for GOOGLE

_
#### 2020.10.02 - An assessment of me


Quick Observations:
- IDEAS -- I focus on the technical: the big idea, and technical details
- COMMITMENT -- I systematically dodge certain commitment steps
- CAT -- I jump from idea to idea
- VARIABLE -- impt stuff per day, can vary from near zero to good
- BURSTY -- I can execute well as a burst, but not continuous
	(except SW or idea coding)
- LIMIT -- seem to have daily limit (3h), not effective after
- WORKY -- I am always "working" its my mental mode
- SWEET SPOT


SWEET SPOT -- I dive to this place often
- technical idea 
- "of the mind" -- just pencil and paper, no research, etc.
- MINE -- I feel the idea is one other's don't see
- SYSTEMATIC -- idea is a systems idea relating to how things work
- BULLET -- idea is single "silver bullet" for some acknowledged problem

AVERSION
- HOP -- Love pushing deep into an idea, but after certain 
- Research
- Execution
- Commitment
- PRAGMATIC SHORT TERM
- RISK AVERSE at commitment stage


PRETENDING -- pretending I might do a thing, but knowing in heart I wont
With JASON flirted, but was never going to say yes, but spent time pretending

### 2021.04.11 - NFT transfer
#### _
Atilla,
Please treat this idea with care... since it could have value. 
Not sure why I kept thinking about this, but I think I have an approach where NFTs from multiple chains could be merged into a new NFT univers on some different chain:

BIG BACKGROUND IDEA: COLLECTIVE QUALITY -- First here is a big idea (I think).  Once you start having multiple NFT universes, and multiple NFT granting sources, there will be some pressure to not allow just any old NFT into your universe.  The value of the universe will be tied to the average and median value of the NFTs in that universe.  This will be true at both the specific minting market place (vendor) level, and will also be true across the whole market place.  Once there are multiple universes and marketplaces within them, there will be a premium on those universes that have some quality control over the market.  (So this is really a separate thread of thought about how you grade and ensure high quality within your market.  For example, if Barack Obama creates an NFT of his 2008 inaguration speech, that will have much greater value than if *I* create one of his speech.  Self-working mechinsms for ensuring this will have great value...  let me put that aside as a different startup!)  For now, just notice that it is important to the community itself that it control what NFTs get created within the universe.  Trash will pollute!


The basic idea underlying this is that the holder of the original NFT burns that NFT in a way that can be uniquely linked to a new transfer NFT.  I think this mechanism retains the identity guarantees across chains!

~~~~~~
Here is my "transfer of NFT" approach:

CREATION -- First the new NFT universe born, and a community of users form using NFTs created in this universe. 

BETTER -- This NFT universe is cheaper with more features than other NFT universes. (if it were not, why would other WANT to come) 

IMPORT CONTROL -- In order for this NFT universe to maintain is quality control while taking over the NFTs from other universes, it is critical that no one can *fake* the import of an NFT from another universe, but then double spend or such.  (Ensuring valid importation is just one part of that larger idea of collective quality, but it is also required in order for others to trust the transfer of NFTs into this universe.)

IMPORT CONTROL BOARD -- In order for importation to occur from a particular chain, a quorum of control board members (who are big HOLDRs) from the community is formed.  
- Each member must be in a position to execute code on a physical machine that they strongly trust.
- They must stake a large fraction of their coin into an importation contract.
- They publish a staking contract which is there indication that they wish to be part of the board being formed.
- They download the importation computation software onto their trusted machines and the execute it.
- The results of the computation are published on chain in special NFT transfer recepts.
- After a fixed (fairly short) period of time their staked funds are released back to them, along with a reward for participating as a board member.
- An import control board can be convened at any moment in time, but the fees generated are proportional to the number of NFTs that were transferred, so board members may want to wait until enough built up.

CATCHER NFT -- An owner of an NFT in some other chain must mint a "catcher" NFT within the new chain if they want to initiate a transfer.  
- The catcher NFT lists the MAX transfer fee the holder is willing to pay in order to get their NFT transferred.
- This NFT will publish a unique public key in the catcher NFT, but it has no other contents.

BURNING THE NFT -- Then in order to transfer an NFT into this marketplace, the owner of the NFT in the old chain must "burn" the NFT in a verifiable way, and then must associate the burnt NFT with the unique public key in the catcher NFT they created in the new chain.

BOARD FORMATION -- A formation contract can be published at anytime, by any one.  
- It specifies a number of board members, a formation time period, an exeuction period, a holding period, a staking amount per member, an NFT unlock fee amount, and an upfront good faith board formation coin amount in the formation contract.
- The formation contract also specifies all of the import chains and the relevant block height ranges that are to be imported.  So the working zone of the board is precisely defined.
- Socially the community has agree to just ignore any formations that don't have sufficient good faith capital, or per member stake money.  (and maybe there are global minimums)
- Socially these things are generally only created after a group of relevant folks have informally decided it is a good time to run an importation board.
- The community members to creating a staking transaction become the board members, if too many stake, then are random set is derived by hashing all according to a seed derived from the whole set.
- This gives us a random set of HOLDRs that have all stakes alot of coin to be a member.

IMPORT CONTROL EXECUTION -- When the import control algoirthm runs on each board member's machine:
- It scans the defined set of other chains for these burnt NFTs
- Each time it finds one it tries to match it to some catcher NFT in the new chain.
- If if finds a match then it checks that the catching NFTs max fee is greater equal to this boards transfer fee amount.  If this board is asked for higher fees, then the NFT is ignored.
- Otherwise this NFT is added to the growing transfer summary being calculated.  This board member is asserting that the new NFT is the sole match for this older NFT.
- In the case that meta data or other info existed in the old NFT is must also exist in the same form in the catcher NFT, and the board member verifies that this information matches as well.
- Each board member publishes one (or could be multiple tranactions which represent their findings along with a verification hash)
- The board creation agent publishes a summary transaction containing the signed checksums from all board members (or maybe it only needs to be close to unanimous?), and it also publishes the full receipt of all transferred NFT ids.

COMMUNITY VERIFICATION -- 
- INCENTIVE -- According to dans "big idea" all holders of NFTs within this universe have a vested interest in not allowing low quality NFTs into their space.  In particular if forgery transfers are at all possible, then no one would trust transfers into this space, since one could not be sure that later someone would transfer a forgery in, and dilute/destroy the value of yours.
- QUICK CHECK -- Thus at a minium the community can verify that the checksums match, if they don't anybody can run the code and see who is lying.
- BURNING A BOARD MEMBER -- In the case that the community determines that a board member acted in bad faith, any NFT holders who have registered to vote (via special transaction) within the last year (or whatever) can vote to burn this member.
- SUBJECTIVE -- Notice, this is really a subjective decision the board member has staked alot of capital and if they ran the code in good faith, then it would be wrong to nail them.  I think it will be clear if something was part of a concerted plot.  (and it would require collusion of a HUGE number of board members, and the entire NFT community to be aleep at the wheel)  Thus one really does not need to burn a board member unless you are pretty darn sure they were up to no good.
- BURNING -- If a board member is burned...  there stake is literally burnt -- it is not transferred to ANYONE.  I think this will never happen, but I worry if it is transferred to anyone, there will be some incentive to use this vote mechanism to steal money from honest members.
- 4 OUT OF 5 VOTE -- In the case that a board member really tries to cheat it will be so obvious to all, one can compute what they should have generated.  So if there is any question that they didn't mean it, we can not burn them, and the whole system is not really at risk. 
- LARGE STAKE -- I think what really ensures honest execution is having large HOLDR stakes at risk during these times...  no one is going to be lax about their computer's security at this time!  (but getting large stake requries that HOLDRs feel confident that even if something were to go wrong, the community would not harm them if they intended no harm.)


UNLOCK -- A transfer NFT contract is unlocked once a board with sufficient staking funds has concluded that the transfer is complete.  This can be computed directly from that summary transaction.  Notice the genesis transfer NFT lets you know how much money was at stake when it was minted, and how many board members etc.  So there is a measure of its strength.  Still I think the whole NFT community will want to require certain miniumums for certain transfers.  (perhaps this will vary by the general values found on different chains.)

PAYMENT -- Each NFT transfer has a unique index starting at zero within the summary transaction. Part of the execution of the unlock for a transfer NFT is the payment of ONE of the board members, their board participation fee.  If 'N' is the number of board members, then the NFT index mod N indicates which single board member this NFT unlocking should pay its unlocking fee to.  So if a board is convened with fees that are too small, it might be hard to find willing board members.  But it one waits along time so there are many NFTs to be transferred, then the price can go down.  


So that is the system.  NOTICE:
- What is cool is it does not place much of any constraint connecting the two chains.  Not even a shared hashing function is required.  
- One just needs a verifiable way to burn an NFT in the source chain, and
- needs an unambiguous way to associate the burnt NFT to a transfer NFT, but this could just be the TXID or ACCOUNT id for the NFT... really every NFT needs a unique handle of some kind.
- Notice this could really be used over and over to transfer NFTs in an ongoing way.
- It could even be a continuous transfer mechanism, but I think one would need to work out a way to pay on a rolling basis.
- Notice the board member fees are paid out according to what the formation contract states, so if a board is convened with a low transfer fee, HOLDRs might decide it is not worth their effort.
- Still on rare occasion one might form a board with a very low transfer fee.  this would catch those stingy transfers that were willing to wait for this rare event (which would eventaully have large value since it would be scooping up many NFT transfers that have been created over a large range of time.)
- Notice there is no danger of overlapping board formations causing duplication troubles.  One can only burn the source NFT once!  And the owner of the private key that signed the burning transaction is the only one that can create a valid transfer NFT matching it.
- As an advanced trick we could allow duplicate transfer NFTs, this would allow one to change details about the transfer (like fees) after doing the burn.
- NOTICE:  Being a board member would require one to verify that NEVER in the history of the NFT universe has this NFT been transferred by any prior board.  I can think of some adaptations that could make that not require unbounded memory as time move forward...   I think the trick is each transfer frame should only have an ending height not a starting height.  that way you could just keep track of the last board summaries and what heights they already covered.



ok... it was kinda rediculous to write this up.
but fun.  (I have not re-read it, so I am not sure how clear it is)

talk more soon!

	Jason,
	Quite a ride.  Being co-founders is quite a sweet picture for me, so I just decided to take this very seriously and do the early analysis as if this were already my business.



	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

	1.  I agree we you and I are slicing the rec market differently, and my slicing gives a 4% penentration.  Below I argue why I think you should split your analysis into direct to team vs direct to gym, and I think we both agree direct to gym is 4%.

	2.  I am NOT bullish on the "Smart-phone-app direct to team" market.  Non-stickiness, thin margins, cost of cust acquisitions, app-pricing expectations all kill this path (see my analysis in #2 below)

	3.  I am bullish on the value of developing the underlying AI-based sports tracking technology, though it does carry a notable risk of being eclipsed before one can sell it.

	I split the AAU market into "up market" (4) and "down market" (5)

	4. I am NOT bullish on UP market AAU leagues/tournaments.
		This is not fully explored so this could change, but synergy and hudl are both in this market.  They have so much money one cannot win on price.  Manual works fine.
	
	5. I am less clear about the down market AAU teams.  These will be very rec oriented, or younger.  Either way they wont care about stats, BUT maybe some vanity/show-daddy-my-game works.

	6. The "Show-Daddy / Instagram-posting" market
		Many I spoke with see the value of a solution that intelligently highlights a single player within the game.  
		- This is a big market since the down market is large.
			It applies to #5 but others as well.
		- Still it has all the problems of #2 above (which can kill it)
		- I believe there is significant room for UX innovation here in order to make this product distinct and valuable.
		- But UX innovation can and will be copied.
		- In the end I am a bit negative on this market, but perhaps it is still possible to eek out a thin-margin, big-business with small-mote. 
	
	7. All the other markets.  You gestured towards international markets and all these other sport markets, and added up all the numbers and said wow this is a big TAM.  I am overall not very bullish on using a single TAM for this and treating it as a single addressable market.  But still I do see some hopes in this space see analysis below.

	8. I am most bullish on the direct to gym market.  For me this is the clearest gem in the whole space.  
		- The market is largely green field (no existing products)
		- Customers are hungry for a differentiation for their gym
			(and nearly all see tech as a sexy answer)
		- Solution needs custom HW (maybe we can build from existing)
		- Needs a second direct relation to teams/players
			(gyms were ok w. this as long we gave players something for free)
		- Most excitingly it seems plausible we might get a network effect with even a few as 5-10% of players have Visio accounts, and thus prefering Visio-enabled gyms.
			(could you own gyms as HUDL owns High School?)


	ROLLUP 

	For Dan I the gym market gem and value of selling the underlying tech are not large enough to generate the kind of exit required in order to make his resulting 15% stake worth giving up Analytics Fire and dedicating the next many years exclusively to Sports Visio.  So unless new info comes to light I am going to wind down my focus on Visio… 

	But notice my analysis for Jason is quite different.  I AM bullish on this picture if I were sitting where you are.  Your upfront risks are significantly reduced by your use of equity-driven early labor (smart move!).  Visio does require an upfront focus from you, but then as the work of developing a solution gets into full swing this can easily become a "one-of-many" activity for you.  Given its low financial costs to you, you could really do SEVERAL such startups in parallel if you can generate a few more good ideas!  Then you can spread risks over multiple paths.


	--Dan





	DETAILED ANALSIS FOR EACH SECTION ABOVE


	=== ANALYSIS FOR #1 - THE PROPER WAY TO SLICE THE MARKETS ===

	JASON WROTE:
	You're still slicing it wrong I think. You're taking 20% of gyms, and THEN only taking 20% of THOSE teams. That's 4% market penetration, not 20! That's a little crazy for a market with almost nothing available today. It's why your numbers are so anemic. I plan to sign up entire gyms like MBA at once (100%), and in cases when they DON'T do that, THEN go directly to the teams (or some hybrid model.) 


	I agree that my analysis amounts to a 4% player market penetration, however, I think this is an accurate analysis of the gym-to-team-captain path that I favor.

	In any case the:
		a. gym-driven-market, 
		b. league-driven-market, and 
		c. team-driven-market 
	are all very different markets, and the way one would try to attack each of them is very different.  Which results in a very distinct penetration and business model for each.  So even in this earliest stage I think one must consider and model these specifically and individually if one is to have any kind of accuracy in the result.

	NOTICE:
	If our goal is to show a huge TAM for our investors... sure just lump it all together and hope they don't notice.  
	But when we want to make the best model we can in order to drive best business choices we should not use that kind of analysis.




	=== ANALYSIS FOR #2 - THE "SMART-PHONE DIRECT-TO-TEAM" MARKET ===

	I agree one can market directly to rec teams to get them to sign up from some website or the app store, but I think this pathway is quite fraught for a number of reasons:

	— This is 100,000 teams you are trying to market to.  
	— This means you will be unable to have any kind of relationship-driven marketing at that scale.  You must rely on websites, and generic advertising.  BUT
	    — These team captains are not part of any kind of trade-show circuit or professional orgs.  They just love and play basketball.
	    — Thus you will have to advertise in very generalize channels in order to get to them.  This will be expensive.
	    — I think the cost of reaching team captains can easily approach or overwhelm the lifetime value of those relationships.
	— Also the team captains are not the ones gaining the majority of the value from having this service.  Rather it is the players on the team that are willing to pay the extra $30 to get the video clips etc. The are the ones gaining the big value in rec leagues.
	   (NOTE: I chose $30 per player since it represents a 10% increase in costs for adult leagues... I expect children leagues have much lower fees, but parents make be willing to pay a larger percentage increases too.)
	— But the team captain is the one who will have to manage the complexity of recording the games, etc.   I dont think he will want to, not for the bulk of the down-market informal teams.

	— The price expectation for an iPhone app is at a very different price point.  We can see the assistance apps that exist for basketball and other sports as examples.  I don't see such apps with large cash outlays per year per team.
	    Having a fixed camera in a gym puts us in a very different market.

	— There is no stickiness to an iPhone app 
	  (but a great stickiness for a physical device in a gym)
	— I am confident (as are you) that we will have competitors in auto game analysis (autostats is one that is already there)
	    Thus any iPhone app will be locked into a "race to the bottom" style of competition, even if not in the beginning, in the end any profit margin will erode away.  


	So for all of these reasons, the go-directly-to-the-rec-team-captain route looks like a non-starter to me.

	I do believe in the reg-league market, but I believe in the more narrow gym-install market as I have outlined above.




	=== ANALYSIS FOR #3 - Selling the underlying AI-tech ===

	I am bullish on the underlying tech.  I think it can be done (indeed it IS being done) and there are companies like Stats Perform that are already doing it (see below), and orgs like NCAA messing around with algorithms to do it too.

	Getting to SELL this technology is going to be a bit tricker.
	I think this can still work, but it requires building a specialized solution for the particular market segment you are aiming at, then selling that technology to a bigger player that wants that market.  (e.g. a gym install really requires its own signup flow, etc. all that is distinct to that situation.  good for us!)

	The Auto Stats algorithm from Stats Perform is probably good enough right now to address the gym market.  But the UX for their solution is all wrong for that market, and that is not their focus.  Thus moving quick and producing a ready made solution for the gym market could yield a mid seven figure "build verses buy" kind of opportunity for someone who wants that market.  (If Visio has ALSO already taken parts of that market, then this figure would go up.  See Analysis #8)

	So this is a nice little nugget.  but it really does carry time risk, since multiple players would just need to build the right UX, AND there will only be one or two buyers in this market... it is not big enough for multiple big corps to be duking it out over the gym market.


	PAPER SHOWING BBALL TRACKING
	https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f1af76ed86d6771ad48324b/5f6a64711514cb41b91b37d5_Johnson_extracting_player_tracking_data-compressed.pdf

	Not sure if you saw this paper, but we should try to connect with this Neil Johnson fellow.  He basically attacked the full BBall tracking problem with several smart algorithmic hacks.  He achieved 92% accuracy (but without enough data to have confidence in that number.)

	NOTE: His paper really shows us the challenge of getting good labelled data.  And it also shows that one smart guy can spend less than a year to make very real progress on this problem.  So we cannot treat this as a super strong technical mote.

	STATS PERFORM AI-BASED TRACKING
	https://www.statsperform.com/team-performance/basketball/advanced-player-data/

	These guys are not presently attacking the markets of interest to Visio.  but when considering the selling of the underlying AI-tech (which is the topic of Analysis #6)




	=== ANALYSIS FOR #4 and #5 - THE AAU MARKET ===

	I am not very bullish for either the up market or down market AAU opportunties.  This is an area that merits further investigation, I am not fully confident in my opinions here.  Still this is what I found:

	UP MARKET
	- I am not bullish on the up market AAU opportunity.  As one person commented, ``they have infinite money so you cannot compete on price.''  I think this is right.  This leaves us competing on features.
	- But we already know that Synergy is in that market, and HUDL is messing with it.  
	- Because I think network effect across the AAU leages will be strong, AND I see that we have two established players already serving this market, I think the chances that there is an angle in on this market is not high.
	- What features are we going to be offering this market that they current players cannot offer at any price?
			Realtime stats seems to be the only answer.
	

	DOWN MARKET
	- League fees for children leagues seems to be notably lower than the fees adults pay at rec gyms.  This is something that I only have indirect evidence for, but I have multiple data points making that same claim, and it also makes sense to me logically.
	- Also it seems pretty clear that the down market teams are not going to care at all about stats, so at the team level there is little pressure to adopt a Visio, it provides little benefit for them at the team level (it's all about show-daddy).
	- Because of opportunity #6 (show daddy/instagram) there could be a play where the children's parents for an AAU team coordinate the usage of some Visio solution, and then collectively pay for it.
		- This will be a marketing hat trick to pull off that kind of market adoption model, but maybe it can be done?

	So if there is an opportunity in this space, it is down market and connected with #6 below.In the end, I only spoke to three AAU leagues and none were positive hits for this idea, and found a Synergy user who could show me their penetration into the AAU markets.  ugh.


	Still for both up market and down market, I did not do enough analysis for me to feel confidence in my negative outlook.  So I will just end with a magic 8-ball answer:
		Don't count on it

	Or at least, if I were you I would assume it will NOT work, until you have found compelling evidence for some sub-part of that market that is telling you a very different story!




	=== ANALYSIS FOR #6 - THE INSTAGRAM AND SHOW DADDY OPPORTUNITY ===

	I like this use case.  It applies to multiple different customer segments above.  Further, multiple people I spoke with saw an opportunity for some kind of intelligent per-player video-focused summary service.

	More serious players are already paying very real money to gather videos and cut "player reels".  As much as $300 per GAME! in order to have a person attend the game and record their play!

	Less serious players nonetheless love the game, and love that their kids are playing the game.

	This second case in particular, feels ripe for innovation to me.
	I think there is an opportunity to generate some polished "montague" style outputs, that are designed to put into an electronic picture frame, or on social media.  So in addition to the technical innovation of player tracking, the UX innovation of getting those polished outputs into ideal form, and connected in all the right ways to all of the right media channels will be have notable customer value.

	Moreover this is potentially a very large market, since the down market parts are much larger than the up market parts in all of the markets we are considering.

	This biggest negative I see for this area is the dearth of ANY kind of a mote.  It will actually be quite HARD for you to iterate and innovate to get this UX right.  But then it will be super EASY for any competitor to just copy what you did, once you figure it out.  No mote.

	Any mote will come from some kind of lock on some marketplace.  Sadly it will not come from UX innovation... it will come from some other place.

	Thus as a business model for Visio, I don't love this path.  But I do like it as an ADD ON feature for some other market penetration model with its own market stickiness mechanism.  In that case I do see these features as a significant value multiplier.

	(But we know that multiplying anything by ZERO still gives you ZERO.  So this feature cannot be the backbone of any strategy.)




	=== ANALYSIS FOR #7 - ALL THE OTHER MARKETS ===

	JASON WROTE
	And by the way we want to add other sports in, like soccer which is 7x more popular than hoops globally! I got an interesting data point that UCLA is paying $1400/month to a kid who just sits there and types in stats for volleyball games and they'd LOVE to have an app that does that for them. I can't imagine volleyball stats would be more difficult than hoops, seems way easier given the smaller size and lack of horizontal movement between players (I guess ball tracking might be a minor issue?) Market has to be WAY smaller (IMO) but if there isn't an option at the D1 college level like UCLA is, then there is a chance to enter higher up in the market and maybe make our investment back quickly. 54 men's teams, 330 women's... at over 4 months long and $500/month, that's $2k a team... assume something optimistic like 50% penetration/200 teams (some other D3 or whatever) and you'd have $400k a year. Not exciting. There are 500,000 players in HS though. There are 11 on a typical varsity team, so that's about 50,000 HS teams. At $250/team/season (pretty conservative, they play like 25 matches so that's only $10/match for 60-90 minutes, that's $2.5M if 20% use it. Gets more interesting. Add in some pro leagues and you could probably get to $3M+ a year in the US, maybe $9-10M globally if the same ratio applies as hoops. Not as exciting by a long shot IMHO, but interesting exercise for a niche sport I suppose. 


	~~~~

	Yeah, there are alot of other sports out there.  If you go for the gym market, two different gyms mentioned flag football as their runner up sport they would love to have covered, and volleyball was mentioned as well. 

	Still I am NOT bullish on computing a TAM for these others and treating them as part of the market to be addressed.  Indeed I don't think this market will be organized by by sports at all.  Instead, just as with HUDL and Synergy models, these solutions will break down by customer type, and then provide a single multi-sport solution to those addressed customers.

	So in calculating the additional value one obtains from these additional sports one needs to compute the incremental value one obtains from ones EXISTING market segments, but then selling new sport solutions to them.

	This will be a much smaller number, but I think this is how these markets are working.  Getting penetration into gyms for basketball, for example, will provide real lift in getting volleyball sales into those same gyms, but it will provide nearly no benefit in attacking HUDL's lock on volleyball in highschool, or Synergy's lock on certain collegiate teams.

	I agree there likely are other greenfield opportunities in non-basketball markets, but one cannot just compute a TAM over the whole space and have a meaningful number.  These greenfield gems will be few and far between.

	And I expect that those other greenfield opportunities will be also down market in the cracks not covered by the customer-centric horizontal plays that dominate the upper markets.

	Further, even in these down market areas I expect they will get eventually get filled by customer-centric multi-sport plays just as HUDL is doing to highschools... it is up to you go find and grow your own horizonal play within some yet unknown down market greenfield starting spot.




	=== ANALYSIS FOR #8 - THE GYM MARKETS ===

	I like the gym market.
	- It is greenfield in the sense that few gyms have a solution today in their gym.
	- Its customers WANT the product today.  Especially on the heels of Covid, multiple gyms I spoke with are all looking for ways to differentiate themselves from other gyms, and each one that I spoke with liked using a technology-based differentiation.
	- It is very sticky since you are installing actual hardware in their gym.  It will be hard for others to displace you once you are in that gym.
	- It might have a network effect.  If you penetrate a couple of gyms within an area, then you are in a great position to establish a relationship directly with players in those gyms. This will in turn put pressure on other gyms to also have the same technology, otherwise they will loose all players that have a Visio account.

	**RUN AWAY NETWORK EFFECT**
	- In my most optomistic scenerio, Visio could actually tip the whole gym market within a geography
	- In the case that most of the costs for the Visio HW are offloaded onto the players served by a gym, you might get the costs for installing HW in a gym down to near zero, for the owner.
	- At the same time, as players within a geography tend to bounce around between gyms, and will put pressure on non-install gyms to install the system.
	- If the market is still greenfield in that moment, AND Visio costs are near zero for the gym, you could have a wild-fire mass adoption within the geographies with player adoption.
	- Perhaps even a small penetration (5-10%) in the player community might be enough to drive mass adoption for the gyms within the geography!!

	THIS IS AN EXCITING IDEA!

	I dont know what the chances are for this to happen, but each of the individal parts seems very plausible... it is just a case of counting chickens well before they are hatched.  

	One should not count on such a massive win in this early stage.  But still it is plausible, and if that kind of wild fire adoption did happen, it would boost my earlier email analysis by a factor of 3 or 4.  The wild fire effect would not drive up the adoption per player, just the adoption per gym.  There will still be those players that care and those that don't.  But it could drive the 20% gym adoption to 70% gym adoption, and it would lead to a nicely LOCKED UP MARKET too as well.

	_
##### xxx
	OLDER STUFF

	It would move the gym market from a $1-2M annually to $3-6M annually.

		I am NOT bullish on a tech-forward attach on these other markets.  I do think the tech is relevant to those markets, but just as with the highschool market, it will turn out that the way existing tech is laid out will dominate the discussion of the markets viability.  
		I am bullish on using the MARKET penetration that one achieve with Visio to take on other sports.  So for example if one sells gyms on cameras for basketball THEN one can upsell volleyball and flag football.
	~~
	Still in the end I think these sports are going to be covered by HUDL or others if at the High School or Collegiate levels.  So I think you are still looking at scooping these other sports out of the gym market.   This will definitely help, since you just need a few more cameras and you have covered the whole gym, but I bet this is not more than a factor of 2x boost since I think a lot of the energy is going to come from basketball.
	~~
	All the other markets.  You gestured towards international markets and all these other sport markets, and added up all the numbers and said wow this is big.   
	~~
	You asked me what I thought the next steps were.  Well I do want to do a more digging on the AAU market, but so far I am not seeing even a mid eight figure exit as possible, forget a nine figure exit.  But still I think this remains an interesting proposition for Jason Syversen.  You have got a number of guys coming in at 1/2 salary, and the rest at low salary.  Then I bet you will succeed in your seed investing (I am not so sure about the VC investing).  But that is enough.  You can just start installing into gyms and making money.  It will take some years of effort but it will be 50x ROI for you money in.  Not too shabby!  Especially since I think you can do this as one of multiple things you are doing.  

	For me the equations may not be as rosy.  I need to give up analytics fire and other activities, but at a $20M exit I net a $3M after some years explaining to the wife why I am not earning anything yet.

#### 2021.04.01 - Jason #5

	Jason,

	My plan is to wind down my investigation soon.  Since I saw options outside the highschool market I decided not let my negative results there, stop me from digging further...  

	And just as you found in your discussions, when I got into the league and gym owner market, I started getting much more positive signals.  Without exception gym owners are bullish in principle on the idea.  They are in a competitive race to get players and teams to want to come to their gym.  Especially on the heels of Corona each one of them is focused on what they need to do to out compete other gyms in getting the players/team to choose them.

	It is going to be tough to roll out fast enough, but this will be an awesome wave to ride if Visio can make it in time.  Gym owners talked about wanting to bundle this offering (for free) to their members, then one could try to upsell individual

#### 2021.03.27 - Jason analysis #4

	Jason, 
	The analysis continues!  Getting people on the phone is quite a SLOG, but I have had some luck.  Including two managers of a local YMCA.  Both were generally positive on the idea, one even said he wanted to find a solution by this fall! (Details at bottom)

	Because the league market is services BY the gyms, it occurs to me that one way to understand both of these markets is to do an estimation based on these gyms.  Here are some slices thru the data.  I would like to get your (and Sam's opinion on these calculations):


	$300	Annual cost per player.  ($3000team/year / 10plr/team)
	$30		Visio revenue per player per year.  (10% total spent)

	2,000	For Profit Gyms in USA. (8 * 328M / 1.36M = 1929)
	20% 	penetration into market
	400		Visio Gym installs

	15		teams/gym
	10		players/team
	150		Addressable Players within one gym
	20%		penetration into players at gyms
	30		paying players at one gym
	$900	Visio revenue per gym.  ($30 * 30)

	360K	Visio annual revenue from players @ for profit gyms
	~1M		Visio revenue including intl market  (using your x3)


	Of course there will be other markets than just the for profit gym market, but the thing about this market, is I think we could land it and keep it.  Other markets have less $$$ per player, and the iPhone app market I think is not sticky, is lower price expectation, and will get overrun with competitors in the long run generating a race to the bottom.

	The one other big market this does not cover is the AAU market, particularly selling to tournament directors seems very interesting since it would be sticky in their gyms, and they have CASH!

	--dan




	$150	Assumed revenue per team per season
	$50		Assumed revenue per player (I made this up)
	2,700	YMCA in USA
	8		For Profit Gyms in New Hamshire
	2,000	For Profit Gyms in USA. (8 * 328M / 1.36M = 1929)
	5,000	Total Gyms in the USA

	1,000	Total Gym Installs (assuming 20% penetration)


	2		Seasons per year
	20		Teams per gym per season
	10		Players per team
	400 	Total rec league players per gym per year (2 * 20 * 10)
	8		Teams serviced, assuming 20% penetration (2 * 20 * .20)
	40		Players services, assuming 10% penetration

	$1,200	Fees per gym (assuming $150 for 20% of teams)
	$2,000	Fees per gym (assuming $50 for 10% of the people)


	~ $2M	Annual revenue from the Gym market.

	Notice, I am getting something like $2K per gym per year.
	(Not $10K or $20K.  I need a crazy 20% penetration and a $100 per player I get = 400 * .3 = 120 * 100 = $8K per gym

	~ $8M	Annual revenue with crazy optomistic per person pentration rate (I think it is not reasonable, but I just tried it out.). And I also double the per person rate to equal our original per team rate.  This also seems unlikely, but I am not a clear about that.  If we add lots of vanity video and such, then while it wont increase the penetration rate, it does seem for those that care, it can increase the rate they will pay.)


	~~~~~
	CALL DETAILS

	Based on my early calls to gyms I *DO* see the same gap in the market gym market.  Their response to the technology is quite different than at the highschool level.  (Hooray!)  They just do not have any technology like this, and HUDL is way too expensive.

	I was not able to get interest from any leagues, but mostly I am just not getting them to talk to me.  (A few did, and they were not in a position to pay for such a thing, but I still just don't understand that market.)

	One manager of a YMCA was *very* bullish on this technology.  Indeed he told me that they were looking for a solution like this to be purchased by the fall time!!  That was shocking to me, how could this be, when this technology doe not exist yet?!?  But when I pushed further it turns out that their goal for the year is to introduce more technology into the gym as a way to differentiate the gym.  (The have had good luck with other kinds of analytic technolgies, for heart, and ideal respiration, etc.)  So he was not looking SPECIFICALLY for this technology, but once he understood it, he wanted it!  He like the stats, and he liked the idea of a system that provides a montague of a players best shots or such even better.  And best of all his inclination was to bundle the cost of this service into his gym fee, instead of charging each team.  He said it would probably increase his membership fee a "couple of bucks", but then eat the rest of his costs himself.  I said so charge each team something like $10 more?  He said yes, but he was fine supplementing this since he sees this as a way to draw more customers.  Still we are talking $10/team!  And I am the one that said this number, he said a couple of bucks, so I think he was thinking less.  So I cannot imagine he is aiming for anything beyond a couple of thousand AT MOST. For covering his gym.

	Also it seems to me that getting this service installed INTO the gym is pretty key.  that way no one needs to do anything, and the game is recorded by default.  I think this will be huge in converting new customers.  I suspect this is the main way to go.  But notice it does mean that we are either developing our own HW.. or there is a solution that we can access that is not part of a competitor's bundle (like HUDL focus).

	~~~~

	In the end I am doubtful that leagues will pay very much per team in order for the whole league to have this service.  I am not sure, but it seems this would happen in the case that a league is competing on tech features against another league for some coveted players.. but is this really the circumstance?

	I *DO* think that gyms want to compete on features, but as I look at the numbers it seems hard to see how a gym would make money by paying $20K extra for this service.  $2K or maybe even $5K makes sense, Still I don't have hard data yet to back that belief up.

	I am not at all clear that one can parlay ones wins in the gym market into other market.  I do see evidence that once one in a single gym, they will want us to provide stats for other sports.  (several have mentioned flag football)  but I am not clear that this will translate into much larger figure per gym.


	~~~~

	So this is an update from the last time we talked.  For the first time I am hitting folks that clearly see the value of this service, and do not already have access to the service.  COOL!

	But so far I am not seeing anything like $20K per gym, nor am I seeing the abilty to jump from the gym/league channel to another channel.

	(I am kind of bundling these two channels together, since anyone who plays in a league often is at one of these gyms, and anyone who plays regularly on a team at one of these gyms is in a league.  Correct me if I am wrong about that.)

	Thus it seems there **IS** a chance to own a market (the gyms) as well as the underlying tech.  so this puts us in the solid eight-figure range, but still the low eight-figures.


	Thoughts?

	MY THINKING

#### 2021.03.20 - Jason response #3


	Your research is making me to want try to exhaustively describe the market in NH. I'm going to try to find EVERY AAU team/program, gym with leagues, and nail down the number of private High schools. All of those are sweet pickings for us, I agree the public HS market will be tougher. I also suspect we can pick up JV programs and/or middle school teams too as I doubt many of them use HUDL. I've got some marketing intern candidates lined up, was hoping to do that. 

	Anyway, also found an interesting note... Pixelot is a sports camera manufacturer that I think is seeing the vertical integration happening from HUDL and getting nervous. They bought Vidswap, an "AI" video production/analysis platform to facilitate sharing game analysis and such and I think fend off the HUDL monopoly. Note they have a large amount of customers too, so all those times you're panicking that HUDL owns the entire market this should be slightly reassuring. (Since they don't do automated stats) https://www.pixellot.tv/press-releases/pixellot-announces-acquisition-of-game-analysis-platform-vidswap/

	Jason

	~~~~~~~


	Jason, 

	When you have a moment, I would love to get on the phone to talk about all of this analysis I have been doing lately.  I have never gone this deep on diligence for a company that I didn't yet work for!  I've been going to the mat for this because I really do value co-founding with someone I trust and someone that I believe in.

	Yeah, a couple of of the high schools use and love pixelot... I think the vid-swap company is all about making professional looking video feeds w/o human support.  I asked one coach why have BOTH a HUDL Focus AND a Pixelot.  His answer was ``Because vidslot has a relationship with the NFHS network so you can broadcast your games on cable’’  So I actually think vidslot play is also a network play (but in this case it is an actual TV network :-)  I do think the video feed market pretty fragmented and open.  On the east coast at least there multiple other companies that specialize is video game feeds.  Scarsdale TV auto feeds to cable and to vimeo channels too.  Local Live will record games for cable, but then also auto feed them into HUDL too.  But you are right, there is more openness in that part of the market.

	I have spoken with a couple of vision tech companies as well.  Just as you found, it does seem like this is an area where the tech is up to the task.  I think one can likely build tech that gets up into the high 90s in accuracy, and in that case I think multiple players in the market will be interested in buying the tech from Visio.  I think the tech by itself is an eight-figure exit.  I think you and I agree that companies are not going to pay more than $10M for tech that really exists in many places even if not applied yet to sports.  They can build it or buy it for less.  The real key is building the tech and having significant market share too.

	If we managed to find a nitch that can be dominated with this tech, then it is possible this could be some kind of nine-figure-exit since we are owning both the tech and a market.  But I am become dubious about the viability of this option.  First I am not sure there IS a nine-figure market available to be taken.  Sadly, I think we are now competing on price and not on features; anything an AI can do, a human can do too (Indeed this is what the competition is already doing).  And on price alone I don't think you can gain market share in the HS, College, or Pro markets.  As you see with my early looking at the AAU market below, it really did not feel great at all.  Perhaps I am over-relying on just a couple conversations regarding the gym market, but those conversations really put a web blanket on the idea that rec team players would pay for stats.  Perhaps a low nine-figure exit could be possible based on providing gyms with other services not as focused on stats.

	The other consideration is that the further we get away from AI-based stats, the more it matters that we out innovate others on our business model, our UX, our partnerships, etc.  But I think this is getting further from our core competency.

	Finally a ten-figure exit is completely out of range in my opinion.  In order to hit this, we need to make significant inroads into multiple sports within a moderately big market like high school sports or such.  I just don't see the opportunity to do that.  The network effects of the existing players are too strong.  Breaking that requires that we can do something amazing which they just cannot do.  The SPEED of delivering results seems to be the only real feature I can point to where we could win.  That is a super cool feature, but not a ten-figure feature.  In the highshool market I asked more than a dozen coaches if I gave them amazing features at some stupid cheap price could I get them to leave HUDL for scouting.  Not one of them said yes, unless I could get EVERYONE else to switch too.

	If you have time this weekend or early next week I would love to catch up by phone.

	Cheers, 
	Dan

	Quick Analysis on the AAU market

	This is a quick and very dirty analysis.  I would not trust it as definitive, just a quick sniff test really.  I only managed to connect with a handful of coaches.  This is what I found.



	Their seem to be many coaches that are really doing this as a thin margin business, they are coaching younger kids whose parents what them to have fun, or maybe end up good at sports.  But the coaches seem to be far less interested in really developing the kids in systematic ways.  None of them saw value in stats for the low end.

	There is a second class of team.  The elite team.  These guys have money, but they already have services that record the kids and create highlight reels for them.  Even in this area it seemed that keeping stats and using them was just not a priority.  I notice that one could easily use HUDL in these contexts, but no one is doing that.  For these elite teams the cost of HUDL assist is definitely in range, but there seems to be ZERO penetration into this market.  My tentative conclusion is that they just don't care very much about it.  (and the coaches I spoke to agreed with that.)  One coach did say he uses a team mom to keep stats.








	DETAILS


	Focus seems to be on Highlight Reels not on coaching!

	Instagram is big.  Twitter is big.

	``If a player feels they are not getting enough exposure they may pay a service $300 to come out and record a game and put them in their feed’’

	Example promotional companies:  West coast elite, Simply basketball

	For stats most use max prep (but I think stats are just uploaded into this service, even from HUDL) 

	Looks like there is zero usage of HUDL in the AAU leagues.

	For the elite kids they already have services (but still not stats???) for recording them 
	For the younger kids it is really just about developing them (but not using stats)

	He did not seem to think anyone would really care about stats.

	~~~~

	``A team mom takes stats.''

	DAN ASKS: What would parent's pay
	``$100kid for an 8 week season.''
	(Note:  That would be awesome, but I really don't buy this as this guy mostly spoke about how they don't care about stats...  )

	DAN ASKS: What other fees do you pay
	``teams typically pay $500/month for court gym access''








	  The second bigger concern about the idea that we are going to dominate a market is that neither you nor I are B-to-C market specialists.  We are technologists at heart, and leaders at heart.  I know you figure you can just wing that part, but I disagree on this point.  Already the business is operating in a tech-forward kind of way.  That will get you a tech company, but will not get one to dominate a nitch.

	Even if we manage to get a low nine-figure exit it probably does not make sense for me to make a company back flip for that kind of exit right now.  My likely share of 15-20% means that I might not even beat a google salary even if it all wins!  And I think a ten-figure exit requires that you take a chunk out of a big market.  I don't see the market where that can happen.  I don't think you are going to take any notable chunk of the HS market, or college, or pro with a tech-forward play like we are talking about.  Markets often turn out to be larger than you first thought, so maybe somehow one of these other markets can be a ten-figure exit, and maybe you can dominate one.  But I see all of this as a long shot.


	So best of luck, it is a cool idea, and I think the tech and approach is very valid.  I think running this while doing all the other things you are doing is a win for you.  So I would still do it, if I were sitting where you are sitting.  The logic is just different from where I am sitting.

	Strength and Honor!
	--Dan

#### 2021.03.17 - Jason response #2


	Jason,

	calling, calling, calling,  :-)
	Here is my update:

	Market Analysis Update -- The Bad
	--  Part of HUDL's strangle hold on the HS mkt is coach scouting.
		Even coaches that do not care about HUDL or stats *still* get the basic pkg.
		If school A is playing B, they find C that recently played B and ask C for their HUDL of the game.  With a click they get it.  So everyone I asked said they will keep HUDL for this one feature no matter what we provide!!
		(So much for saving money as a feature!  unless somehow our cost is negative.  See the badger league comment below)
	--  Selling to Daddy -- I thought this feature could really differentiate Visio.
		Turns out HUDL assist provides Daddy with a log-on special just for him.
		He can do the same filtering search that the coaches can do.  So Dad already HAS the nifty feature I hoped to give him.  The ability to get a summary of Johnny's play.  Now I agree one can likely build a better UX for Dad than the HUDL interface.  Likely yes.  But enough better that the coach is going to maintain two systems?  Ugh, I am doubtful.  Plus none of this is really building from our core competency of AI auto reco.  That part is just giving us a cheaper price...  which does not help if they need two systems!

	Market Analysis Update -- The Good
	--  The AAU market (dominated by Nike, Adidas, and Under Armor) does not play games against high school teams, so this scouting network is not relevant.  They have money, and some of them really care about winning/player-career/etc.  I am going to try to talk with some AAU coaches from the three major groups and see what tech they use.  Maybe there is a window of opportunity here?  (But notice even if so, HUDL's tech as it exists today applies perfectly here...  It will be a race if they choose to care!)
	-- Several coaches said they would pay for an iPad app that gave them stats at half time, and would pay for stats on their practice games, and after one-on-one sessions with a player.  But for this use case, they were espeically senstive to complexity.  They just want to push a button, so a fixed mounted camera seems required.  But this is just stuff that HUDL *cannot* do at all!



	DAN-O CONCLUSIONS ON THE HIGH SCHOOL MARKET
	-- When it comes to the High School market I am reminded of a bike lock that I had when I was in NYC...  It was called the Fuggedaboutit.  The manufacter never claimed that it was impossible to steal your bike... just that it was so crazy hard that any sane bike thief would simply look elsewhere.  I think it does not matter how perfect our tech is, we are now reduced to competing on price in a very unfair way.  We are not providing stats that HUDL does not provide.  Or maybe we create some UX, or clever usage hack.  I am doubtful these will work, but even if they did, that is not the core tech we are hoping to develop.
	-- The one gap I still see for Visio is SPEED and VOLUME.  coaches that have the money to spend and who love stats, really want those stats FASTER, and they want them on all play even on practice games -- Using HUDL for that starts to get really expensive.  For these fat-cats I bet you could sell them a special second service, on top of HUDL ...  especially if we can somehow hack the HUDL focus camera which they cerrtainly are already using so it also sends video to us too.
	-- But overall my judgement is this is just a Fuggedaboutit market.  
	Lets just look somewhere else for a viable market.  (E.G. maybe the AAU market, or rec gyms are the good market to hit.)






	THE DETAILS


	SCOUTING
	HUDL has a pretty clever pricing model.  For $400/team/year one can get video game tracking...  This is actually their feature of greatest value for most coaches I have talked to.  So why give it away so cleaply?  In order to have total domination of the market.  They get extra value since their HUDL assist is actually able to give stats to the AWAY team without any complexity for the paying AWAY team since the home team also has a hudl video.  It locks the whole market into their ecosystem.  No one wants to mess w. game video that is not in HUDL.  F-ing brillant!

	As one coach with a heavy Italian Brox accent explained:  I know my team, I don't need no spreadsheet to tell me who can rebound and who starts, but I don't know THE OTHER team.  So HUDL scouting is really the key for me.  And getting the game video outside the app from another coach is a hassle for that coach, so that coach probably wont bother -- then I am stuck w/o a scouting video!

	I think this one feature is total killer.  Notice, we CAN provide value that coaches will value and pay for, but we have to do it assuming they are already using HUDL... and probably a HUDL focus.  (most dont seem to really want to screw with video capture from phone, but I don't have hard stats on that... it is more a sense I get.)

	What this means is that if we want to undercut the HUDL price we need to live in the delta between HUDL video @ $400/team/season and HUDL assist @ $900.  Personally I think this is a bad place to be.  If I were HUDL I would raise my video capture to $500 as I consolidate the market and maybe drop my assist price to $800 if Visio were challenging their total dominance even a little bit.  Now @ $300 per season we are at the same price delta as Assist is already at.  
	And notice, for the coas far less complex to get all service from one company.

	Personally I think the network effect from this one feature is just KILLER for this market.  We can sell tech to HUDL, but I dont think we will penetrate this market.  Of course the HS market is not the only market.  but this looks like climbing a nearly smooth cliff face.  A think best just not attempted!




	AN EXAMPLE OF A TEACHER AT A LOW BUDGET SCHOOL
	--> still notice their entire conference mandates that everyone uploads to HUDL
	--> this simplifies the scouting for everyone

	Tyler Kuehl (608-316-1865) at Monona Grove High School

	This school has less money, so they don’t have a hudl focus, but most schools in their conference do.

	They use both hudl and hudl assist.
	-- on Assist:  ``It is huge; it frees me up to focus on the kids’’

	!!!  ``The badger conference in has a rule that all games must be uploaded to HUDL’’

	``Every dollar really counts at our high school.  So it if were cheaper then that would be interesting.’’

	``would definitely be important to have stats at half time.  For both my team and the opposing team’’

	``maybe it would be valuable during the game if it can track; minute breakdown of the players (too see if I am using them too much), to so show me we are taking too many three point shots, and need to get into the pain’’

	``Most schools in our conference have HUDL focus, but we don’t.  It costs too much.’’
	``It is a hassle to have a JV players sit by the iPad I use to record our games and move it around.’’


	DAN ASKS:  ``Any other feature that would really help.’’  after thinking long he says
	``Maybe some body mechanics tracking like the home court app built in could be nice, so I could tell the kid when an angle change on his 3 pointer is causes misses’’

#### 2021.03.17 - Jason response #1



	Jason,

	Some quick comments at the top then lots of details below:
	- Dan's risk aversion.  I think it is the same DanO, but this is a larger commitment AND having Analytics Fire means I have a larger opportunity cost as well.  Still I am down with working for years w/o pay for a good shot at the glory!  (I just want it to ACTUALLY BE a good shot!)
	- I do agree HUDL would likely buy instead of building.  And I do agree if we have this tech, they will be very interested.
	- But I think we are not operating with excellence when it comes to the analysis of the market or nor our analysis of HUDL... details below.




	MARKET ANALYSIS
	- I don't feel we are operating with excellence here.  We are having folks quit jobs, committing $200K, etc.  and we have not gotten 30 customers to tell us they would buy this, what it needs to do, and how much they would pay.
	- Precisely ZERO of the more than a dozen B2C, company owners I have spoken in the past two weeks have given me a passing score in this area.  Most have just given me shit about being amaturish.  (I do admit it HAS been hard for me to get coaches on the phone, but just had two more today...  slowly it goes)
	- Everything I am hearing from existing HUDL users says that you are mis-informated about what HUDL does.
		- It DOES offer video clips of all plays.
		- It DOES break those out by court location, player number, and shot type
		- See the 0:58 mark here:
			  https://www.hudl.com/products/assist/basketball
		  - And this has been confirmed by three different coaches too


	- I hear what you are saying about you and Sam... two scrappy dudes and you made siege!  But I don't think we are really properly thinking about the mechanics of entering a market with **ONE** super dominant player.
	- Yes, they will want to buy us... they have already bought everything in sight, so they want no competition.  But without a second buyer at the highschool level with ANY real penetration, we will not have a good counter bid.  (I challenge you to find the second player with more than 10% penetration, or even 5%!  Just show me ONE.  Notice, HUDL seems to have huge penetration...  e.g. above 80% in at least some states)
	- NETWORK EFFECTS -- All users of HUDL that I have spoken to have mentioned that they have a HUDL package so getting a lower price on one sport will not help them since they already are paying for the whole package.
	- NETWORK EFFECTS -- All users of HUDL also noticed how much they use the sharing features of HUDL and it would be painful to have to work with a non-HUDL coach.


	GLIMMERS OF HOPE -- Here are things of value that HUDL does not do well... and at least one of them, it CANNOT do well w/o our AI:


	``HUDL cannot do real time analytics, and they don’t do analytics on my practice games, if your service could provide those that would be really valuable.’’

	``HUDL does not have long term storage for the videos.  So if a player needs a record of their play for later advancement, I have to tell them I don’t have it.  That is a real loss.” 

	DAN ASKS:  ``what if I could sell parent a $200 package for the season to see just their kids plays at each game’’
	``That sounds really promising.  Right now I always get advertisements for recruiting services that build marketing tapes for your child.
	Given the price of scholarships these days, that is worth real money to the parent’’



	OTHER STUFF I HAVE HEARD

	HUDL USAGE:
	-- Illinois -- ``I don’t know anyone in Illinois that does NOT use HUDL’’ 
	-- Main -- “I am guessing  80 - 85% of the schools in Maine are using HUDL for Basketball ”

	``We have a HUDL package that covers all of our sports, so if you offer Basketball we would need to buy it in addition to this.’’

	``HUDL tags each play with the player, location and shot type so I can filter to see all shots of a certain type by a certain player’’

	``You cannot drop in accuracy relative to HUDL.  At this point I trust HUDL’s scoring record more than I trust my own guys that keep records.’’

	``Your probably going to have to sell at the individual team level… but you should target an entire state or conference at once since the ability to share videos between coaches is key, and if I have to go outside the app to get that video to someone because I am the only one using Dan’s app, that won’t work.  Probably want to give this away for free for a period to get a whole group on board’’

	DAN ASKS:  ``So if I am ⅓ the price of HUDL, but I am 2% less accurate, is that going to be good enough?’’
	``Yeah, maybe for the high school level.  Obviously if you can get to 99.8% accurate that is much better, but maybe that would be ok’’

	DAN ASKS:  ``So what other features would be important to have… ones that would really make a difference’’
	``The more advanced the statistics the better.  Look at what they are doing at the NBA level now.’’
	(NOTE: this was Brian Godzisewski who told me he was a junior coach who does not regularly use HUDL at his level anymore.  So I am a bit skeptical of this answer… seems he doesn’t even use the stats he’s got!)



	REC LEAGUE TEAM MARKET -- The two sales reps I managed to talk to about this were both not bullish on this market... at least not as a stats app.  They claimed that few players would care enough about their stats in order to pay for them -- they did think the premium gyms would pay something for a extra fancy feature.  But they were not clear how much, and it would need dedicated HW.
	==> So if you think this assessment is wrong, then lets find some rec team captains to say it is wrong -- since they are the ones we are claiming will be paying at the gym.  (so far I have only focused on High School since that seemed the better market.)



	BUSINESS MODEL
	- I can tell you like the "fly by the seat of your pant" approach here.  But you are working on at least a back of the envelope financial model right?!?!
	- At a miniumum I would really encourage a financial model estimating the cost of customer acquisition (assuming this must be done one team at a time as I it seems it will need to be)
	- As well as a simple break even model for the business that estimates the number of customers required to hit this point.


	Cheers, 
	Dan









		scheduled another for this morning.)

	HUDL

	RISK AVERSION
	- Its still the same Dan, but I am taking this a larger commitment.  And having Analytics Fire means a larger opportunity cost too.
	


	- We agree having other players in the market is generally a good thing.  
		It proves the market.  and their $500M valuation also sizes the market.
	- Having a _single_ dominant player with a large penetration, and a decade old nation wide sales force is NOT ideal.  It is very hard to take that market from them, and fewer folks to completitively sell to (in that same market)
	- Not comparable to the siege situation much at all.
	- Still, I agree with you, likely HUDL cannot build this tech with their existing team, so likely they will buy it, or less likely build a new team to do it.  (so selling to them could happen, better if they had competition for highschools)
	- Is the Visio MVP a SUBSET of HUDL?
		- HUDL does offer video clips (see the 0:58 mark)
			  https://www.hudl.com/products/assist/basketball
		- BUT the stats are NOT broken out by player; 
			instead by lineup grouping (see 1:20 mark)
		- In my estimation (which could be WRONG :-)  Visio MVP's extra feature of tying the shot to a player is of modest advantage to the coach.
			- In reviewing a game with the team as a whole, looking at all key clips as broken out by turn over, etc. is actually ideal.
			- In one-on-one coaching, having a player-focused summary seems nice.
	- BIG ADVANTAGE -- for me the big (unproven) advantage is that Visio could be sold to each kid's parents, while hudl has more limited value in that context.  (see next "sell to dad" section)
		- I think HUDL could tie shots to players too, but likely would add something like a 50% additional labor cost -- increasing to $6 per game or about $180 per season using Phillippine labor.


	OTHER MODELS
	- SELL TO DAD -- Perhaps the most innovative approach is the "sell to dad" approach which focuses on the lower-accuracy-required task of
		"show me Johnny's highlights" 
		I like this one best since it is quite different in both technology and usage model to HUDL...  but if this is the one we are going for we should validate this market and what the requirements look like.
	- REC LEAGUE TEAM MARKET -- The two sales reps I managed to talk to about this were both not bullish on this... at least not as a stats app.  They claimed that few players would care enough about their stats in order to pay for them -- they did thing premium guys would pay something for a extra fancy feature.
		==> If you think that is wrong, then lets find some rec team captains to say it is wrong.

#### 2021.02.21 - Jason's Basketball Thing


	- With multiple cameras placed high it seems with work we can approach human performance at labelling shot

	- Likely will at least be sellable to HUDL

	- Working with CEO Jason is likely valuable

	- Most other CTO roles would have $100K salary, better team, <= equity, trust
		This situation is probably better

	- Reason to NOT do it, is so I can do my own thing starting in next year.


	-- Tech is tricky, but probably can be made to work almost as good as people.
	-- Market

	-- Consulting is looking like a fail.  Even if it works, its far from 300K/600K
	-- z
	-- Try the BB thing, then google


	- Accuracies need to be quite high (on shots, not assists)
	- Could ask coach to review tricky calls.
	- Shot tracker will be up our tail pipe

	- Not happy to have it be my only iron in the fire.



	Tradeoffs
	-- Value: $3.6M/yr schools * 3x for all other sources = $11M /year  * 4x = 43M 
	    43M * 15% = 6.5M to me...   Discounted by chance of failure 3x == 2M
	-- Could not ferris the situation at all, since I do not control it.
	-- Psychologically I dont own the idea
	~~~~




	Jason, 
	Sorry I am not back to you quicker on this.  I am really struggling to figure out how to make this work.  Here are some parts to give you a glimpse in to my thinking:

	It may not seem like it to you, but the recent year has shown me that I really am in a qualitatively different place than you are.  I have about 3x less cash in the bank than you do, and I am at the moment not able to move from a market that is probably like 2x more expensive than where you are.  I am not gripeing about all of this.  My financial life (and all of my life) is much better than most have it, I am grateful for this!  It just means that I am not "done" earning for the family in the way that you are.

	-- I can put skin in the game in the sense that I *am* in a position to operate w/o a salary for a year or so...  And even after this as a founder I don't expect to just jump to a normal salary, it really depends on our fund raising & income as to how that plays out.  Still I won't be able to keep pace with "zero-income" Syversen in this department.  And dropping cash in at the start is not a healthy move on the family front, and not logical thing to do given my family situation.  (Right now I can take out 80-90K per year out of my saving w/o draining it, and that is just not enough for us to live on in SF.)  The gap in our situations is perhaps the biggest reason to NOT do this.  It could setup a source of friction.

	Still there seem to be some real advantages one might work from here.  I could not tell from your email, but it seemed that your Vision PhD guy flaked on you?  In a certain way I almost hope so, since I think it can lead to a larger synergy.  You mentioned $400K for an MVP, maybe less.  Wow.  I feel that if one does the MVP and does NOT hire a PhD in AI, plus expensive US-based tech talent, that one can get to an MVP for a WHOLE lot less!  This could be a way I can really earn my keep.


	Another approach on this is to use some AnalyticsFire talent for the balance of the system, e.g. the mobile apps, the web interfaces, cloud infrastrucutre, the embedded code on device, etc. (which is well more than 90% of the code of the MVP), AND use AF+DanO for about 3/4ths of the AI vision work.   We have several guys who spent 2+ years delivering a very cutting edge vision-system system to Sunpower using satalight images to build very accurate models of house roofs from really really crappy images -- it was cutting edge work.  We had external vision PhD guys that we contracted with to up our game, but then we did most of the work in-house.  That same team is building a vision-based system for Enphase that automatically checks and validates visual scenes provided by contractors (can give you the details on these projects)  Anyway, there would be details, bandwidth, convincing Nick etc.  But it is a very different model of getting there.

	Just as I did for the Sunpower project, this would require hiring some $70-$100/hr vision specialists...  but really just dozens of their hours per month can really ensure that we are using all of the latest algorithms and approaches.

	Anyway, I am just thinking out loud here, and I really don't know if you already have the vison side covered...  I think it changes the picture some.

	I just have the sense that we should be able to get a prototype which can validate the core idea (maybe even w/ paying customers) in a very time/money compressed way... and that seems valuable for all involved.

	Tell me more about what is up with the current team...  so much of this does depend upon that.

	--dan




	I don't think it would be top-shelf to rely ONLY on this team for the PhD stuff, but my experiences is that you can get a really strong PhD specializing is just the kind of ML/Vision you are looking for in Europe for <$100/hr.  The you use them judiciously  and you can use them 

	-- 

	-- The is the biggest reason to not do this.  With AF my expected ROI is lower unless I create a new-co within AF (which of course is a great idea).  But the thing about AF is that it really does throw off cash, and with a bit more growth it is a lifestyle business.  so if I flush that away, and I say hey honey I will be contributing again above 80K/yr in a decade...  it is just not a good situation.

	-- This is the largest reason to aim for a business that I have some asic control over it, even if in the end I am not making the same level of impact.


	so I am just thinking thru 






	PRO
	- Simple Customer Validation; Customer saying YES
	- Now, technical, ML

	CONS
	- Control


	Suppose consulting co raises to $6M/yr @ 15% profit = $900K/yr   250+450 + 200
		=> Then I stay & do side stuff too

	Suppose we get bat swing w market signal
		=> Then I chase it, over-time for two years, likely longer.
		=> then start pulling salary and dropping operational activities.
		=> After 4 years I am able to slide towards lifestyle business.
	
	Suppose no consulting doubling & no batswing by end of 2022?
		=> Go work for google



	Two choices:
	- Basketball w. Jason, then after 4 years can transition to part time
	- Some Google ML or Robotics team



	FUTURES
	- My Bat Swing
	- Lifestyle consulting gig?
	- Google - as team lead or individual contributor





	Probablility of landing a Strong Customer Signal Batswing in 2 years?

#### STRENGTHS
- Articulate / Persuasive
- Quick conceptual competance
- Creative problem solver
- Sprinter
- Raw conceptual processing power
- Single variable optomization
- Very analytical
- Span the stack from very high level to very low level
- Human optomism; trust; works

- I'm a dreamer  (Over scoping; going too big)
- Sprinter
- Over application of Single variable optomization
- Confusing; story changing too fast
- Big Decision Paralysis
- Time Thief for others; Time theif for self


_
#### SUMMARY
_
##### DEATH OF THE AUTONMY DREAM - FRANKLIN / FERRIS
- _**Franklin**_ did much - he established printers w/ someone else running it
- _**beyond-cash**_ -He wasn't the richest; importantly wasn't trying to get richer
- _**did much**_ -Did not rest!  He accomplished what his innate abilities allowed. 
- _**99% cant**_ try.  Could do much since no one else is there.
- _**lost?**_ - beyond-cash used to seem possible for me
- _**long shot**_ - Now is seems more of a long shot
- VALUES:  fits w. dan ideas; impact

##### Big Rocks
- CMKS >30-40% - Take shot on product goal
- AF-AUTONOMY >40-50% - Take shot on lifestyle goal
- VISIO - Try it first; leave if sucks
- GOOGLE - Train up for specialty so I can have a little fun


1. Is being a painter my number one
2. x
3. Not Jason vs. 


##### ROLLUP
- **ALL IN MCKS** -- It is a risky all-in bet right now.
	AF very unstable now; might be around afterwards.
	Else go to Google if all fails.
- **AF-FIRST** is on borrowed time. if I am going to do uniform is must be soon.
	If doing AF lifestyle first it will be years before stability
	If doing AF lifestyle at same time, one will suffer significantly
	- Requires 10x revenue for success than Visio
- **Visio** seems a higher probability success (than some unnamed AF approach)
	=> Negotiate Equity w. Jason / Verify actuality / 
	=> Drive hard to build solution (Small time for CMKS)
	=> After 2 years kick off side project in MCKS
	=> After 4 years drop to fewer hours & crank on CMKS  (trusting in equity!)
	??? - talk candidly w. Jason about side gig @ 2Y
	??? - side gig, edit equity if raise on it.
- **Google-Next**, get stuff published to protect IP & get feedback
	Then to Google having an MCKS "hobby"
	Retire after 8 years to work on MCKS or other stuff
- **Ditch Autonomy Dream -- No MCKS; No Franklin** 
	Visio: Fun leadership, Learning techical, 
	Google: good pay, (goof around w/ info systems on side)
	GAI: Go deep on gai, then Google self


##### ALL-IN-MCKS - What would this look like?
- AF - work many hr/wk to keep pushing for AF stability & AF-lifestyle. AND
- FEEDBACK ON
	- Presentation & Detailed Examples; Feedback on: 
		- Value Markets; 
		- Corp KM; 
		- OpenSrc DataBricks
	
- COMMUNITY
	- Smallest prototype to support a community (w support)
	- Build tiny DIY community
- RAISE OR BOOTSTRAP


##### APPROACH
- -> CMKS Feedback -> If no traction, then hobby
- AF-lifestyle 


##### DECISION TREE
**BIG Q**: am I going to have a real DAN-IDEA bat swing?
- YES: 	 then stay with AF and make it happen in 2021-2022
			very risky.  50/50??  and need to really focus on it.
- NO: 


ANSWERED QUESTIONS:
**CHILL Q**: CAN I CHILL w. <$100K for 5 years?
- YES: 	then maybe do that with AF, looking for a DAN-IDEA to drive
- **NO**:	I am going to need to earn.  cannot use 1/2 years before retire.

**CONSULTING CO Q**: Turn AF towards lifestyle consulting biz in <1 year
- YES: 35%  NO: 65%

**AF BAT SWING Q**: Can we generate AF batswing in <1.5 years
- YES: 40%  NO: 60%.    ?????? 

Q: GOING TO TAKE RISK ON AF or JASON
- AF:  	well chances are 50/50 (or less)
- JASON:	then leap for Jason and leave in 12mo to Google (or AF) if it sucks


##### CORE IDEAS
- **CMKS** - Compo-Minimal Knowlege Systems
- **Knowledge Mgt** - 


##### Framing to Jason
- The Good: 
	Solid-team, specific-strong-idea, 
	My role is primarily technical leadership in area w/ significant experience
- The Bad:
	On path to towards impact projects.
	Time delay to cash


##### THINKING
CMKS -- Greatest driver is CMKS.  
- 50/50 chance I could shoot for a real business there.
- If I don't do it now, likely never will
JASON
- 4 years output should be much greater than $4M @ 15% = $30M sale = $10M/yr ~10K customers
- If I leave @ 4yr my 15% is in jeopardy
- Cannot Feriss this
- Will require landing multiple markets or massively dominating one.
AF

FERISS
- Business that is stable and throws off $1M profit is lifestyle
- Needs > $3M revenue


JASON OR GOOGLE AT EMOTIONAL LEVEL
?? Jason?
++ Potentially Greater Control
-- Money could feel weird, but after year 2 if >150K and thriving bus, then ok


JASON OR AF lite + on side driving towards DAN-IDEA
AF-lite (but not so likely to work)
-- 30-40% chance that we can figure out strong consulting model
-- Letting me earn >200K @ 15/hrs week


JASON VS AF PRODUCT
AF-product
SOLID PRODUCT:  < 50/50
-- feels so much safter to be in control the business
-- will need hard work for several of years, but if aiming lifestyle then
   maybe some relaxing.  maybe.
IFFY PRODUCT:
-- Better to go with Jason, at least I am focused on tech & cool tech

				 Autonomy, 
				 Consciousness
				 
HOW?
-- Directly fund a "my-idea" and try to make a go of it.
-- Stablize a lifestyle income and use that to provide freedom.
	-- AF business.  Already in motion.  Easier to control bus shape at AF
	-- Jason business.  



MY NORTH STAR

	- Time divided by responsibilities (~3h/day)
	- I am an ideas guy, dont get in flow on execution
	
- Failing at
	- Getting out of the house
	- Marketing
	- Picking a path
	- Maintaining momentum

- What I am good at / not good at
	- Seeing different way to do big-picture items
	- Technical depth
	- Selling an idea, Instilling confidence

1. +Keep on getting my bucketed actions to be more efficient.  am on track now
4. >PushToStartup:  RemP
2. -Dan Next: Train ML, think next jobs
3. \AF: Epri/Embedded
5. ?Uf????


MAIN THING:  Need to gain focus around best "next startup" to drive towards

SIDE THINGS:
- continue getting bucketed actions more efficient
- add exercise into the weekly mix in a sustainable way
- Dan Project: Uf?

I don’t know how I might use Uniform in the future, but I won’t use my ownership of it to thwart aims that NDA puts significant and (hopefully ongoing) effort against.

Informal:
 If NDA starts doing a thing w. Uniform, then I never stop it, or try to own it.
 if NDA does not stick with a thing, or never really puts significant effort against a goal, then that goal is fair game for me to later own

### 2010.12.17 – LESSONS FROM DATING ELAINE

lesson

- I could not face the conclusions I was coming to.  So I did not.  but I also did not act.

- My expectations (rules) about how this should be froze me away from breaking up, and away from marrying.  neither met criteria, but by sheer force of will I imagined I could change one or the other.  Or at least fantasized that I could (Even thought at another level I expected I could not).

### 2010.10.00 – Gave up on Siege

It occurred to me after our phone call yesterday, that ours was one of the best business relationships that I never had.  I was worried early on, based on the comments coming from STO, but I have found them to be quite groundless.  There have been several times when it was clearly in your best interest to simply let things ride along w/o comment—after all you were getting effort for free.  But you (or at least your wife) took it upon yourself to be explicit about assumptions being made.

In the end, it turns out that integrity is one of the most prized attributes in close partnerships.  Many folks believe they are operating with integrity, but integrity is not defined by your actions when there would be consequences, it is defined by those rare moments when there would NOT be consequences.  I think you have the right stuff to lead a successful organization—and for the kind of business you are shooting for—it is so critical that folks *want* to work with you, to trust in you.

I think early on you were really ready to open up to significant sharing.  You pushed for something safe for both of us.  Later you conveyed our lowering sense of opportunity in a good, open way.  Several times being explicit about it—all good stuff.  From my point of view this time was well worth it.   I really did put quite a bit of mental energy in this direction, but it pushed me to think about my time post DARPA, and gave me an inside look at starting my own gig.

In 20-20 hindsight, I would have played the game of the last year a little differently.  Playing around with SBIRs was probably not the right game.  Given that you were already in motion the night we first spoke, and I was mentally quite far from leaving DARPA, I needed a “shoot the moon” as a strategy for catching up.

I needed to pitch work (white papers) that were generally separate from your current thrusts.  It is hard for that to work, since you would still be the one shopping those papers around.  Still it was really what was needed.  Winning work off of such a paper would be the basis for a quarter of Siege.  Winning a SBIR even two, would not qualify.  Especially if you have Joe doing the same w. little equity!  It just doesn’t add up.

I am not quite sure what to make of the fact that I did not even manage to achieve this lower goal.  In a certain sense it was a partial test, there was never enough riding on a SBIR to merit putting in sustained effort.  Still, it makes me question if I am too far from cyber to play that game.  I don’t think that is true.  My belief about AI+cyber is essentially unchanged.  Still it does give me pause…

At this point I think I am too late to get enough of Siege for it to make sense.  I do plan to continue down this path of pitching a Cyber program (at least if management gives positive signals).  If I do move in that direction post DARPA there may be some way to share equity across two inter-related companies which affords the right up sides for both of us.  I don’t know, but I am open to it.

In the end, I am convinced that you are the kind of person I would trust to work with—I would want to work with.  I am also convinced that the world is more win-win than anything else.  Whenever possible it is better to pool resources rather than going it alone.  So who knows, I don’t see the way forward right now, but I would be looking for that way forward.

Best luck with Siege!

### 2010.10.09 – Organizing Self

FOCUS – I can do many different things, but I jump from idea to idea way too quickly.  
- At DARPA there are so many efforts that have never gone anywhere, but I never ran into a wall, I just got working on something else.
- With Jason/Siege I never put the work in necessary to join siege, but still put much work in.
- In my research I have jumped from place to place

MAJOR TASKS
- NewStart
- Mgt MR/BL
- Admin
- NextJob
- Decision
- Fun


MY RESEARCH FOCUS – Teachable systems
This is consistent w. my work from: IBM, from BL, and Cyber or ISR.

–  work @ IBM

### 2010.04.01 – Life is moving faster

There is much less time, than I am pretending there is.  But less that needs doing as well.
- Need to ensure that the important stuff is getting done.
- Need to ensure that each day is lived the way I want it to be lived.
- Need to be strategic in leveraging my activities.  Too often I build the first half but don’t reap the benefits.

- Need to be strategic in spending time.  I kill too many hours in less than effective ways:
   Meetings/calls that take too long.  Getting to into the details.  Procrastinating.  Piddling on small stuff.
   Working on tasks that are not the most impt.

- Days must have space & periods of fast activity.

- Should have few activities in each bucket, then keep coming back, so each activity is pushed to a place of value.
- 



BUCKETS OF ENERGY
Project – personal “fun” projects – these can also have other value but must be fun.
Career – Pushing my career forward – beyond my day job
Work – My day job
Spiritual – Spiritual growth
Family&Friends – Paying attention to those that matter
Mate&MyFamily – D 
Self – Health, Finance, Possessions, Capabilities

PROJ:  TightKeys, ConfigTool, ?jason?
CAREER:  Jason, Pubs, StartupContacts, 
WORK:  Fewer more focused hours.  
FAMILY&FRIENDS:  Just a bit of time from time to time
MATE:  Make a decision
SELF:  Pretty on track.  Focused hours

### 2010.01.02 – From last year’s retreat  (12/2008)

RETREAT

- Samati tips   (extracting feelings & others)

- Value of depth?
  - Centrality of the body experience now

- After 5 months what do you personally believe
  * Life after
  * souls connected 
  * loving presence (beyond the psy effect)

=============================================================

Pat,

This is Dan Oblinger (or Dan 244 as known on the retreat).
Thanks much for your sincerity and energy on the retreat, they helped set the rhythem 
of the retreat for me.  I don't know what it felt like inside yourself, but to me
I felt a calmness and clarity that I attributed to your recent 5 month adventure.
I think it was a great gift for all of us, to receive you so close to your period of 
intense study.




I wanted to thank you for the retreat.

### 2009.12.29 - Elasticity of Time
This morning
1.5h	bed	0
1h	ready	.5
.5	walk	.5
1.5h	food	.5
2h	web	0
6.5		1.5

Lesson learned.  In all cases I need to get to my focused hour *immediately*
That focused hour must be fun too so I want to do it

### 2009.12.19 - personal update
Things are not great.  I am at a place of very low motivation.  
My current situation is reinforcing some habits that are not great:
No movement with elaine… by having big ideas, but no progress (just putting stuff onto lists), 
Expending the energy to *do* into doing small things (clean house)
Cant break free of existing commitments long enough to hit bottom and take new course, whole weeks are going by, where I am just exhausted in the evening, and only put off anything … everything till the next day…. When it all happens again.

Will attempt new habit:  Morning Default

### 2009.11.22 – Joe Laconti


* Idea of a building up model spirituality from observations from stmts scientist would accept about world (social world)

* Self Enrichment reading group

* your spiritual drivers / goals / life goals

### 2009.11.19 – Progress

TIME & PROGRESS
•	Life is structured so I often don’t get time for the most important personal things
•	Worse yet, I am biased away from such thinking/activites
•	More still, I don’t really have a plan when I do get time, so it is frittered easily.

I have the sense that even when I do get time, it gets spent w. little consequence.



RESOLUTION – When personal time is available:
•	I need to organize what I most want to get from the time.
•	Around that I need to build a plan.
•	I need to spiritually ground and connect my reasons for action.
