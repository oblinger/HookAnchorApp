- [ ] Fix circuit breakers


Zarina, My comments come from thousands of miles away from any conflict or risk, so I want to start w/ more humility than I did in my first post.

I am not a fan of Putin, nor this war. And I would not try to put the problems of ordinary Russians in the same category of those faced now in Ukraine. that would be crazy.

You said you have fought against facism your whole life. I believe you.
