Vanguard:
I recently called regarding a deferred compensation account that I have with Vanguard.  I did not leave that call with confidence that I have taken all actions as required by the IRS for this account.  When it comes to the IRS, ignorance is definitely NOT an acceptable excuse, and penalties incorrect process associated with a defered compensation or pension accounts can be quite severe!

Let me summarize my situation in hopes of gaining clarity about appropriate actions to take:

- Several years ago I set up a deferred compensation plan.  I was not in a position to set this program up thru my international employer who was paying me 1099 consulting income.  
- Instead I created a sole proprietorship in my name, and accepted the 1099s as income into this sole proprietorship which in turn was paying me this money.
- This allowed me to defer some income from this account into two newly created Vanguard accounts.  ACCT NUMBERS:
   - Account—10257779 -- Dan Oblinger 401k Plan and Trust -- Account Balance $0K
   - Account—10257800 -- Dan Oblinger Defined Benefit Plan Interest -- Account Balance $396K
- This year I have notified the IRS of my closure of these deferred compensations accounts, which requires me to roll those funds into a qualified accounts.
- But right now they are already in tax deferred accounts at Vanguard.

Questions #1:  So I don't NEED to roll the funds anywhere since they are presently in a pretax account, and they are STILL in a pretax account just as they should be.  Is this correct?

Question #2:  If I do want to consolidate my accounts, then it would be fine for me to move those funds into my IRA account:  NUMBER:
- this is the correct account, since it is pre-tax and tax deferred just as the deferred comp plan is tax deferred.  It should not go either the brokerage account or the roth account as both are NOT matching.  Correct?

Question #3:  Mixing the funds from the two deferred comp accounts into my IRA will not in any way limit or taint original deferred comp funds, nor existing IRA funds.  At this point in time they both have the same actions available, and same limitations on them, so mixing them will not limit either one in any way.  Correct?

Question #4: It is my understanding that these accounts will be deleted after two years of having a zero balance.  Correct?  Is there any faster way to make them go away?

Thanks in advance for your help.
