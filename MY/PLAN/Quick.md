- I am in a large holding pattern right now, that I must break free from
- I have a lot of living left to do, which I can still do in this life, but which I am not doing right now


- I have a couple of ideas (Forum, EduCorp, EOCA, Notester) that I need to get into the world at least a bit.  (Probably not as my paid job)

- Joy for me is a certain kind of thinking/doing:
	- It only seems to happen in limited degree in paid work.
	- It is the working out of details in my head:  Uniform
	- It is a certain kind of careful, completionist, organizing:  Obsidian, The basement boxes  (and pushing it to a certain kind of completion)
	- It is (often save the world) systems thinking: EduCorp, Forum, ElasticBlockChain




Love doing:  working-out-in-my-head-details, help-humanity, big-picture

High cost.  Any way to amortize over more
