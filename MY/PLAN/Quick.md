I will answer your question, but first I want to put you on the spot in a friendly way:
You are claiming it is "obvious" that non-biological women should not be in same sex bathrooms.  ok.  But you should then be able to state the principle you are using to support this.  Please finish this sentence, I have tried but cannot:

Subgroup A can be excluded from a communal resource for benefit of group B WHEN ...

If you cannot finish that sentence in a defensible way, then perhaps you are still correct about women's bathrooms, but clearly it is not "obvious"


You say these cases are not parallel, but the ARE parallel in the sense that both fall under the first half of the sentence I wrote above.

I do see the many huge differences between those cases.  But that is not enough, I need to "hang my hat" on one of these differences and use that to declare them as non parallel.

For example: damages to group B.  One can argue that 'damage' to whites was not large enough to support separate-but-equal.  just be careful, if one can show 'damages' to bio-women are smaller, then you need to merge bathrooms.  Or you might argue that if 'damages' to group A are not too large then it is ok to exclude.  But be careful that seems to suggest (and surprisingly YOU seemed to be suggested) that if one made separate but equal REALLY equal, then it would be ok.   (I personally would NOT be ok with separate but equal even in this case because I think it fuels identity politics.)

So I am not saying these are the same.  No two cases are EVER the same.  Rather I am saying I

Let me first answer your questions:

What do I think about delta between whites and blacks:  I agree with the statement that you have made in the past that from a genetic perspective these are such mixed bags, there are few traits that are really genetic.  There are SOME.  e. g. rates of cycle cell anemia are much higher in an average "black".  Still all evidence is that if there is a genetic delta relating to cognition it is VANISHLY small.  For practical purposes we can consider it zero.  Cultural differences are quite large inside some sub populations, however.  For example rates of single parenting and rates of reading with children correlate with subgroup memebership far far more than they correlate with any other demographic.  So in-group cultural difference are large and important.  At the same time, nearly every study of bias shows that nearly every human is very biased based on skin color.  We treat resumes different, traffic stops different, etc.  We are very racist -- or at least we are very race aware.  So I see large cultural out-group differences too.   I used to 'blame' in-group 'black' culture more.  But as I have thought more deeply about this over the years, I realized that even though each individual effect is small and surmountable, if you have a continuous barrage of such small effects they will be cumulative until their are nearly unstoppable.  So their effect taken as a whole can be MASSIVE.  Just as the role of ones mamma and ones community can be massive.

I would need to see some kind of factor analysis to have an opinion about whether I think in-group or out-group culture is "more" at fault here. 

about the hurdles still faced today, I am no longer think this.  The out-group effects are SO pervasive and SO large too.  (I also don't think it is very productive to pick a side to 'blame more' when both sides have plenty of legitimate blame on their side.)

A bio-woman has XX chromosomes (plus a few more details to handle edge cases).  A social-woman is one that operate in society as a woman.  (kinda looks/dresses that way, uses names and affectations typical for bio-women.)  The choice to define 'woman' as bio-women or social-woman as a default is a political one.

No question there are many very salient genetic differences between bio-woman and bio-man.  Large delta in tendency towards violence is very likely among them.  So man/woman white/black are starkly different in these ways.

... deep down you think there is more to it than that.  You seem uncomfortable admitting ... because people will label you as racist.

So I do think there are subgroups of blacks that are much less likely to marry, much less likely to read to their children, and many other things.  (also subgroups of whites who are limited by their culture too).  I believe that, and can get called racist for it.  I don't know if there is some other belief that I have that I am uncomfortable with??

... I don't think you have thought about questions of [what is like to be black, female] very deeply.

Hmmm.  Well I have tried... Still I acknowledge, I have never lived as part of a truly oppressed minority group and had to just 'suck it up' day in and day out.  So at some visceral I will never "get" it no matter how hard I try.   Like a fish trying to "get" what it is like to walk upon the land.  I think my limited perspective makes it likely that I will under-value the importance of certain things.  But those are PREDICTABLE things I will under-value, thus I have taken it upon myself to scruitinize the holy fuck out of those things to try to value them correctly.  It is difficult for me to know how well I have succeeded in correctly valuing these predictable short sightedness.

I will leave you one to ponder.  I really am not trying to say this factor should be the deciding one.  But this is an area where both you and I might be under-valuing its importance.

According to this rule then we SHOULD allow trans into woman's bathroom if occurrence of violence turns out to be vanishly small.  (Comparable to overall violence a woman might experience in biologically segregated bathroom.  Ok, we can determine this empirically over time... I am not sure the result will be the one you favor.)

According to this rule then we should also weight the damage inflicted on the excluded group.  In your other email you challenged (and I acknowledged) that I may not correctly understand what it is like to be a woman or black.  In this second case both you and I may not correctly understand what it is like to be trans.  Here is my personal attempt at this:

Humans are very tied to their identity, whatever identity they happen to select as salient.  An attack on identity is often among the most visceral felt, as measured by the magnitude of the response elicited.  In the case of a trans-woman, this biological-man's identity and entire LIFE is organized on a moment-by-moment basis around the support-of and adherence-to a socially-female role.  this is so central to their very definition of themselves that they structure all parts of their social interactions around this framing.

Rightly or wrongly they frame any social acknowledgment of their biological status as an attack on this social-woman identity.
