## PROJECTS
### OBS Tabular Title
- Each kind of table has an table indicator REGEX
- Each kind of table has title data field REGEX (used to extract title from entry's markdown page)
- Table maintains bidirectional link between table entry and the title field value
- All rows with no indent up to a double blank line are the table entries.
- All text beyond the first @ link is the title of the table entry (it is the synced part)


### Bidirectional sync to gsheets
- [coupler.io](https://blog.coupler.io/python-to-google-sheets/)   has some good ref material for py-bindings
- scan three level hiearchy with direct content or links to next level down
- map key value pairs into a table row
- build URL links to local files
- Format Idea:
	- leading space indicates positional arguments (can be wiki-link, markdown-link, key: value-pair, trimmed string with spaces)


## LATER
- [ ] PKM: Use ^a ^e to select whole line to move?  
- [ ] OBS: Synthetic todo list views - 
- [ ] https://github.com/jigish/slate  -  KICK window into position 1, 2, 3 and back  (Mess with SLATE)
