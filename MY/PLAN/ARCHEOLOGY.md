SELF SUMMARY
Inventor (dozen+ patents & companies), traveller (5 continents), professor (ivy league), government agent (the secret kind), charming billionare batchelor who fights crime from a secret high tech cave below his mansion…. oh wait that’s batman.

Truly though, I would not trade in my decades of doing, but it has helped me keep my head buried deeply in my rear. I have been building much, but not the things that matter most. It has been easy to do, I look ten years younger than I am (actually 46); blessed with an awesome circle of friends and partners, it has been easy to pretend I was going to have all of this AND the 2.3 kids, my trusted dog living in my white picketed front yard.

Well no more. I am still the CTO for a startup, but I have re-structured my responsibilities (and my equity) in order to make finding my mate, my number one priority. Not rushing, but my plan is to apply the same focus I have put to other things into this one. I am betting I will have my best luck offline, but leaving no rock unturned I am online too… (you know, not that I am saying we are under a rock here at OkCupid)


REALLY GOOD AT
Thinking differently in ways that have impact.

FIRST THINGS PEOPLE NOTICE
Contagious enthusiasm.


FAV BOOKS
Ethnic and spicy—food! I am talking about food. You know, a killer salsa or Kimchi Chigae. Movies/Books: Murikomi, Chinua Achebe, Miyazaki, David Allen (yes, I am list nerd), and always up for the latest in mindless mainstream whatever as long as it is NOT horror, and I am out w. good friends.


SIX THINGS I COULD NEVER DO WITHOUT
Intelligent conversation.
Close friends.
My 14 hour laptop battery . . . it lets me work all day in the craziest places.
My Hybrid Bike—probably the way I will travel to meet you.
Marty, my over fed, and oh-so-happy tabby.
Love


SPEND TIME THINKING ABOUT
everyTHING. For me everything is a THING—a puzzle to solve and to talk about! World Politics, yesterday’s movie plot, how our friend should manage some problem with his boss, anything spiritual, anything scientific. Am always building a better mousetrap—on the ski-lift how to cover more runs with one lift, or a self-sustaining vocational training scheme to educate and create jobs in Africa. On the Internet—a new kind of message board that forces conservatives and liberals to talk to each other rather than talking past each other.

TYPICAL FRIDAY
Out on a date, dinner with friends, … or snuggled at home with takeout and the latest Myazaki flick.

MOST PRIVATE THING
As a grade schooler I was convinced that girls could all read minds, but they just weren’t letting on. To catch you guys I would try to suddenly think of some shocking thing (you know, shocking for a ten year old), then watch for inadvertent reactions in nearby girl’s faces. Really even today… how can I know for sure???


YOU SHOULD MESSAGE IF
You’re sexy and ya’ know it *grin*
