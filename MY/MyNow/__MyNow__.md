### Religious toleranc

This seems an issue of legitimate disagreement in this country.
Some honestly see same-sex couples as a natural and healthy thing.
Others see it as unhealthy and evil. Which group on earth is qualified to determine who is right?
An honest question: Shouldn't we be working to have Christian schools that don't discriminate, and others that do? It seems wrong to me, for the government to force the opinion that same sex IS moral. By forcing all religious schools to adopt a specific practice we are effectively having the government take a moral stance here.
NOTE: it seems very reasonable that the government ensure that there are Christian schools available that are same-sex affirming. after all 53% of the population is in favor of this, so it would be wrong to have a coalition of Christian churches block other churches. But it seems just as wrong to have a government lead coalition.
This note is not intended to be confrontational. I am honestly questioning this.

### Scoot

Scoot,
This is Dan "Three-eyed-raven" Ex-altar boy here.  I must say the scoot-at-night show has transformed things for me ... It just shuts my Effing brain DOWN!

But I must also say your assertion that your stuff is not spiritual is way off the mark!!  MOST of your stuff has got a monty-python-esque slant that feels like it draws heavily on your personal history.  Besos is in **Purgatory** with the founder of J.C. Penny?  Nuns in space?  A flat-world-like story about goddesses manipulating humanity with a not-good/not-evil dicotomy drawn from some kind of princess-mononoke-like philosopical world view.

Really?!?  There is alot of stuff rolling around that head of yours!

I just listened to the good humor story, and learned that "beyond the binary" does not mean "on the other side of this podcast line" as I originally imagined.  Instead it indirectly indicates the Borgean library of ambuguity, the half-connected-logic, into which you bathe our brains.  Like dreaming itself, everything is connected, and everything is yet a bit of another thing.

In my youth I was part of a Dr. Who style club where we each of us had rediculously long, descriptive titles.  Mine was abbreviated to: ``Your most non-binary verbosity'' --- indicating my penchant for seeing (and loquaciously expounding upon) the grey bits of ambiguity found at the boundaries of even the most bright of lines.  Maybe I missed my calling... I think perhaps I do have evidence I too can put people to sleep!

I am waiting for the rest of the good humor story!  But that one is far too engaging for me to sleep, that one I will stay awake for...


but that is ok, I will sleep on the next.








Concrete suggestion:  
-- Create a second patreon feed with similar or the same content.  

WHY: I would use this so my feed does not run dry.  I listen to your feed with "delete after play" set.  I want it to run on auto-pilot, I have a dedicated ipad and bluetooth headband speaker.  At night I do not want to look at my screen, just press the 'play' button on the headband that is already on my head.  This works quite well, but occasionally I run out of feed.  Since I often sleep thru it, I would not mind having them play a second time... I could always fast forward if I needed to.

bonus:  I think you want to do everything you can, to keep people from keeping your episodes.  too tempting to stop the service!  a second feed might help.

### Ryan

Ryan,
Thanks for taking the time to respond! If you don't mind indulging me further, I would love to get your critical assessment a bit further. It is remotely possible that some action might even come from this thinking…
My aim is to NOT spend (much) more money per student, yet partially address this issue. The not spending more money part is the hard part of course, but if it is solvable, then it has a greater chance to be implemented.
The idea is to have:
(1) a SINGLE bootcamp school for an entire city the size of Baltimore. So even though the cost per student per day is much higher than a traditional school, since we only have ONE, the city-wide cost per student is negligible.
(2) to make this happen, students have to actively and dramatically NOT want to go to this school, so even for a difficult student, they actively choose to avoid being sent there. (If they don't mind going to the school, then we run out of room at our expensive school.)
(3) the central (proposed) benefit is that as a teacher you can require a basic level of cooperation and if they can be placed in detention at your school. If they don't comply you can escalate at any hour of any day to their immediate transfer to this school, just for the night, or for a week.


As I see it, the problem with suspension and detention is that they are

### CONSEQUENCES in the classroom
CONSEQUENCES.
It seems to me that in our effort to have "no child left behind" we have gone astray. But I wonder your thoughts on the matter, you might not agree.
We correctly note that when we suspend a student, prison other legal actions, chances are higher that they will fail in life. From this we conclude that we should minimize these corrective actions when we can.
My theory is that this is not a good path. Seems to me that we all need consequences tied to actions as a way of shaping behavior. And failing to have consequences early on, allow behaviors to become progressively worse.
That said, it seems we should have (1) certain, (2) compelling, but (3) temporary consequences, so one can learn. It also seems that our lack of rigorous enforcement of consequences on a few, has significant impact on many within those same classrooms.
So as I imagine it, we would have rigorously enforced, quick response, quick relief consequences.
But you are living it, in a Baltimore public school, and I am not. Tell me what you think:
We both know suspension damages education, so it is best avoided. What if instead of this we had a "bootcamp" school. The cost per student per day is probably 4x the cost for a normal class. The students have therapists on staff, and strong physical controls with pretty limited interaction with other students. No TV, no 2-way Internet. Significant physical chores each day, as well as their daily lessons captured via smartphone from their classroom.
My idea is that this place would be LESS FUN than most any other life choices, and so it would be avoided at all costs. Any student that repeatedly ended up in this spot, likely has strong enough emotional problems, that they inadvertently end up there. So those students need specialized theraputic help.
In my imagination, have such a "low-damage, quick fix" at your fingertips would be transformative in your classroom. You would just say: ``billy, sit down now and be quiet, or you will spend 1/2 hour after class on extra homework.'' …. he knows from experience if he does not stay after for his extra homework, he will spend a week in bootcamp. He knows this with CERTAINTY, that this will be his consequence. Its just 1/2 hour, but if he does not do his 1/2, then his WHOLE NEXT WEEK will be no fun at all.
How many times do you think he will need to learn this lesson? Many others will learn of this CONSEQUENCE by just watching what happened to Billy.


So I know the purpose of your post was very much a heart felt quandry about very real choices you are forced to make. Sorry for high-jacking your post to ask this question. But you are the right one to ask.
Would it work? Would it be good? Would it transform your classrooms?
Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

### scooter

Scooter:

What a great response you gave.  No need for you to keep up that kind of volume, you have a podcast to produce!  Still, but I feel compelled to write back on a number of things, so I already know I will ramble...

YOU WARNED:
>> I did two entire seasons (about 30 episodes) of a series I wrote called "Nuns In Space" where I was on a spaceship with the nuns from my childhood. 

Right.  I have already heard one of them, but the nuns did not figure much into that one.  I am very much looking forward to your trials with the Nuns.
That whole idea strikes me as hilarious and harmless.  (Remember I have nuns in my past as well).  No real trauma from that past, but well Nuns are Nuns as you know.

YOU WROTE:
>> I'm not sure if the old gods and new will ever come back on the show or not but I will keep your feedback in mind for sure.

I think it was just the specific act of actually praying to them that caught me.  (That said, the prayers themselves were quite funny, and kind of genius too.  They were strange scooter dialed up to ELEVEN.)  I thought the prayers were a regular part of your program… they are not... Got it!

YOU WROTE:
>> I had a discussion with our community a few years the consensus was that trigger warnings would be more disruptive than do good.

Where is this community?  A chat group?  Would be fun to join.  Yeah I agree with them.  The last think you want to do for folks that think too much is to give us another thing to think about!!!

YOU WROTE:
>> The overall feel of the podcast is very on that level of weirdness and that is just the tip of the iceberg so if you are concerned about any of that level of stuff getting into your subconscious you should be aware that most of the content is on that odd side of things and you may want to consume the podcast with caution.

Thanks for the warning, but Scoot at level eleven is really quite genius stuff.  I need something like that to pull on my brain. Somehow the combination of locally clever turns of phrase and unexpected connections keeps me engaged, yet the explicit chaos that it is embedded into causes my brain to not try to follow.  

Also on the rare occasions where I have been relaxed enough to watch my brain drift into sleep…. Those moment before sleep are EXACTLY like the chaos of meaning that somehow you are able to channel while you are awake.  I wonder if your chaos kind-of weaves in with the listener's chaos and kind of jump starts it??  Dunno.


YOU WROTE ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS
 as you probably know from your business most of that time I was supporting the podcast with a full-time day job. ….   lots of support at $1/$2 but I am hoping to keep slowing growing
 
Got it.  Yeah that is not quite the level I thought.  Still brand reputation is very very slow moving ball, but once it is rolling it is also slow to stop.  We both live in the Bay Area, so I know that it takes a really healthy lifestyle-business to pay the bills.  (I am six years into my lifestyle business, and perhaps a bit a head of you, but with greater existential risks looming for the business)  I feel your podcast is a pretty sticky product, and at least folks like me are quite grateful so willing to continue dropping the coin even after our need diminishes.  

Your focus on keeping a free service is both a smart business move, and is also aligned with making the biggest difference.  …  and it energizes your community!


=== DETAILED USAGE ===
In my case, I can fall asleep anytime anywhere.  But once I have had three hours of sleep if I wake and start thinking about anything intellectually challenging it wakes me up.  Even 2 minutes of concentration will put enough juices in my blood stream that I can feel the difference 30 minutes later.

Thus if I wake, it is essential in the first 5 minutes that I really try NOT TO DO ANYTHING.  If I make it back to sleep all is well, else I am up for 3 hours, until I get tired again.  So I pee before bed, water is right next to my pillow, as are cough drops, extra covers and pillow.

Fiddling with logins for a phone, or buttons on a podcast reader are a definite no-no.  The solution is this hands free bluetooth eyemask headphone thing (see below)  I have a dedicated ipad that is paired with this headset.  It is on my head when I sleep, so when I wake I can just press my "three eyed raven button in the middle of my forhead....  and Scooter starts talking.

The ipad will remember the correct app, and the headphone paring, so I can start scooter with a single press on the button on my forhead even after 24 hours off.  It allows me to "Boot the Scoot" as soon as I am aware that I am awake.  This is MAGIC.  It greatly increases the chance of an immediate return to the nether world...

and I feel like the three eyed raven each time I press that little button.

### bootstrapping intelligence
Erik, nicely thought out piece, and I agree that Sci Fi has all the right ingredients by usually it is small differences that make all the difference. Asimov wrote a futurist piece that I read, and is predictions were kind of right, but mostly irrelevant.
But I feel your analysis of deep fakes is a bit off the mark. Here is an analogy: We have shown that indexed mutual funds can perform as good as active investors, but no one believes this would continue if we replaced ALL active investors with indices, there would be no "original content" to copy!
Measuring how well ML can ape humans is not relevant to how close they are to replicating the thoughts required to produce a NOVEL style. This is the more important measure.
Still all that said, I believe that we have already constructed much of the machinery needed to build the first self-bootstrapping intelligence. THAT intelligence will grow like a baby does, and construct its own theory of mind. 
My take is that we are like physicists doing science before the construction of the first atomic bomb. We might theorize what effects such a chain reaction would have, but until we light one up, we are not going to really see that reaction for ourselves.
In a similar way, the behavior of our non-chain-reacting intelligences will always look quite different from our chain-reacting intelligence. UNTIL we build the other one. Then just as alpha-go in one step moved computer go from the back waters to beating all humans, this chain-reacting algorithm will bootstrap human knowledge (kind of) in one step.
### Mel

Happy 2020.  Hope you got some good relaxation in over the holidays.

A frost scholar!  Well I am secretly relieved to hear it.  All I could think is WOW, I could never pull that insight out of one or ten readings of the poem!

As I read the poem with this framing, it seems to me the Frost is simultaenously saying that the path you take DOES change everything.  Yet paradoxically they lay equally before you today.  Meaning that at this moment there is no basis for choosing one over the other.

I am reminded of a crossroad where I precipitously needed to choose between two thesis advisors.  In discussion, one of them told me:  This choice will change literally everything about your career and your life, but you cannot really see any of that now...  so just choose, and then decide that whichever choice you made was the right one.

This entire concept was completely beyond me to execute at the time, or even now?  Indeed I really could not accept its truth; I stared bloodshot in the eyes as far as I could see into the mist, and then FRETTED.    I think I will ask him now if he was intentionally referenceing Frost, his message was so dead on!  ... and he is exactly that kind of guy.

... a Frost scholar as a mentor ...   cool...

### Kyle

Kyle is it possible?  My aim is a verifyable AWS lambda function (perhaps using locked S3 buckets).  I want to allow public verification that an endpoint is running what it claims it is.  Can I email my question in more detail?

ksomers@amazon.com

Kyle,
Thanks so much for letting me write to you!  I waited a bit just to let you have your vacation in peace.  I have read some of your materials online I think you are a good person to ask this question to, and I would also rather not shout my question out on the internet.  This relates to some IP that is not currently protected, so please pardon me if I am a little indirect in my questions.

MY GOAL:
Broadly I am trying to create a lambda end point:
	(1) whose behavior is somehow provably matched to some 
		published spec of its behavior over some defined time interval.
	(2) This verification step is achieved in a way that authorized 	third parties who explictly do not trust the creator of this 	 lambda can verify that its configuration is nonetheless    	precisely as published.


HERE ARE SOME PIECES THAT I THINK I AM ABLE TO USE:

- LOCKED S3 BUCKETS -- as I understand it, one can pay to create an S3 bucket whose contents neither you nor no one else can change, and it will exist with some specific contents for some pre-paid length of time.  Is this right?

- NO LAMBDA LOCK -- Unfortunately the current lambda APIs do not afford anyway to provably remove ones own ability to change the configuration of a lambda.  (i.e. there is an S3 content lock, but there is no equivelant lambda lock).  Correct?

- FULL SPEC TEXT FILE -- One can trivially create a text file that fully specifies all aspects of a lambda endpoint.  I think lambda already has a partial spec like this, but as I understand it, the layer contents and access permissions are not included.  Still one could create an extended form that was all inclusive.  Correct?

- FULL SPEC VALIDATION -- Given that one had such a full spec text file, one could programmatically query the AWS apis to verify that a specific lambda endpoint was configured precisely according to the full spec at that moment in time.

- GUARANTEED TRACABILITY -- In lieu of having a lambda lock, it does seem one is able to use lambda tracing/logging capability to verify that the configuration of a lambda endpoint was configured according to a specific spec, and that it had not been altered over some specific period in the past.  Correct?

- LOG TAMPERING -- Are the logs designed in a way that precludes the adminstrator of the account itself from altering them in a way that makes it look as if the configuration had not been changed even when it had been changed?


I think I may be pushing AWS lambda to a place where it was not really designed to go, still it tantalizingly close to the capabilities needed, so maybe it could be made to work anyway.

Thanks in advance for any help, and apologies if these questions seem to be coming from outer space!  

Thanks,
Dan



- each and every part of that spec was precisely 

- , and assuming one had permissions, one could I would like to fully and precisely specify the behavior of a lambda endpoint based entirely on contents in S3.
- LOCKED BEHAVIOR -- I would like to 
- a single master S3 bucket and several dependent buckets.




BACKGROUND:
- Etherium and other block chain technologies provide a turing complete "contract" language mechanism which has the virtue of the coorectness of its execution guaranteed by a global consensus mechanism.
- You can think of the execution of an etherium contract a bit like a lambda invocation, it is just A MILLION times less cost effective.  Maybe worse than 1M times more costly and slower too.
- But an Etherium contract is visible and guaranteed in a way that a lambda invocation is not.

GOAL:
- ON Build an "off chain" computation substrate using AWS lambda which "borrows" some of the block chain guarantees by being "launched" from a on-chain data.
## The Future #2

I find pieces like this quite frustrating. You assert: we don't have to chase "talent," we can have pay parity... and profits won't suffer. I promise!

I agree with your worries, but pretending that dynamics which CAUSE these problems are not there is pointless hand wringing. Like basecamp we hire rarified talent, and treat them well -- you have to if you are going to keep them!

But here is the reality check for you: the jobs (like basecamp) where one person's output will impact 1M+ other people are mathematically going to be rare. And these markets are winner(s) take most all. This is the nature of knowledge work. And with automation/robotics/AI the remaining physical work will continue to have less and less monetary value.

Knowledge work is an inherently unstable business. It reinvents itself at an astounding speed. Winners get more profit then grow faster, and win more. They grow to permanently dominate their area, until it is disrupted. The main areas for growth are new ones where no one has yet established dominance... and the race to gain that dominance in those areas is FIERCE. Only the luckiest, talent-est, hardest driving have a shot at that dominance, the rest will dwindle. This is the math of reality my friend, as much as you feel it morally should be different, it is not.

For me the more troubling trend is the reality that we have physical work which is loosing value, and knowledge work is tending towards greater concentration. (e.g. 1 human impacts more and more others). Thus the percentage of the population that are strong financial contributors drops.

Capitalism was just not built for this situation, and humans were not built to have no job.

But back to your article.  It is frustrating because it purports to aim at a solution and has not even identified the problem correctly (in my opinion).

--Dan



### The Future

The core problem that is killing / will kill the present economic system:

TALENT.  

MULTIPLIERS.  I define a multiplier as a person whose output noticeably benefits 1M+ other people in a way that they are willing to pay for over the course of a year.  For example a well known, or strong football player might affect their team to a degree to drive game sales for 1M+ people within a given year.

In the past multipliers were rare, and the fraction of the GDP paid to mulipliers was tiny, but several trends (aggregation, automationm, robotics and AI) are driving the to a point where multipliers will dominate and ultimately destroy the current economic system.

This analysis is a bit simplistic, but it gets to the root of the current shift:
Automation and aggregation are increasing the multiplication of the people remaining within certain industries.  At the turn of the last century a single farmer could only grow the food for several, now it is several hundred thousands, and the trend only accelerates.  Distribution and manufacturing are on similar trajectories.  The result is fewer people needed and outputs increased.

The second trend AI and Robotics replaces human labor with capital -- the capital needed to pay for the AI and robotics.  This also reduces the number of non-multiplier jobs available.  

The only counter trend to this is a craftsman or service trend where a premium is paid specifically for human labor itself.  Either because the human labor is in some way still superior to the automated alternative, or it is just the luxury of having another human wait upon you.

But the fraction of the GDP paid to the non-multiplier crowd will drop without limit as automation replaces humans as the most effective solution for most tasks.

This will yield a three tiered society: multipliers, servers/craftsman, and unemployables.

Now how do we run such a society?  The multipliers will easily make 100x more than servers do, and the unemployed make nothing?  The present system would leave one group dead, the next group desolate earning a few percent of the GDP, and the top group making all the money.

### Outcult email

Dan,

here a summary of the thinking from our prior call:

- SHOW IT -- The idea that we would use your experience to learn how to drive new buisness for AF is an exciting idea for us in principle, but the real excitement comes when we see that it can move from theory to effective action.  Here are our ideas about how we might do this in a way that is best for all parties:

- LEAD BY YOU -- I am happy to, and need to, give you feedback on your ongoing ideas, so that you don't waste your efforts on somethig that we would not bankroll.  That said, the specific written proposals would come from you, and they would be that basis for action.  we would all get on the same page, then AF would fund the effort, we would see what happened, and decide what to do next.

- MINIMIZE RISK -- As a general principle we would like to set this up in an iterative system that specifically is designed to minimize risk on all sides.  Here are a number of ideas that seem to do this:

- AF PAYS -- In the long run you stand to perhaps land your next gig as part of our team, that could be a big value, but it is too uncertain for you to be risking your money towards that end.  Instead AF will be risking it money, and in return AF should be getting good experimentation per dollar and per founder hours of out of the collaboration no matter what happens.
	Here are some ideas of maximizing value per dollar and per founder hour:

	- USE PHILLIPPINE TEAM -- We have guys that can put up websites, including some graphic designing etc. (if someone provides them the copy).  They can potentially answer emails etc. too, as long as the behavior is precisely specified (e.g. flow charts and templated emails, etc.)
	
	- USE AF DOLLARS FOR ADS -- As long as Nick and Dan are approving already fleshed out ad campaigns, then it seems safe enough to spend AF dollars to run specific experiments.  hopefully then can be iterative, so at each stage we are not approving many many thousands on a test.
	
	- REACTIVE FOUNDER FEEDBACK -- You are the expert on sales strategies, so we can save founder time by allowing you to first propose concrete plans of action, and then I give feedback on how comefortable we are with the path so you are not wasting time fleshing out a dead end.  This can put the ball in your court, while still ensuring that you have a solid feedback single to guide your work.  (we are not too risk averse, as long as our brand is not at risk, we are ok giving a try to a range of things.  The big litmus: first we want to see the concrete detailed plan...)

- PROPOSAL ITERATION -- To save everyones time, we imagine the following process execution:
	- Outcult & Oblinger brainstorm verbally.
	- Outcult proposes one or more "back of the napikin" plans.
	- Oblinger provides early feedback if we would likely fund one or more.
	- Outcult (maybe with spot help from Philippine team) fleshes out the details proposal.
		- It may be possible for Outcult to obtain modest help from the Philippine team for very well specified info searches 
			(not clear how helpful it would be, but it is there.)
		- Oblinger would be on hand to give feedback if there were questions of scope, costs, or strategy... but mostly we would be looking to Outcult for such ideas
	- Detailed proposal is on paper.  This would be all the way down to the actual copy that would be on the landing pages, and the actual copy to be used in the email outreach. etc.  Getting to this concrete proposal would be ALOT of work, but it would make the executing of the proposal much less work, since much of it was preloaded.
	- Once a specific campaign was "locked and loaded" it would be executed according to plan.
		- Quite possible large parts of the plan would be executed by the Phillippine team, at least if Outcult can design it in that way.

	- SMALL SIZING -- Rinse and repeat.  These proposal / execution phases would be iterated, in a way that breaks up the risk taken on my AF for each one of these campaign/experiments, and it also shrinks down the work require by Outcult to get ready for execution.
	
	- PAYMENT -- In addition to paying 100% of the costs for these experiments, AF would pay a nominal salary to Outcult.  
		- Our thinking is something like $1.5K/month for solid part time work.
		- We would select a nominal time frame for executing a proposal, and readying for the next proposal, and that nominal timeframe would imply a dollar figure (at $1.5K/mo).
		- Actual payment would occur as propsal was executed and next proposal was accepted.
		
	- PARALLIZATION -- As this model ramps up, we can easily have multiple project bundled into larger proposals.
	
	- OUTCULT VALUE -- The real value to Outcult is likely the idea that we might hit upon a working recipe, and we transition away from this model towards one where he is more of a partner within the company.  Until that point, this is somehting of a "heavy hobby" for him.  Earning a bit of money, and having interesting resources to play with, but not really "worth it" until we hit upon some kind of repeatable process that he is driving.

### selection bias in science

https://medium.com/p/fab3a09409ad/responses/show

My Context: not quite a believer in God, nor a non-believer either.


Ella, as usual your piece is well written, and conveys the Anthropomorphic concept well. As I consider the assertion in the text: ``that these coincidences *force* scientist toward the multiverse model'' it occurs to me:
Science can never really provide insight onto the question of the divine.
Science has an unshakable bias towards naturalist explanations - science itself has a strong selection bias. Thus its successes in finding naturalist explanations, and its failure to find evidence for anything else merely reflects the selection bias of science itself - this outcome is not necessarily a reflection on reality.
That said, I am not trying to bend this into some kind of God proof. What it is, is dramatic proof of the unshakability of the scientific bias (which of course has empirically served humanity quite well.)

### RACE
cannot find the main thread... adding this here
#### Human axioms of behavior
- IDENTITY IS RELATIONAL -- To strongly identify X as a Y is to also strong identify that X is not a NOT-Y.  Thus strongly binding ones identity to a group is to also strongly identify onself as SEPERATE from non-members of that group.  The more one feels the most important aspects come from a group identity, the less one feels connection to any not in that group.
- SYMMETRY IN STANCE -- 
- HUMANS HELP THEIR GROUP -- 
### Coin thoughts

coin thoughts:
(this will likely be rambling, hope you don't mind...)
this is not really about your business, which one way or another I am generally bullish on, but expect it will dramtically fail to execute in ways you expect.

this is more about crypto generally:


(TOPIC #1) tell me again about this guy who is going to tank BTC in a years time.  Is he claiming he ALREADY has all the parts of the key, or is he claiming that he *will* have those parts by then.  (the reason I care is that **IF** he is claiming he already has them, then i might be tempted to think about how to trade to leverage this situation... not sure)



(TOPIC #2) you gave an off the cuff argument that the ETH gas model is flawed relative to the BTC model where computation is proportionate to program size.

I thought about this...  and I don't see why this should be so.  I agree we need to charge enough per transaction that we can pay for the computation required by that transaction.  Still whether you unroll a loop into may BTC tranactions, or you roll it up into one ETH transaction with enough gas, either way you are paying for the compute you use.

So why does the ETH model not scale?



(3) It seems to me long term, that the things we hope a consensus protocol do for us are not even enumerated yet.  Thus there is essentially a zero percent chance that these protocol will stand the test of time.

BUT:

(3a) Just as the JS ecosystem is now unrecognizably different from what JS was when it was born, so the current coin protocols might evolve, in a continuous way w/o a break in continuity.  Maybe.  It will not be enough to simply implement fancy new things on top.  Many changes in speed and capability will require incompatible changes at the bottom.

BUT just as with the JS community, there was this installed browser base, so it was a non-starter to just build a new better standard.  The browser writers needed to agree to adopt breaking changes over time so the standard could move forward.  We was the BTC community *fail* to do this, but it is early days, and I think one currency or another will adopt some good governance model that will allow such progress more smoothly.


(3b) And even if we DONT see an actual continuously adapting protocol live into the future, it may not matter.  There might be ways that crypto assets abstract above the specific chain they reside upon.  this second idea relates to a couple of tenative predictions in the next section:



TENTATIVE PREDICTION #1 -- Transaction costs will drop to the cost of computing.  (e.g. very very low).  I know all the issues with non-proof of work systems, and I am not sure the ways around them.  Still it seems incredibly unlikely that there are not work around to either reduce per transaction costs for proof of work, or to strengthen non-proof of work.  thus giving us a huge boost to productivity.

TENTIATIVE PREDICTION #2 -- ICOs will mostly go away.  Not just the ICO itself, but even more, the idea that big money will be made in the growing of the currency stock for new coins.  I think investors and users will put up with a tiny amount of that as a percentage of the total assets invested, but nothing remotely like what has happened with BTC.  A HUGE percent of the NPV of BTC is in the hands of the miners and early investors that took a gamble.

In a way this is a ponzi scheme since it offers rewards that are not sustainable.  and later investors are carrying the weight of the largess bestowed upon earlier investors.  

Early on this made sense since the next bitcoin was not just around the corner, you should jump on and ride the one time capitalization.  But once the worlds coin-available-stores-of-wealth are already stored on chain somewhere, we are not in the same situation.

Only if someone one coin would magically be in a position relative to all others to be known to be destined to dominate could one really expect such a ponzi like growth to occur.  but what would one coin be better in the long run than another?  Seems others could adopt the same innovations.

If that is right.  No coin will be at dramatic, sustained advantage, then it cannot command a strong premium.  e.g. sell at a 20% discount since new buyers would be paying a tax to all those who already own the coin at a much lower cost.  If all new coins have similar chances in this future world, why choose one forcing me to only get 80cents on the dollar in value?


So this brings me to the prediction:

The only way to start a new currency is by "burning" coins on an existing chain.  that is locking those coins up in a practical way that allows for reversing BACK into that original currency.  I have some thoughts about how do to that, and there are papers on it too.

But anyway this suggests a social shift.  Now no new currency will be free to just print coins and expect money.  Rather they will shift coins from existing chains.

I predict either 3a or 3b will be how BTC ends.

Either it evolves or it dies.  But either way it seems the VALUE stored on the chain might live on.  

this is a critical prediction since #3 says it will be replaced, so don't invest but 3a & 3b together suggest you SHOULD invest.  (right now the fraction of the worlds wealth that wants to be stored safely is HUGE, it just does not yet trust crypto enough)




TENATIVE PREDICTION #3 -- before 2030 the world will dramatically shift to store long term assets on chain -- but unlike most today who make that same prediction, I don't think humans will trust such tech's long term sustainabililty within that time frame.  Instead I think they will trust the idea of the contuation of some kind of chain.

e.g. Even today if I poll many tech guys, most all say (1) chains are here to stay.  (2) most chains of today may/will die.

but once we start believing that the only way to create a NEW chain is to burn coins (or other assets) in exchange for those new coins on the new chain, NOW I can trust that my old chain coins will still retain value.  Indeed if the only way to get one OZ of gold's worth of new coin is to burn one OZ of gold's worth of old coin, then it seems this would keep the price of old chain's coins from collapsing too fast even as the writing on the wall became clear that it was not going to be a long time winner, you still need to coins to buy the new currency.

I am only mildly long in BTC now, but maybe I should change that.


~-~~
IDEA:   BRIDGE BOND CONTRACTS

I know there are theoretical secure ways to transfer coins between chains.  Nobody has implemented them yet.  Maybe they will work well.  Maybe they will be compatible with the flexibility offered by all of these smart contract types.  I cannot tell.

But I have a competing approach... I bet others have not considered, since it has a social element.  But basically it involved creating and destroying these bridge bond contracts.  It is only half worked out in my head... nothing on paper.  

But unlike the proposals I have heard about, this approach would work between ANY two chains w/o any specific dependency on the chain contract details since it would operate via a third protocol that is not on EITHER chain.

It would be fun to tell you about the 1/2 thought sometime....
If I am right about the need to shift chains, and it turns out the purely computational approach does not work well, it could be an important technology.

anyway, just fun stuff to think about!

Enjoy bangkok,

#### C Review

We did a 4-day trial with Carolina for a full time Nanny position.  It did not go that well, partly for reasons outside her control.  But we did learn some things of relevance for others.

MESSY.  In her own words, she is messy by nature.  She claims that she can organize and be clean professionally.  We found that messiness does show through in her execution.  Examples:   Each day as she cooked her liquids would boil over on the stove, and she did not clean them without explicit request (she said she was going to clean these the next moring).  I called some of her references who also said the needed to clean after her at times.  She left a soaking wet dirty cleaning towel under sink on top of toilet paper.  

ATTENTION TO DETAIL.  There were many small examples of just not  paying attention to details.  Not putting the cap tightly onto a water bottle before putting it into the stroller.  Forgetting things like keys and phone etc. frequently.  Leaving a room heater on in a room with all windows open.  Not setting her alarm clock so she wakes for work.  Leaving things out, leaving the stroller directly in front of the front door so it cannot open.

SAFETY.  One or two things seemed somewhat unsafe.  She returned with our baby and started putting him in his carrier onto an unstable surface -- I cried out before she let go, but it did not make me feel safe.  The main concern around safety stems from the attention to detail.  Her heart seems in the right place, but I worry that something bad could happen by accident.


INTEGRITY.  I gave her $100 to buy groceries.  Asked her to buy "soft scrub" to clean tub.  She bought a body scrub.  When she left she took it with her.  When I confronted about this she said this was a confusion.  Ok, but if this is a confusion, then why take it with you? 


We hired her for Nanny work, and for reason beyond her control she was not really able to do that work.  Still for all of the reasons above we became less comefortable to even let her try.
### AF Contract Tracking

**PROPOSAL REQUEST** -- We have agreement that AF should be write a proposal.  Immediate actions (<24 hours):
- **DATA GATHER SCHEDULED** -- If data gather meetings are needed they should be scheduled immediately upon proposal request.
- **TIMELINE SET** -- Immediately upon proposal request written timeline detailing owners and dates for proposal.
	(Timeline might only have two lines for PDD / SOW, or might 
	 include data gather steps etc.  Try writing in parallel.
	 Most proposals should be back to client in a week.)
 - **TIMELINE** -- At a minimum the timeline should include: 
	 1. DATA GATHER meeting times
	 2. PDD owner/dates, 
	 3. SOW owner/dates, 
	 4. Presentation meeting owner/date invitation is sent.

**PROPOSAL MEETING** -- Owner of this meeting also owns sheparding proposal upto acceptance.
- Generally want to keep pinging client twice weekly or so to keep proposal moving, and ensure there are no issues.

**ACCEPTANCE** -- Client has agreed to contract terms.
PM owns timeline now.  Immediate action (<24 hours):
- Timeline for contract ramp up is written.  
	(may be a single date, but it is written)
- Work begins

### THE TWO CHOICES (politics)

FELLOW DEMOCRATS, WAKE THE EFF UP !


Mathematics dictates that each party has exactly two choices:

(1) Craft a message that resonates with a winning majority of electorial seats.

(2) Whine and moan from the sidelines while others lead.



In 2016 the Democrats chose option #2 and Trump chose #1 -- that is not my opinion that is historical fact.  

As we head further left we dig deeper into #2 -- folks that's not my opinion -- that is simple math.

       *WAKE*  *THE*   *EFF*   *UP* !!!   



So what should we do?
1. Focus!  Only talk about issues that appeal broadly to all Americans.

Nick:

-- I have a big question mark around estee lauder.
   it was a weird meeting, I found little specific to propose,      but they are pretty behind internally, so it felt like they 
   need help.  Big problem is I cannot find my recording of this    interview, so I am really flying blind.  In theory we have a 	meeting scheduled (but it is only on my calendar right now).  	 We could push for an EIP discussion, but I think she is not      the right person to pitch it to.  Maybe the initial pitch...

Mr Tuscon Electric.

We did some work modelling earlier this year disaggregating power usage of individual devices in the home, based on very rough instrumentation at the fusebox.  And last year we worked with MICROSYNCOGUYS who have an extremely high resolution power monitoring sensor.  Depending on the data being collected it seem possible one could produce hyper-fine grained power usage models.  It would be interesting to estimate the costs savings that could be obtained if such modelling were used in planning and decision may co-founder to bring in an idea for your engineering team?

Subject: Value add analytics for your clients
~-~
Kerry,

It was great to connect at GDS.  I really did hope to connect with you more, but didn't get the chance to make it happen!

It’s clear that you have a deep understanding of the data that is available and useful to the prospecting and operations work that is at the heart of exploration. You have this real untapped potential around leveraging data given the direct relationship that you have with the ultimate buyer in each one of these engagements.

There MUST be real upsell potential in the data that you are collecting in each one of these engagements.  I don't see my way clear to the answer yet, but it pains me to see those dollars just laying on the table! 

Also, its clear that your org is lopsided.  Having dozens of geologists and ZERO data scientists on staff just cannot be optimal.  If you get to a spot where you have candidates for that role I would be happy to give you third party assessment of their data science credentials .

My November is pretty much spoken for, but if you have interest in thinking through some of these issues, I would enjoy a brainstorming call first week of december.

Let me know,
Dan

I am looking forward to the call you suggested with Keith.  It seems there are analytics that might be done on the supply chain itself, as well as optimization in sales and marketing.  (But if I recall Keith in only focused on supply chain.)

I am on an offsite all week with our team next week, but my schedule opens up starting on Nov 11th.  Is there any day that week which work for a followup call?

Scott, 

Great sitting next to you at GDS.  As I recall from the blur that was the last three days, you were going to check in with your manufacturing partner in Malaysia to see if they were ready to talk about data analytics.

If they are, we are more than happy to have the conversation.
In the mean time I have kept your on-prem cloud one pager.
It gives me enough to of hook to make an introduction if we find a client where this could be relevant.  (I have one in solar that I will run this past now.)

Looking forward to connecting again,

Subj: Finding the analytic value of your data
Daniel,

You guys are in an interesting position, you have gotten the political buy-in to build a large and expensive data lake, but have not had the chance to explore which parts of that data can really be used to drive bottom line value.  The good news is that the data lake money has not been spent yet, so you still have time to learn and direct your vendor towards the cleaning and organizing which is really going to have business impact.

If you recall our approach in these situations:  We like to bite off a small tactical outcome that seems it might have value, build a POC (on our nickel) to see if we can make a bottom line difference in that area.  You mentioned many juicy targets for us to consider.  Segmenting patients to drive drive marketing behavior, modelling differences in radiology consults by location, etc.

If you have an appetite for these kinds of POCs, our next step would be a call to enumerate your best guess on most important targets, that would let us come back with a few proposed approaches.  This really is the kind of homework that should be done before the data lake is complete -- else it will have the wrong shape!

Let me know if you have interest and time for a call to see nail down such a POC.

Cheers, 
Dan

Alan,
Glad that we connected at GDS, seems like this could be a worthwhile side relationship for both of us!  I have our followup call on the Calendar for Dec-3rd at 1pm EST, I will send a zoom meeting invite just so my co-founder can join too.

My thought is that we should just iron out a basic finder's fee, perhaps just a flat percent of all top line revenue generated in the first year or something like that.

It seems your background is pretty perfect for working closely with us, so if this connection is fruitful, there is alot we can do to put more fuel on that fire!  Also I know that your early aims are more about just providing raw data to these dealerships, but it is probably worth a bit the brainstorming to see if there are low hanging analytics that might really boost your value to the dealerships.  I am very happy to have a conversation or two just as a buddy about what might be possible.

Looking forward to the call,

Elizabeth,

Your exploratory mindset, your openness to trying things out quickly in the small, is a great value UPS and just fun to be around!  We have been thinking a bunch about how we might do an open pilot with your team.  It seems the biggest area for innovation is around the day-to-day real-time planning.  We had talked about connecting with one of your operational planners as a way to begin that exploration, but perhaps it makes most sense for us to talk again with you first?  

We have our annual offsite this week (whoo hoo, we are going to Prague), but after Nov 12th my schedule really opens up.  Is there a good day that week or the following for us to chat?

Looking forward,

I want to jump out of our workshop to meet the Cemex-Go team in Prague.  Not positive I should be spending the time.

Subj:  Getting the gold out of them thar hills

Steve,

Our conversation was really a highlight of the event for me.  Your situation is so unique and so perfect:  You have done the hardest work of just getting data into a unified framework, and have yet to embark significantly on the most fun part of doing the analytics to drive value.

I think the big challenge is going to be narrowing down onto a single area where we build our first POC.  As we mentioned, we like to try to narrow down to some tactical place where we can show concrete value using a basic POC.  *then* we put in a formal proposal for work.  

You said you would chat with several of your stakeholders about what value would matter most to them, and we would have a call in early december.  We should get that call scheduled so it doesn’t slip.  I am also thinking I should just jump on a plane and spend an afternoon having a couple of one-on-ones with a few of your stakeholders.  In a matter of one afternoon I think we could learn a TON about which POCs might be most practical, and most doable in a short timeframe.

Either way, can you do call a wednesday Dec-3rd call in the afternoon?

Cheers, 
Dan

Subj: Visit to Fresno

Munish,

Thanks for the chat at GDS, I learned alot in a few short minutes.  I am looking forward to our road trip to Fresno to see your team!  It seems there are so many different awesome directions to use analytics to provide concrete revenue improvements for OLAM.  I can tell we are at the very beginning of that understanding, so it probably makes sense for this trip to be a basic fact finding mission.  My thought is we arrange a series of short one-on-one conversations with different roles in the company, the aim would be to understand what tactical analysis could be done on your data in order to make the biggest improvement in their current job.  (Just as you did with the average weight optimization with cotton bales.)  On the heels of that we can probably do a little POC on our side before submitting any kind of formal proposal.  That way we have identified concrete value up front before sending anything up the line for approval.

What is a good week for us to go to Fresno?  We could do the second week in December, or skip to the first weeks in Jan as two possibilities.

Really looking forward!

Sundeep,

Our conversation about crazy strategies to model the high frequency trading market was a total blast at GDS...  Thanks for waking me up at the event.  Though you are tempting me to  *actaully* take the idea seriously!  Too many ideas, too little time!  I wanted to checkout your teaching videos, but I cannot recall now the name of the service that you use.  (something ...tutor?)

Would you like to put a call on the books for either the end of this month, or towards the middle of December?  I feel there has to be some good connections between the ML that I do and the way the industry works.  I also had **SO** much fun talking, I think I should not loose touch, just so I can occasionally have conversations like that in my life!

Bray,

It was great to connect at GDS.  I really did hope to connect with you more at GDS, but didn't get the chance to make it happen!

Its clear that you have a deep understanding of the data that is available and useful in the prospecting and operations work that is at the heart of exploration.

I was also thinking also thinking more about just how lopsided your companies current configuration is.  You have this real untapped potentential given the direct relationship that you have with the ultimate buyer in each one of these engagements.

I don't see my way clear to the answer yet, but there MUST be real upsell potential in the data that you are collecting in each one of these engagements.  It pains me to see those dollars just laying on the table!  Its also clear that your org is lopsided.  Having dozens of geologists and ZERO data scienists on staff just cannot be optimal.  If you get to a spot where you have candidates for that role I would be happy to give you third party assessemnt of their data science credentials .

My November is pretty much spoken for, but if you have interest in thinking through some of these issues, I would enjoy a brainstoming call first week of december.

Romeo,
Great to connect at GDS.  Great that I am meeting you right before my trip to Prague.  It will be sweet to meet the team there!  I am going to loop my team in to try and pick a time for me to meet the Cemex-Go team.  Also where specifically is the team located?  That will help me know how long it will take me to travel there and back.  

Looking forward to it!

JUST NICK
Nick,
I want to jump out of our workshop to meet the Cemex-Go team in Prague.  Not positive I should be spending the time.  Seems a long shot that we will really get business here, since they have an out sourcing team on the ground.  Still Romeo has offered, and I feel there are still ways we can bring them into other conversations.  not sure.  anyway, when should I jump out?  could be towards evening, but seems best to meet them at their offices, and meet many (if I am doing it at all.)

Thoughts,

Bobby,
It was great to hang out at GDS.  Things are going to be pretty crazy for me for much of Q4, but either during that time or top of the year I would love to dedicate a call to making sure I fully understand your product (I already have a pretty good understanding of costs/values), and also let you know the spots where we add value.  Are services are natural compliments, so it is good information to have.

Great to get to know you a bit too.

Sundeep,

Our conversation about crazy strategies to model the high frequency trading market was a total blast at GDS...  Thanks for waking me up at the event.  Though you are tempting me to  *actaully* take the idea a little seriously!  Too many ideas, too little time!

I wanted to checkout your teaching videos, but I cannot recall now the name of the service that you use.  (something ...tutor?)

Would you like to put a call on the books for either the end of this month, or towards the middle of December?  I feel there have got to be some good connections between the ML that I do and the way the industry works.  I also had **SO** much fun talking, I think I should not loose touch, just so I can occasionally have conversations like that in my life!  

Let me know if you have the time for that call, and if so, just pick a day and time in those weeks.

Cheers, 
Dan

# Update to mymgr

Some feedback:


My idea is we split the coordination work around things like conferences, events and such.
The benefit … if it works is that I am focused on activities that I cannot share with others, and am not spending time focused on the details of these things during the period leading up to them.
But I am very responsive so you are not struggling to understand with too little info.

To make it work it needs to be a background task that is done as soon as new info becomes available, that way we stay in sync, and it main calendar entry has the latest info.
To make it work, I need to be confident that if I am not paying attention, then in the last minute the details will have been considered.

The details are pretty standard:

— TICKETS BOUGHT?

— MEETING POINT LOCATIONS KNOWN?

— BACKUP CONTACT CELL NUMBER?

But I don’t know where I am going right now….  I will figure it out.  But anyway that is the aim of this way of splitting work ….  
I am not clear where my tickets are or where I go to pick them up….   It should be less than 1-2 hours total time to gather relevant info (I think, let me know if that is wrong)


Maybe it cannot work at AF, in this case I can just do it myself, or hire a separate person for this.
I don’t want to make a big deal out of this one function, but I also want to be clear in providing feedback:
   Right now it is not safe for me to ignore the details…. Stuff is going to drop…


So not a big deal, but also not working as it should.

Cheers, 
Dan
# Sleep question
-- 200K 3%

Nick, 
I am that guy.  reads all the sleep blogs, CBT class, eye-mask, ear-plugs, all the gadgets too.  My sleep is not terrible, but if I wake after 3-4 hours, oh god help me!  Even before I am fully conscious I am already thinking.  Many exciting projects in my world, and a few mild anxieties too.

I try put a boring topic front and center in my mind... with marginal success.  I try not to even go to pee as my chances of going back to sleep plummet.  After 30 min I am unlikely to make it back to sleep, so I get up.

Its tricky to take something to get back to sleep at that time.  Occasionally I will work for 2-3 hours, then fall back a sleep for 2 hours or so.  (essentially segmenting my night's sleep.)  If I do that early in the day, I will be sleepy again at night, but it is not time-efficient to have segmented sleep.

My sleep drive is plenty to GET to sleep.  but too weak to ensure I stay asleep and/or I just have too much going on so that waking up becomes a bigger issue.


How do I GET BACK TO SLEEP?

	Is this Home Depot?
38698:
	Thanks for messaging with The Home Depot. Message and data rates may apply. For more information text HELP, to opt-out text STOP. Privacy Policy and full Terms at https://corporate.homedepot.com/privacy-policy
Daniel Oblinger:
	I have a question about selecting the correct garage door spring.
38698:
	Hello! My name is Susan and I'll be assisting you today. With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?
Daniel Oblinger:
	This is Dan
38698:
	Hi there Dan! Did you have a specific question about selecting your garage door spring, or just need help figuring out which one you need?
Daniel Oblinger:
	I think I need to choose the correct torsion spring
	Mine has some grey or white spray paint on one end.
38698:
	https://www.homedepot.com/p/DURA-LIFT-0-218-in-Wire-x-2-in-D-x-26-in-L-Torsion-Springs-in-White-Left-and-Right-Wound-Pair-for-Sectional-Garage-Doors-DLTW226B/302333485
	Does that look correct?
Daniel Oblinger:
	Yes, but is that the only spring with that approximate color?
38698:
	Yes, white is it's own distinct color, so this would be what you'd need. The white indicates that it is a 110 pound spring. The next closest colors would be tan, yellow, or light blue, which are still all going to be fairly distinct from the white.
Daniel Oblinger:
	How heavy is the light blue one?  (Just to be sure that is not it)
	And what does it cost for delivery of the spring?  (Thx)
38698:
	Light blue is 190--it's actually the highest weight option.
	The link I sent is for the pair of springs, and it has free shipping!
Daniel Oblinger:
	Thanks, but I am confused.  The link you sent is for one that is rated at 188lbs.  That is almost exactly 190!
38698:
	If you'll allow me just a moment, I'm actually going to see about grabbing a supervisor, because my knowledge on these is limited, so I want to verify I'm giving you the best information. Please bear with me.
Daniel Oblinger:
	Sure!  Thanks!
38698:
	Thank you so much for your patience. I apologize, I was slightly off on what I was telling you, so I'm glad we checked. The color represents the wire gauge/thickness, which does directly impact weight, but is not the only factor we need to look at. 
White IS the color you have--I'm going to send you the official PDF from the Commercial & Residential Garage Door Division so you can see all of the colors--I'm still saying white is the only one close 😃
	However, that is not the only information that you need to base your choice on.
	https://www.dasma.com/PDF/Publications/TechDataSheets/CommercialResidential/TDS171.pdf (Colors on page 4)
	You also need to measure the inside diameter and length of your existing spring. I'm going to send you another link that shows you exactly how to do that.
Daniel Oblinger:
	Ok
38698:
	The other thing this link is going to talk about is the wind direction. We sell them in pairs, so you'll have one of each wind direction. You just need to make sure you are putting the correct spring on the correct side.
	https://idcspring.com/measure-order-torsion-springs/
	https://www.homedepot.com/s/white%2520garage%2520torsion%2520spring?NCNI-5
	This is a selection of different lengths, all in the 0.218 gauge (white) wire.
	You can purchase only one and replace one side, but just like with tires, you're going to get the best performance and balance by changing both sides at the same time.
Daniel Oblinger:
	Got it.  Ok thanks!
38698:
	Also, they did recommend, if you haven't changed torsion springs before, that you definitely look up a few tutorials on youtube to familiarize yourself with the process. It is a relatively simple process, but can be a bit tricky, and can also be dangerous if you don't exercise a few precautions.
Daniel Oblinger:
	Thanks!
	Does Home Depot partner with installation experts?
38698:
	We certainly do! You can go to this link to get more information on service for your area. https://www.homedepot.com/services/c/garage-door-opener-repair/ee5eda8e1?vfrom=search-results
Daniel Oblinger:
	Thanks so much for carefully answering my questions!   (This has been my best Home Depot interaction)

Jayant,
Sorry for dropping off the radar after our missed connection before your India trip.  I have a good excuse (see photo of my new son Eli below!)  

I get the sense that priorities might have shifted since we last spoke.  Still I would love to close the loop on the technology we developed identifying in home device usage.  We did some analysis of architectures for customer acquisition pipelines that we should show as well.

Let me know if there is a good day this week or next for us to catch up.

cheers,
Dan
### BRUCE -- H schien
Bruce:

It seems like the NLP chat bot, and war idea move the need on execution efficiency at Henry Schein while the auto-reston idea might really bup top line refenue.as well increase topline revenues.


It seemed in our calls we came to a couple of ideas that could potentially move the needle for Henry Schein.  

Its too early to know for sure, but applying AI to the chat-based workflow interface idea, the "war room" fleet optimization idea, and the vision-based auto-restocking vision idea all seemed strong. 

It seems the right next step if for you and I to have a call and get the bottom of it.  Either there is a "move the needle" actionable project here, or perhaps not.


If that sound right, let me know a few times we might talk,
dan
### Andre Email
Andre,

Glad to hear it.  We will keep that momentum up.
I am glad to have some direction regarding verticals.
We have experience specifically related to smart metering, so we will definitely be able to contribute in that area.

My only question about the vertical is the aim at utililty companies.  In one way they are a gold mine, since they have boat loads of revenue.  But in our experience they are extremely slow, risk-averse, and make decisons based on relationships instead of technology superiority.  So they are tough customers to get contracts with.  What is Josh's thinking on this?

Actually do you mind if I CC you on an email to Josh just to get his thinking about landing that segment of customer?
### James Note


~-~~-~

Nick here is my starter lists for team and for business model. I also included the direction I am giving James, just so you see where the deck is going....

Quick question: should I list NLP under AI.  really we have no one to cover this.  we can fake it a bit w. MIT, but it is definitely not their strength nor ours.  still it is a notable gap if I omit it.


~-~-~{[team summary]}

We are 60+ Senior Engineers and Data Scientists:

- AI researchers and engineers specialized in
	Image/Video * Deep Learning * NLP * ML * Statistics
	
- Infrastructure:
	data engineering * backend/cloud * embedded * devops & Yocto  
* Front End:
	Web (js, angular, react) * IOs / Androd * UX/design
	
- Dedicated QA team


~-~-~{[Engagement model points]}

- Teams are organized into "Pods" where each pod has: data science, engineering, PM leadership, and QA.

- We have project oriented engagements -- project typically start as fixed price/scope/time, then morph into an agile T&M structure. 

- Engagements typically have: explicit ending defined, internal team hiring/training support plans, and a final handoff built into them.  






~-~~-~~

James, 
I sent this to Nick and you at the same time, tomorrow he will work on this, so you can check in with him before you start, or you can just begin and then make his edits to both the old and new  versions.  (long term we will keep both portrait and landscape versions)

James, 
I want to create a slide deck based on our portrait pdf.
I know you are quite busy.... this is high priority and I will iterate with you as soon as you return this.  

But use your judgement if you cannot work on it immediately, I understand.

OVERALL DIRECTIONS
--> Slides are put into landscape
--> Maybe we use some kind of slide style or maybe it is just white
--> Here are the slides for the deck (derived from the portrait style deck)




FIRST SLIDE
- AF FLAME with "Analytics Fire" with it.
- Phrases on first slide:
		Boutique Consulting   	(as big text)
		specialized In			(as smaller text)
		Full Stack AI			(as big text)

SECOND SLIDE

Left side
- Picture of Dan, Dan's bio
- Picture of Nick, Nick's bio

Right side 
- Right approach, right tech, right experience
	(Use all the text from the left side of top portrait page.)


SLIDES 3, 4, 5
- These are the three use cases one per slide.


SLIDE SIX
Title:  Enabling Your Business Outcomes
SubTitleText:  (leveraging your data as it exists now)

   {[DIRECTIONS:
	- subtitle text in notably smaller font]}]
	- content for this slide is taken from the bottom half of the first portrait page from the first deck:
		"Leverage your data as it is ...."
	- Still have icons above and below 
	- Remove small text in lower section:  
		forecasting... sales..)
	- Change the icon for scheduling. rotate 90-degrees so schedule looks more like a gantt chart.  make bars thinner and show more structure there. (It needs to look like a gantt chart w/o the word scheduling below it.)
	- Change icon from manufacturing to have two or three internal nodes and a few more external nodes to the graph

SLIDE SEVEN
title:	The Analytics Fire Company

### two emails
Jayant,
Sorry I missed you on Friday.  Congrats on your promotion!  I am sure that is putting you underwater.  Once things settle down if you still have interest in the power disaggregation topic, it would be fun to show it to you.  But either way, it looks like you have good coverage for your current projects based on the team in India so it probably makes sense to first figure out what problems they can handle well, then if there are gaps to consider alteratives. 

Best luck in the new role!
--Dan

Legrand XXXX:

I recall from our conversation earlier this year that your team  was very interested in building intelligence into home/commercial understanding and control.  We just finished a POC where we explored the use of deep learning and marcov process learning in order to do power disaggregation.  That is to figure out which devices are being used within the home.  

What is interesting about this kind of work is that it can be done with a single sensor on the power grid, so it is the kind of thing that might complement your strategy as I understand it.  Very happy to show these results and hear your latest progress in adding intelligence.  

Let me know if you have interest in a call.
