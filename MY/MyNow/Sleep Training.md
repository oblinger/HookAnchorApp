### Basic Idea

We are teaching Eli how to put _HIMSELF_ to sleep.
We are trying to reassure him so he is not _FREAKED OUT_.


Thus
-- We are _NOT_ trying to HELP him go to sleep.
	==> It will not be there later; to get back to sleep
	==> any "sleep prop" we give only hurts him later.
-- We are trying to reassure him we are still there
-- We are settling him away from freak out mode.
	
- No bouncing (if you can help it) it is a sleep prop.



#### How To Do It (Net Moms)

KEY IDEAS:
- Use _key phrase_ each time to put down
- Use Shhhh/Pat
- Put your little one down the moment he stops crying,

How to do the 'pick up, put down' method

According to sleep training guidance from the NHS, these are the steps to follow for the pick up, put down technique...

1 If your baby cries when you first put him down, put your hand on his chest gently and reassure him with a 'Shhhh' or key phrase you always use like, ‘It's sleepy time'.

2 If that doesn't soothe him, pick him up and repeat the key phrase.

3 When he stops crying, but is still awake, put him back down in his cot. If he starts crying on the way down, put him in anyway.

4 If he is still crying, pick him up again. Repeat this process until you can see signs that your baby is settling (for example, his cries are getting weaker).

5 When you see this settling behaviour, don’t pick him up anymore. Leave him in his cot, place your hand on him and say your key phrase.

6 Leave the room.

7 If your baby starts crying again, repeat the process as many times as needed until he's asleep.
Pick up, put down: does it work?

The hope is your baby will eventually associate your key phrase or 'shhhh' with going to sleep. But every baby is different so don’t be disheartened if it doesn’t work for you. 
‘Pick up, put down' method: tips for success

According to the NHS, you should wait until your baby is six months before introducing any sleep training. 

Andrea suggests the following top tips for the ‘pick up, put down’ method:

    Always try and put your baby to bed when he’s drowsy but not asleep.
    Always start at the beginning of the night, rather than introducing the technique when your baby wakes up in the night.
    Have a calming bedtime routine and a consistent bedtime.
    Be patient: any sleep training technique can take a few weeks to work.

Pick up, put down technique at four-months-old

When your baby is four months, you can slightly adapt the steps as below:

    Only hold your baby for a maximum of five minutes. If he doesn't settle in that time, put him down and pick him up again if he is still upset.
    In between each pick up, put down, try and soothe him with a 'shush/ pat' in his cot.
    If the shush-pat doesn’t work, pick him up again.
    Put your little one down the moment he stops crying, starts to settle or once you have held him for a maximum of five minutes.

#### What about the Chair method?

- You can also mix PUPD with Chair
- The thing I like about this:
	= All that picking up and putting down is very stimulating.
	= Here we are reassuring so not freaked out, 
      but try to let him cry

#### What about E.A.S.Y. ?

Getting Started Correctly: Steps To Take Before You Begin PUPD Sleep Training

    E.A.S.Y Routine: In the book, Tracy says that in order for PUPD to be a success you must switch up the baby’s routine just a little and she follows something she coined as E.A.S.Y. E = Eat (feed baby) then comes A = Activity (baby gets to play), then comes S = Sleep and then Y = You (basically time for Yourself..). When I begun looking into PUPD, Zoe was on A.E.S.Y which I’m guessing is the case for lots of you guys too. I was concerned about making this change and feeding Zoe before play time because in my head I kept asking myself, “won’t she be hungry/thirsty after Activity”? Well, turns out, no. She doesn’t care much. It was so simple to do over 2 or 3 days and now that we have established E.A.S.Y., it makes a LOT of sense. So. That’s really the main thing. It’s helpful so that baby doesn’t have a sleep association like breastfeeding right before sleep etc.
