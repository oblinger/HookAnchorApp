Siblings:  Eli is our first  (unless you count our Boston Terrier...  we had been telling Grandma this is her grandson for the last 2 years)

HOW HEAR:
Friends of ours have their children at your center, they have given us many great details.

FAMILY:
Eli is a chunker.  He quickly grew from the 15 percentile to the 80th percentile before slowing down (phew!).  From his earliest days he was always a social boy, people's faces  are his favorite thing.  We are both professionals that love our jobs and are dedicated to growing in them.  Thus life has momentarily narrowed down to: Eli, work, grandma (living with us), the dog and a bit of church.  We are happy to keep it narrow for a bit, this is allowing us to enjoy each of these things w/o the stress of overload.

ACTIVITIES AT HOME:
Eli loves to switch it up: 
-- 50+ books from friends and everywhere
-- daily family walks.
-- We copied our friend's montissori-style setup at home: a padded pen with age appropriate toys and puzzles. 
-- Dad moved his office to the living room so this is now where all the action happens. 
-- Grandma lives with us, and we have all learned a bit of sign language to teach Eli (so far Eli has not learned any, but he watches!)

DOING INDEPENDENTLY:


US ENCOURAGING HIS INDEPENDENCE:


CONCENTRATION:
-- Early on, we had black and white cards that Eli would spend minutes staring at.  (we held them and taped them to poles and walls)
-- When we can tell he is trying to hit/reach/grab something we are very patient, giving him the time and space to struggle to do it.
-- Tummy time is often struggle-time for him.

Mostly we notice when he NATURALLY starts to focus on something, then try to not disturb his focus.  (He is already one determined little booger, he sets and aims for his own goals all the time! we try to interrupt once after he has lost interest or is getting too too frustrated.)


CURRENT CHILD CARE:
- Both parents are able to work multiple days per week from home.
- Both Grandmas have been able to live with us for about three months each.
- We are interviewing live-in Nannies now for the day when both Grandmas are gone.

WHY HERE:
- Even before we met, both of us had strong conviction that happy/healthy people are built from a strong internal core:  confidence, resilience, emotional and intellectual intelligence.  We both knew about montessori methods and wanted them for our children.

HOW CAN WE CONTRIBUTE:
- What would make the most difference?
        Dad's job as a Scientist is the most flexible, it would allow him to attend the day care on occasion if that is valuable.
- We assume you could not accept foods prepared for all the children, but if you could, that would be fun too.

HOW ARE YOU PREPARING FOR SEPARATION:
- We have been very attentive w. Eli early, but then gave him many monitored periods alone, and naturally there have been periods with multiple different care givers.  Both grandmas and several Nannies have had Eli alone for entire day at a time.  At the occasional gathering he already seems quite confident in the care of loving strangers.

SUCCESSFUL ADAPTATION:
- Eli is already flexible and curious in ways that make us feel the basics of this transition will not be too hard.
- We see Montessori school as a way to widen Eli's world and further his independence.  He doesn't currently play lots with other children, so we hope he grows in this way.  He is challenged by the sign language, reading, and playing we do at home.  Still we are both believers in professional training, we think his intelligence and emotional resilience will grow best with an enviornment like your added to his week.

WEANING PROCESS:
- Eli still drinks lots of mothers milk (both pumped and breastfeeding since mom is at work).  He is eating lots of pureed foods as a supplement to this.  By one year old he will be transitioned off of breastmilk during the day.

POTTY TRAINING:
- At six months Eli poops when he feels like pooping  :-)

SKIP
XX He takes short naps during the day, and pretty long sleep at night.  He can be a bit fussy when he is sleepy, but most of the time he is contented to be playing with things or just looking around at the things happening near him.  
XX Both mom and dad have jobs that let us work from home multiple days per week, and we have one grandma or the other living at our house, so Eli's early days have had lots of us around.

ACTIVITIES AT HOME:
Eli loves to switch it up:  
-- 50+ books from friends and everywhere
-- daily family walks. 
-- We copied our friend's montissori-style setup at home: a padded pen with age appropriate toys and puzzles.  
-- Dad moved his office to the living room so this is now where all the action happens.  
-- Grandma lives with us, and we have all learned a bit of sign language to teach Eli (so far Eli has not learned any!)
-- Eli LOVES his jumper:  he can stand, jump, and grab 1/2 dozen attached puzzles and toys we place there.  He plays for 1/2 hour at a time there.
-- Watching... he will stop what he is doing and just WATCH: cooking, typing, sweeping, moving.  He loves watching the dog, and the trees blowing in the harsh wind by our house will mesmerize him.

US ENCOURAGING HIS INDEPENDENCE:
-- Tummy time or sitting with toys in arms reach.  Often he will grunt in frustration as he tries to push or move.  We will give him a barefoot for traction, or maybe something to push on, but then we let him be frustrated as he struggles.
-- When he wakes and sleeps he often plays quietly in his crib -- we watch by monitor.
-- He fiercely wants to feed himself, so we allow that chaos to reign.  Note: his WANTS are really preceding his ABILITIES; we make up a bunch of puree, and at least a little does end up in his mouth :-)

HOW CAN WE CONTRIBUTE:
- What would make the most difference?
	Dad's job as a Scientist is most flexible, it would allow him to even attend the day care on occasion.  (His research once put him inside the preschool setting;  at least for that school having a male in the class was a bit rare, so it seemed to have an impact.)
