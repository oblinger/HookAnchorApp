### - [[SAVERS]] 
### - Bucketed Day
 (See [[Daily Schedules]])

Idea: Streamline day into 7 buckets shows below and strive to ensure progress made each day in key buckets: Main (+Chew, Coms) & EVE(Self, Out, Call, Learn, Q2)


2023-09
(see [[BKT]])

2023-04

Daily 7,  Sleep 7:

DAY:		  11	 6:30 - 5:30
- DAILY:	5	: Wake/First, : Eli, : Breakfast, 1 Lunch, : Nap, 1 Exercise, 1 Gap
- CHEW:	2	Todo
- PRIME:	4		

EVENING:  5:	6: - 11
- DAILY:	1 Eli
- FRIED:	2
- FUN:	2:


### - Daily Exercise
- RULE: Engage in 30 min of exercise each weekday and maybe weekends

EXECUTION:  
- Most days days to the treadmill
- If not then
- Pickup Eli by fast walking, if not then
- Do a 7-minute workout, if not then
- Do a vigorous walk after dinner


TYPES:
- Treadmill - 
- Pickup Eli - listen on way to Eli - Push self
- Nordic - 


### - A NEW DAY - RULESET

- BEGIN ANEW - Each day I begin anew, the successes and failings of the day before are past, THIS day, this one will be good.
- DAILY then WEEKLY reviews on most days.  Write a JNL entry with (1) gratitude, (2) what's working & not, (3) any updated plans, (4) occasionally retrospectives.
- ALARM - Set alarm, Cash card controls required waking.
- PLAN - Plan day (After Eli, or In Morning)
- WAKE - Waking activities:  Teeth,Dress,Clean  Meditate,Walk wack
- FAMILY - Break for family when need.  Immediate return.
- FOOD - 20min food break is ok, can read
- !!NO OTHER - No other shit!  Need to get down to work
- !!!30MIN - Target 30-min from wake to work
- !!!90MIN - Drop everything and begin work @ 90min after waking
- WORK - DayPlan and flagged items ONLY
- WORK MIN - Must do at least 30 min.  Ideally 3hrs with.  
- SHORT BREAKS - Frequently I take breaks.  set alarm each time:  Read, Chew
- CHEW - After doing work I switch to chew.

TRY:
- Allowing a work break for an extended chew.  with work expected after.
- Allow reading & email during breaks


### - MIT STACKS

==> 5min-intention-walk -> Login -> First song -> Begin MIT

==> 30min-Admin; Eat/Read 1hr -> MIT #2
	(can 'escape' MIT for admin; *MUST* do 30m MIT before eating)
==> Alarm -> Read In Bed -> Set morning alarm
	(set second alarm if not going to bed immediately)


IDEAS:
- BOOT  w/  WIFI OFF  & F1 fullscreen
- 
#### . FAILURE
- 2022-05-06
	- WAKING IDEA - Drawn off course by tempting idea thinking as I wake.
	- DRAWN BACK - As I started to work I kept getting pulled back to idea.
	- READ E-MAIL/NEWS - Read news first.
	- ON TRACK - Eventually took control.  4-hrs lost (including in bed)
	

### - MLC - MULTI LAYER CAKE

Idea: Manage level of work effort in defined layers

Details:
- MULTIPLE LAYERS OF TASKING
	- **Level 1:       MIT** -- _**Hardest to motivate**_, most important, requiring great focus
	- **Level 2:      CHEW** -- _**Repeated**_, easy, quick tasks, OR 
				**FLOW** Timely, easily motivated, impt, timely tasks
	- **Level 3:       FRIED** -- _**Not timely**_, easy/fun tasks, (maybe impt, focused, longer)
				**REST** -- Most _**rewarding**_, fun, recharging motivating activities
- TARGETS - Maintain target layering; try to hit targets each day

| Date       | TARGETS | NOTES                                                           |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2022-04-07 | 2/3/2   | Should be able to increase these, but lets crawl before walking |
| 2022-03-01 | 3/1/3   |                                                                 |


### - 7min Exercise
- Alarm is set for 4:30.  
- Stop & Exercise
- Go get Eli
- Shower when I return

FEATURES
- Need to push myself to be _uncomfortable_ during exercise


### - AD - Anchored Day

Idea: Define specific activities associated with three daily hooks

WAKING ANCHOR
- Dress: Bed/Teeth/Scale/Clothes, ?Meditate?
- Desk: Pills, Coffee, Apples
- MIT: 


EAT ANCHOR -- Immediately after lunch
- Plan post-lunch engage period & rest of day


EVENING ANCHOR -- Immediately after Eli is in bed.
- ++ Plan next day; add MIT *completion* plus ~2 other tasks to todo
- Scan emails
- Scan todo list


Waking Rules:
- <30min ready; 30+ MIT; Select Engage Time
- ++ Starts at Engage time.  Plan rest of work day.  Execute.

SUMMARY:
Lets give it a shot.  Many say having a schedule makes a big difference in the day, so lets try it.  The biggest idea is to simply have an alarm set


_

## = BEST HABITS
### - THE ENVELOPE - Brutally effective self accountability ---
#### THE METHOD

CURRENT DETAILS:
- ACTIVATION LOCATION: on night stand after meditation.  OFF = on floor
- SPACE CADET EXCEPTION -- you just forgot the rule.  BUT for this exception to apply as soon as you remember, you need to execute IN THAT MOMENT.
- WRONG CHOICE EXCEPTION -- anytime following the rule would clearly be very wrong or not the intent of the rule, then it is excluded.


SUMMARY:
- WRITTEN RULES -- summary on sticky note.  detail can be listed below here.
- LOCATION -- location of letter determines if the the rules are active or not
- EXCEPTIONS -- detailed list of exceptions or mods make trigger precise
- NEVER FLINCH -- *always* flush the cash on failure, then update the exception cases with an appropriately broad exception case for next time if needed.



KEY EMOTIONAL LESSON:  We are programming our brain to emotionally accept one simple fact.  Validity of the excuse is irrelevant.  If the rule is broken the cash with flush.  >>>PERIOD<<<. Yes this does mean someday you will consciously need to choose to flush the cash even when it was the correct choice to break the rules.  True.  But that cost is so so so much less than the cost of not following ones truest intentions.  But does highlight the need to list many exception cases a head of time, and it highlights the need to not choose a cash amount so big it cannot be flushed even in a case when breaking the rule was correct.


LETTER
I wrote this letter on DDD and promised I would give it away the day I failed a commitment to myself.  Well today I BLEW IT!  My loss is your gain!  Please use this cash to do something nice for others or yourself.  
Cheers!


STORY FORM
I have used this for years, it is a brutally effective way for you to become your own accountability partner.  It flipping WORKS!!!  But be careful it is easy to be too brutal on yourself!


Sometimes our impulses of the moment, and self excuses, override our true intentions.  This commitment device is nearly guaranteed to fix this mismatch between what you say you want in the cool light of day, and what you do in the heat of battle.  If you follow it, you will either change your mind about what you really want, or you will change your behavior...  if you follow it, there is no other option!  (Careful what you wish for, its BRUTAL!)




Here is a brutal but very effective commitment device:

-1- Put an amount of cash in an envelope that is personally noticeable, but also not so large that you couldn't afford to loose it a couple of time in a year.
-2- write a short note. My loss is your gain, use this cash for some kind of good, for someone (perhaps even yourself.) Seal the envelope.
-3- On a sticky note on the outside, or somewhere safe write down your commitment. e.g. I will exercise first thing on all weekdays unless I have a morning meeting. think hard to figure how to exclude all legitimate exception cases.
-4- Place the envelop in a specific visible place. that means it is active. (you can 'pause' it by putting it in a drawer the night before.)

Now any day that you fail to execute, you take the envelop and drop it outside somewhere. KEY: You really need to actually DO it. After dropping it once or twice it becomes a MASSIVE motivator. (but it is important to have a way to 'pause'.... e.g. you are very sick, or you were up all night.) I find that I rarely pause for dumb reasons, and it really does push oneself.

You can update the sticky note as your goals shift.

#### 2023-01-09 Wake-First-MIT

- TRIGGER - When first sitting down in front of the computer
	- RULE:  Triage day in first half hour.  
		- Generally triage email at same time, pushing social and medium stuff to in2, and bigger tasks onto todo
	- RULE:  Do at least 1/2 of productive work.   (Generally on a MIT tasks)
	- RULE:  During this time:  No reading medium, and no free cell.

ISSUE: Stress it causing me to fritter time, big chunks are lost at days start.  Partial fix is to get on track first thing.


#### 2022-01-27 - 30/30/30 - Morning Effiency & Focus on tough task
- HARD READY: after weekday meditation&bath set 30 min timer. 
		  then start MIT immediately after (within 30 minutes)
- HARD MIT: set 30 min timer & work in focused way; reset timer if distracted.
- OPTIONAL: (if hungry)   eat + read email&firefox for HARD 30 min before MIT
- SOFT: Work for 1.5-3hrs
- SOFT: After dinner: set MIT & tasks for next day, clear desk and eamils.
- SOFT: 7-min exercise in late afternoon & walk to pickup Eli too.
- MEDITATION EXCEPTION: if something thwarts meditation, then rules are soft.
- URGENCY EXCEPTION: No email/web before MIT unless I have reason to need to.
- HUNGER EXCEPTION: If hungrier than 2apples, do 30min eat & read.

#### 2022-01-27 - 30&30 - Morning Effiency & Focus on tough task
- HARD READY: after weekday meditation&bath set 30 min timer. 
		  then start MIT immediately after (within minutes)
- HARD MIT: set 30 min timer & work in focused way; reset timer if distracted.
- SOFT: Work for 1.5-3hrs.  7-min workout at end, then eat, then admin.
- SOFT: After dinner: set MIT & tasks for next day, clear desk and eamils.
- MEDITATION: if something thwarts meditation, then all rules are soft.
- URGENCY EXCEPTION: No email/web before MIT unless I have reason to need to.
- STARVING EXCEPTION: If hungrier than 2apples, do 30min eat & read.

### - PDP - Procrastination Defense Protocol

**HARD RULES**
- 30 min eat & email ???
- 30 min uninterrupted work


**RULES**
- **ALARM** -- Set alarm for 7 or 7:30 hours of sleep.  
	(can cancel/update anytime as needed)
- **ANCHOR** -- It is critical to execute the morning anchor each weekday.
	- **NO EMAIL** -- Don't read email or RSS until complete
	- **REAL 30 MIN** -- Don't count time that is not really executing well
	- **THOUGHTS** -- Can only transcribe thoughts into bullets into scratch
	- **EXCEPTIONS** -- Waking after 10; External interruption; scheduled task
- **PENALTY** -- Must drop cash card that day for ANY violation of anchor rules.



-1- Put an amount of cash in an envelope that is personally noticable, but also not so large that you couldn't afford to loose it a couple of time in a year.




-2- write a short note.  My loss is your gain, use this cash for some kind of good, for someone (perhaps even yourself.)  Seal the envelope.




-3- On a sticky note on the outside, or somewhere safe write down your commitment.  e.g. I will exercise first thing on all weekdays unless I have a morning meeting.  think hard to figure how to exclude all legitimate exception cases.




-4- Place the envelop in a specific visible place.  that means it is active.  (you can 'pause' it by putting it in a drawer the night before.)







Now any day that you fail to execute, you take the envelop and drop it outside somewhere.  KEY:  You really need to actually DO it.  After dropping it once or twice it becomes a MASSIVE motivator.  (but it is important to have a way to 'pause'.... e.g. you are very sick, or you were up all night.)  I find that I rarely pause for dumb reasons, and it really does push oneself.




You can update the sticky note as your goals shift.

### --- Path Visualization ---
-- Visualize correct actions:  Traction/Distraction
### --- The NOT todo list 

- Skip morning MIT
- Spend >30m eating  
_
### - HOOK HONING

Define:
- Hook name and letter prefix
- Rules for correct execution
- Metrics for success/failure/daily tracking

Idea:
Identify a hook, the rules, and metrics around the hook.

Idea: Have a set of strategies and triggers that best leverage my motivation and energy.

_
### - HOOK-HONING - Daily Triggers
Hooks:  W,M,L,A,F

**WAKE**:  	<5 resleep.  <30m get up.  >6 quickwake.  7 Alarm 
		W:  <1h up and <1.5h working
**MORN**:	Dig in for 2-3 hours
		M:  MIT >1.5h before 2p 
**LUNCH**:	After Lunch:  Sales30   Grid/Log/Chew
		L:  Lunch <1h.  Sales >10m.  ChewFirst
**AFTER**:	<1h  Re-engage:  2-3hr Block2&3 Task
		A:  Plan-and-do.  >1.5hr
**FRIED**:	Decide.  BeFocused.  Fried/UF/Read/Fam/Browse.
		F:  Make good use of fried time, however its done.
		
_
### - HDA - high density action

Key idea: Do M/S/C and Recharge

Rapid Recharger -- Nap, ?browse?, Exercise

MUST	--  Do or die tasks
SHOULD	--	Avoidance prone, important tasks
COULD	--	Phillic, valuable tasks
WILL	--  Automatic background tasks, that I will do w/o issue
REST	--	
QUIT    --  

_
### - SALES FIRST

APPROACH
- FIRST -- Create a section called "first" in my todo.
- AT START -- Attack items in this section "first" even before chew first. At least 30min spent. 
- ???? -- regular times to do sales planning?

Background:
- I hate the tracking of sales.  hate it.
- But I am not being insta-responsive in a way that I must.
_
### === OLDER STUFF ===
### EFFICIENT DAY -- 2019-10-15 - thinking about WHY -- 

RULES
- BED -- In bed by 11:00p -- maybe reading a bit
- ALARM -- 7am -- 


Recursive Problem Statement
- I want to have an unbreakable and efficient rhythm.  Why?
- I feel good when productive & want to accomplish before death.  
- Is exiliarating to do.  feel bad when day acheives little.
	ego is tied to it.  my contribution.
### Quick Healthy
- WALK ON ANY CALL OR THINKING
- G-MA FOODS - No eating at night
- 5-min workout each day?  (4 day/wk)
### BIG ROCKS
Related to two chunks.
Idea: Need to move the needle on the big chunks.  Rest will take care of itself.

Right Now There are Two:
- SALES PLAN
- UF TODO
### TWO CHUNKS
Idea: Try to get two 2-3 hr chunks of focused work done each day.
- ideal is to work continuous for 2-3 hours.  but still counts if total is >=3 hrs
- ideal is one of my defined projects, but can be any work (even running errands)
- The expectation is that each day will also have other things taking time away from these.

~ Must start after initial planning/email <1.5 hours.
~ If day starts in flow then MIT <6hours.
### FIRST THINGS
ASANA
-- Click Thru Asana tabs skipping Todo
-- Glance at HABITS
-- Finsh on Todos and figure out MIT & goals for the day
EMAIL
-- Triage email

Background:
-- Aim to trigger impt activities in a seamless flow chain that begins each day
-- Daily Check-in
	* Just look at MIT & work on for 2 min each day
	* Look at habits list daily too

### --- HIGH DENSITY ACTION

**GOAL:**  Spend my time (1) effectively and (2) in right areas

**ISSUE:**  Sometimes I cant force myself to make effective progress.
- At certain times certain tasks seem DRAMATICALLY harder for me to force myself to make progress on.
- Even when I managed to force myself to stay on task, I often don't make good progress.

**EFFECTIVENESS MEASURE  ==  task_importance  *  %task_effectiveness**
- The idea here is that we measure effeciveness as a combination of working on the right task, and our effectiveness on that task relative to some mytical 100% effectiveness rate.
- 100% effective means the speed and quality that Dan would achieve on his best day in the best mind, etc.

**IDEA:**
- SWITCH -- when I am not making good progress, I am very aware of it.  So just SWITCH!  Allow myself to freely swap off towards any high-ish priority task for as long as I want.
- SWITCH BACKS -- if I find that a high priority activity is languishing, keep restarting that activity, and keep allowing myself to switch away.
- LOOKING FOR THE CATCH -- I notice that once an task "catches" for me, I tend to hyper-focus, so I am just giving myself many opportunities to 'catch' and hyper focus on each high priority activity naturally without force.
- BACK STOPPING -- but this process could result in endless slipping on important but distastful tasks.   To avoid this we need to tracking when important task need to be tackled, and be sure we are eventaully disabling the "switch away" option until they are done.

**MAKING IT WORK:**
- ACCURATE TASK QUEUES -- Need to maintain task queues with accurate realtive prioritization and accurate due dates.
- HOT SWAP COINTEXT -- While tasks are in the "hot swap" list the context for action on those tasks need to be current and at "top of note"
	- Each 'hot swap' activity should be indexed by a spotlight_commander term.
	- The target of that term should be a Folding Text page.
	- That FT page should open to a section where this hot-tasks status is shown
	- Status info -- first line:
		summary of current goal
- PRIORITIZATION -- [msc]
	Prioritization of tasks should be organized according to consequences of action (or non-action).  One can should also order tasks within each category according to priority.  But these categories are important water marks since they indicate different stances toward a task:
	- MUST -- Tasks that 'must' be done otherwise there are unacceptable consequences.  Typically tasks don't get bumped up into the 'must' cateogory until they become critical.  e.g. a task that "must" be done, but could get done next week, does not count as a MUST task.  It only gets elevanted to must when further delay is unacceptable.
		The idea is to keep this category very very empty, so when something *IS* in this category and I am not doing it.  It is a screaming red alert -- no hiding that I am SCREWING UP ROYALLY.  It should never be normal to have things in the must category, and I am doing a non-'must' task.
	- SHOULD -- Tasks that are often pushed aside end up in this category.  they need to be push above others so they get attention.  They are things you "should" do before they become tasks you "must" do.
	- COULD -- Tasks that I "could" do at most any time and it would be a good thing to do generally.  These include the daily tasks like reading email, or showering.  They are not in the "SHOULD" category since no special pressure is needed.  This system is designed with the idea that there is time to accomplish all the "could tasks" and one naturally will do them all.  So category is not really involved in the pressure dynamics, these are just in the background. 
	- MIGHT -- Tasks that are important but are also kinda fun and so they can eclipse more pressing action.  These tasks are often the things I do when I "should" or "must" be doing something else.  These tasks are important, and they do deserve my time.  But they can sometimes be done so much that I starve out more important or more time critical tasks. 
	- SHOULDN'T -- These are tasks that have value or enjoyment.  Still given the finite nature of life, these are ones that I have decided I want to minimize.
	- MUSTN't -- These are activities that are toxic enough and with so little redeeming value, that I have decided I would be better off NEVER doing them.  (of course the spirit is willing while the body is weak, so we have them listed and tracked.)
	
- FLAGGING -- A way to measure and coax good behavior is to assess fractions of time spent in the wrong category.  Here are the measure of performance:
	- EFFECTIVENESS [0 - 100%] -- This is an overall "gut" assessement of how well you were doing what you were trying to do, compared with the quality and velocity relative to your "perfect day".  So 50% would mean taking 2 hours to do a 1 hour task, but achieving the same quality.  Difficult formalize how to penalize for drops in quality.  Really depends on the importance of the quality relative to outcome.
	- MEASURING EXECUTION FAILURES -- measured by day, and are measure in both in hours and in number of items. There are four flag types:
		- MUST-RATIO --  Your GET-ER-DONE ratio
			Number and mount of "must do" items that were completed in time.  not worked on enough to complete within allotted time.  Time measurement is amount of additional time that would have been required, which was spent on non-must tasks.  The cards are down, all your chances to get this done in advance are gone.  It is clutch "do or fail time".  The target here is 100% m
		- MUSTN'T-RATIO -- Your BACKBONE ratio.
			Number and amount of "mustn't do" activities done.
			You just said you were never gonna do that again, but there you did it again.  Yo!  Grow a spin
		- SHOULD-RATIO -- The BACKBONE ratio
				Ratio: must+should / all_except_could
				This is a measure of how well I am allocating my discretionary time.  Notice we have remove the "could" category.  No credit or penalty is assessed if you have a day with many doctor's appointments or emails to do.  you only get a low score if you should have been doing that sales deck but instead you put all your time into your side project.  Notice the goal is not 100%.  For me I would be happy with even a 40% level since it force strong motion on tasks I "should" be doing.
		- COULD-RATIO -- The ADMIN raio
