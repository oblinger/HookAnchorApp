### - THE ENVELOPE - Brutally effective self-accountability

#### THE METHOD GENERIC DETAILS

CURRENT DETAILS:
- ACTIVATION LOCATION: on night stand after meditation.  OFF = on floor
- SPACE CADET EXCEPTION -- you just forgot the rule.  BUT for this exception to apply as soon as you remember, you need to execute IN THAT MOMENT.
- WRONG CHOICE EXCEPTION -- anytime following the rule would clearly be very wrong or not the intent of the rule, then it is excluded.


SUMMARY:
- WRITTEN RULES -- summary on sticky note.  detail can be listed below here.
- LOCATION -- location of letter determines if the the rules are active or not
- EXCEPTIONS -- detailed list of exceptions or mods make trigger precise
- NEVER FLINCH -- *always* flush the cash on failure, then update the exception cases with an appropriately broad exception case for next time if needed.



KEY EMOTIONAL LESSON:  We are programming our brain to emotionally accept one simple fact.  Validity of the excuse is irrelevant.  If the rule is broken the cash with flush.  >>>PERIOD<<<. Yes this does mean someday you will consciously need to choose to flush the cash even when it was the correct choice to break the rules.  True.  But that cost is so so so much less than the cost of not following ones truest intentions.  But does highlight the need to list many exception cases a head of time, and it highlights the need to not choose a cash amount so big it cannot be flushed even in a case when breaking the rule was correct.


LETTER
I wrote this letter on DDD and promised I would give it away the day I failed a commitment to myself.  Well today I BLEW IT!  My loss is your gain!  Please use this cash to do something nice for others or yourself.  
Cheers!


STORY FORM
I have used this for years, it is a brutally effective way for you to become your own accountability partner.  It flipping WORKS!!!  But be careful it is easy to be too brutal on yourself!


Sometimes our impulses of the moment, and self excuses, override our true intentions.  This commitment device is nearly guaranteed to fix this mismatch between what you say you want in the cool light of day, and what you do in the heat of battle.  If you follow it, you will either change your mind about what you really want, or you will change your behavior...  if you follow it, there is no other option!  (Careful what you wish for, its BRUTAL!)




Here is a brutal but very effective commitment device:

-1- Put an amount of cash in an envelope that is personally noticeable, but also not so large that you couldn't afford to loose it a couple of time in a year.
-2- write a short note. My loss is your gain, use this cash for some kind of good, for someone (perhaps even yourself.) Seal the envelope.
-3- On a sticky note on the outside, or somewhere safe write down your commitment. e.g. I will exercise first thing on all weekdays unless I have a morning meeting. think hard to figure how to exclude all legitimate exception cases.
-4- Place the envelop in a specific visible place. that means it is active. (you can 'pause' it by putting it in a drawer the night before.)

Now any day that you fail to execute, you take the envelop and drop it outside somewhere. KEY: You really need to actually DO it. After dropping it once or twice it becomes a MASSIVE motivator. (but it is important to have a way to 'pause'.... e.g. you are very sick, or you were up all night.) I find that I rarely pause for dumb reasons, and it really does push oneself.

You can update the sticky note as your goals shift.
