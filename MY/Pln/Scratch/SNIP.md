### 2023-10-03  Science vs Engineering


SCIENCE VS ENGINEERING
Still inside our team we are doing science experiments and engineering.  Engineering is the kind of thing that we can plan for and depend upon in the short and the medium time frames.  Science experiments are often built out of engineering, so one can have an idea about how long each experiment will take.  But really only has probabilistic assurances over the longer term on the OUTCOME of those experiments.

Player ID seems to be the hardest part of Basketball stats, and Basketball seems to be harder than other sports in this hardest area, and Halos crucially depends upon this key thing.  So not only is this a science experiment, but it is one of our most difficult science experiments.  So we can and should get timelines for delivery of the next bit of engineering in delivering Halos, but that is not going to really give you what you want.  You want a timeline until halos are valuable for reducing our costs.  That timeline you mostly wont get when it depends upon science experiment.

The first answer you can get is timeline for the next engineering steps.
The second answer you can get is a progression over time of how we are doing, and how far we have to go (in percents, not in weeks)
The third answer you can get is a breakdown of the parts of the task, and estimates of how important and how well and how difficult each of those parts are.

What we can do is learn where our algorithms are falling down, and then estimate how hard each science experiment will be in fixing each of these areas.  That can give a good sense of how far away we are, and how fast we are moving.
### 2023-07-26  Piano

  
I just got QL’s piano out from the basement because I remembered how much Eli loved to jump on it as a kid.

  

And he started banging on it, and this time he was telling us about thunderstorms and people running and all kinds of stories to go with it.

The managed to drag a full glass of water off a table right into the keyboard after the first 2 hours of it being out.

  

Yeah after nearly no usage for the last 15 years besides Eli’s stomping as a baby, it bit the dust after 2 hours.

  

So I was thinking you guys might go in together on a new one.  I was doing some research on the best one…. Perhaps splitting something like $200-$250.  I am very happy to go in on it with you guys too.



### 2023-06-15  Noom Diet summary


I am a fan of the Noom diet, and I have done many ;-)
The diet is strongly focusing you on calorie density rather than macro nutrients (like low carb or such).  It fits into a realistic lifestyle since all foods are allowed it just biases towards "green" foods and less "red" foods.  It does require you to track your eating in the app AT EVERY MEAL.  they have entries for many many restaurants and grocery foods, so it is pretty easy.  Tracking my food really helped me eat the right amounts to loose weight and not get hungry.  The Red/Yellow/Green system helped me shift the foods I eat over time.  And the little "psychology" audio clips each day game me good tips and were worth the time.  I tracked my food daily for over 6 months, and now I just listed to their daily tips.  Occasionally I use the app to check the calorie density of a new food, but mostly I know which foods are which.  (Note: calorie density will steer you differently than many other diets.  For example chicken breast is ok, as a yellow food, but not is large amounts, sweet potatoes as a green food can be eaten in larger portions.). I would additionally focus on protein content of food, and fiber content of food, which noom talks about, but does not focus on.  Still overall I think noom helps you eat in a way that keeps you from feeling (as) hungry as you loose weight.  best luck! -dan

### 2022-04-07  UF - math vs code
Observation:  

When one makes a mathematical contribution (a new theorem or defintion) one uses terms that are "universal"
-- The term have consistent usage across all mathmatics:
- Its meaning is precise and consistent across all of mathematics, and 
- there are few alternate formulations of the same or nearly same idea

When one makes a computer science contribution (write code) one uses terms that are NOT universal.
-- The terms do not have consistent usage across all of computer science
- their meanings are not conserved
- there are many alternate formulation of the same or nearly the same idea.

One cannot combine knowlege based on incompatible terms.  Thus math knowlege (theorems) are combinable while computer science knowlege (code) is not.

The result is that mathematics is cumulative in a way that computer science is not.  For example (math example & CS example)

Could one formulate 



 a meaning which is consistently used across all of mathematics


you "say" something in mathematics (e.g. write down a theorem) you use terms

### 2021-00-00  Fox news egregious
For those interested in seeing the details regarding this pretty egregious case you can see the original video from Fox News on the wayback machine here:

https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20220206_020000_Unfiltered_With_Dan_Bongino/start/1740/end/1800

Evidently, Fox edited this clip mere hours later when the error was pointed out.  And Dan Bongino acknowleged the error in a subseqent show on air.  Still he claimed that the error did not affect or related to the content of his message.  Pretty silly since it directly contradicted it.

Here is the corresponding WalletHub article listing the HEALTIEST cities:
https://web.archive.org/web/20220208164109/https://wallethub.com/edu/healthiest-cities/31072


This definitely does show Dan on Fox as not caring what the facts really are, he want to show Democrats are bad.  Indeed it shows he is very willing to ignore dramatically contrary evidence in order to make this case.




### 2022-04-07  QL brag sheet
==>  Waymo reduced maint turn around by 23% in 2021.  In support of it:
- Created metric this turn around was based upon
- Designed and implemented comprehensive dashbord for analyzing maint delays.
	(this was the primary information soruce used by team to affect this turn around)
- Worked directly with data to identify 5-6 specific recommendations presented to and adopted by the team to reduce turn around.


exclusively used in order for the team to idenfify the changes needed for the turn around

### EXPLANATIONS

HERE IS HOW TO USE THE SNIP FILE
- HEAD -- Each snip begins with '###' and an optional title characters.
- ACTION -- Each snip is added here first, but then copied to a location for storage or subsequent editing.
- NEVER DELETED -- When the file gets long it is moved to archive, but this log of snips is never deleted, just duplicated to other places.
- The SNIP's body extends to the next '###' prefix.
- The '.' indicates that a note has been processed, or determined to not need processing.  W/O this mark it is possible, a snip should still be copied somewhere.
-
