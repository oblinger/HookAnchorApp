## Ideas


- Picnic at. Lands End: Pa. k a gourmet. picnic. and head to Lands End, a rugged coastal park with stunning views. Enjoy your meal while watching the waves crash against the cliffs.  San Francisco has a lot of great outdoors activities. One less well-known idea is taking a walk around Land's End.

- 1. Take a romantic walk along the Embarcadero waterfront and enjoy the views of the Bay Bridge and the city skyline.

On a clear and somewhat warm evening, walk up the Greenwich or Filbert stairs to Coit Tower, order a pizza from some place in North Beach willing to deliver to the parking lot (or bring a picnic), and watch the sunset!


- 1. Visit the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, which is a beautiful museum with stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge.

- 1. Visit the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and see some of the world's most famous modern art.
