Game Night
GUYS NIGHT OUT
- John 
- Anket
- Barry
- Justin





  At your place:
  - Backyard firepit (if you have one or get a cheap one) - guys + fire + drinks is basically a complete evening
  - Grill out back - you do burgers/dogs, tell people to bring beer and a side
  - Basement hangout - unfinished basement is actually perfect for a low-key vibe, throw down some chairs, set up a folding table for cards or drinks

  Use the walkable bars:
  - Start at yours, migrate to a bar - pre-game with some drinks and snacks, then walk to a dive bar with a pool table or darts
  - Bar crawl lite - hit 2-3 spots in walking distance, no plan, just wander

  Hybrid:
  - Grill at yours early evening → walk to a bar when the food's done → end up back at your place if people want to keep going

  SF-specific:
  - If any of those bars have a back patio, shuffleboard, or pool table, that becomes the anchor
  - Check if there's a bocce court nearby - very SF, very low-key

  Honestly for a first guys night, "I'm grilling, bring beer, we'll probably walk to [bar name] later" is the perfect amount of structure. What bars are in your walking radius - dives, sports bars, anything with games?
