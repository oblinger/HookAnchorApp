- [ ] - CIIA resolve issues.
- Get for 409A done.  
- Loan document (term sheet for the loan in the offer letter)  <-- typically done from Jason side.
- Agreement that share price is 409A price.


- You want a CIIA that makes diligence easy & safe for investors:
	- The CIIA should not making claims that are illegal according to state law, doing this could piss off a judge and put ones IP at risk.
	- The CIIA should not be governed by NH law.  Council for our new investors are unlikely to be familiar with various pitfalls and details of NH law, thus they will need to do additional diligent to have full confidence in the agreement.
	- The CIIA should be a standard CIIA that investors have seen hundreds of times before.  This allows them have confidence by default w/ little effort.
	  (here is a quote from my lawyer:  "I have seen thousands of CIIAs and I have never seen this one, or one from NH")

Sports Visio need an investor-friendly CIIA strategy.  
- One that is governed by state law most familiar to their coucil.  (e. g. Deleware state law)
- It should be a single uniform stategy (ideally with a single) core document that nonetheless correctly accounts for regional differences in IP law
- It should be a CIIA that is dominant across a large number of startups so it has been seen many times before by their council.




- Buying shares at 409A price and make an executive loan.  
- Sign offer letter & CIIA at same time.
- Wait 409A to come in.
- Buy the equity & sign the SIP at same time

- My lawyers fears you stock plan is crap.

- why don't you have a 409A?
- Consistent set of CIIA is very critical in diligence
- A judge can declare the contract to be crap 
- You want to be easy in diligence.  
- obvious you use a standard 
-  don't want
- Looked at thousands of CIIA and it is the first one you
	- Govered by NH law... not by deleware?!?!?


- Used by Clerky Tried and true CIIA beneficial 
	- we dont even ahve a NH laywer so how do we know it is 


- Disclose & Exclude orrick

- Loan

UPDATE: I originally challenged Erik's "overselling" this tech, but it was mostly my sloppy/quick reading. This is indeed an interesting and promising niche transport technology. Thanks Erik!

when you say "wouldn't it be great if we could free up the crowded space at these ocean ports" you are implicitly presenting this as a potential replacement for ocean going freight.

I think you know better? This tech will always be MUCH more expensive per ton than ocean going transport. I feel this piece is uninformed or is intentionally misleading.

(or I have an incorrect understanding of the true costs of things)

please clarify.

Steve, I went all in on your substack, well because I have a dream for your future...  which of course is completely unfair...  it is YOUR future, not mine, the dilettante on the side.  Still I feel the human greatness comes from being the right person randomly in the right context.  At its best your thinking and writing are inspiring and crystalizing.  And I think your message could be one that unifies and foments ACTION.  But I am not sure as an influencer it will have that effect.  In anycase, I am still a fan, and will still watch from the sidelines.

Royal Automotive Review:

aaaa
General conclusion:  Not good value for the money.

Detailed example:  I knocked the roof fin off my Audi and ask Royal to fix it.  For $650 they gave me a replacement part and painted it.  This seems a reasonable amount.

Then the wanted $2000 to install it.  this is because they insisted to push out a VERY minor depression on the room.  (barely visible)  I said I would like them to install it in a way that is sealed, but I don't need perfect body work as long as it is sealed.  (Honestly even if they did nothing except install the new part I am not certain if you could even see the depression)  They refused to say that pushing the roof out and repainting the roof was needed to seal the roof (since I don't think it IS required), and they refused to simply install it.

I took it to DAS auto and they installed it for $300, and told me it was sealed just fine.  Further when I look at the result on the car, it looks just fine.  If I get my head level with the top of the car and stare right at the front of the fin, I CAN see a tiny bit of a bubble there.  If I did not know what I was looking for, I would never have detected anything.

So Royal was absolutely unwilling to follow my request for an installation that sealed the car.  If you will always pay to keep your car immaculate as if it just left the showroom floor, then this limitation might not matter to you.  But for me I want the ability to decide, and I want a mechanic who will give me the straight scoop on the situation.  In that case Royal Automotive is just not the place for you.

DAS was great, but I get the sense that there are several very highly rated german auto specialists around...  Just pick DAS or one of these others!


These guys are organized around extracting your money.  I bought a late model A4 and paid $10K for four years of protection and service.  It was a poor choice on my part, and not worth it.  Still these guys are typical dealers in that regard.
