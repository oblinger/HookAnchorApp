BIO

In the decade and a half that I have known Jason, we have actively looked for ways to join forces, and I am excited to see that this is finally happening.  Advances in Computer Vision have spurred a cambrian explosion of computer vision based-startup, now is the time these new companies will cement their positions in these new markets, so I was looking for an opportunity just like this to be part of that revolution.

I have a PhD in Machine Learning from UIUC and have used that background as an individual researcher at IBM's Watson Lab and Teaching at Columbia University, publishing dozens of papers and hold almost 30 patents. Expanding on my IC work, I joined DARPA (along side Jason) and funded over $200M in R&D focusing on Machine Learning as applied to Vision and Natural Language Processing. One of my DARPA programs of note was "Machine Reading." in which IBM developed their  Watson Jeopardy playing system.   that unified knowledge across tens of thousands of books to best humanity in answering Jeopardy questions. After DARPA I moved to silicon valley where I have started and exited three companies, a specialized payments platform, a robotics company building a general purpose in home dexterous robot, and an AI-based clean tech company. In the past I have built 50+ person engineering teams, including a team of 40+ PhDs that spanned the globe.  I can't wait to dig in and make myself useful here at Sports Visio!
