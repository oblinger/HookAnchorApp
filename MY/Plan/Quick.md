~~

Meaning of "heart" in first sentence is confusing.

First paragraph should be reversed:
- Big concept. >20% want both STORY and STRATEGY
- the rest is the blah blah

Second paragraph is organized correctly.
big idea is in the title!  (99% cant do both)

Story+Strat only on Desktop
??? Why???  what is it about desktop?

~~

Show me that desktop Strategy + Story crushes either alone.
(since you are arguing doing this for mobile will be a big win)
