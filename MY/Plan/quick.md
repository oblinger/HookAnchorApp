DO joins SV as a CTO

Dan recently sold his third company and will be joining our already strong computer vision team.

He as Lead hundreds of millions of dollars in innovation in AI/ML, as a program manager at DARPA which includedsuccesses like IBM’s “Watson” Jeporary playing system “Watson”

He has taught at Machine Learning course at columbia, author 25+ patents, and lead global teams of 50+ engineers in delivering advanced AI/computer vision/robotics solution, as well as help ship over $3B in IoT solutions.

He brings brings a proven ability to deliver mission critical software scaled software along that is simultatnously   leading cutting edge research driven innovation.

Dan is excited to use his technical background for our socially important mission of radically expanding the basketball stats to a much wider range of

Dan is also very excited about potential for great social change with sports visio.  We will bring to every althesel what the elite athletes have today:  player specific stats, and player specific “highlight” reels.  This promises to change the game for very wide range of players that don’t have access to such advangates today.

I have known Jason as both close friend and colleague for over 15 years and have always appreciated his leadership style and ability to execute.  Over the years since DARPA we have been actively looking for a way to join forces, indeed I was one of the first people Jason called when he had his vision for an AI-driven Basketball stats.  SportsVisio.

Over the last 2 years I have enjoyed being a sounding board for many technical aspects of Sportsvisio's execution, and now that I have sold my previous company, I am in a great position to (finally) join forces with Jason as the CTO for SportsVisio.  Independent of my connection to Jason, I have been watching the Cambrian explosion of startups building on recent advances in deep learning with an eye towards founding or joining one.  Many transformative new companies will be born during this period---I am thrilled to be part of this revolution!

QUICK BIO:  
Dan began his research career with a PhD in Machine Learning from U Illinois Urbana-Champaign then working at IBM Research and teaching at Columbia University he authored many first tier publications and almost 30 patents. Building from his individual contributor work he joined DARPA (alongside Jason) and funded over $200M in R&D focusing on Machine Learning as applied to Vision and Natural Language Processing. One of his programs, "Machine Reading," provided the basis for IBM's Watson technology used in their Jeopardy playing system.   After DARPA he moved to silicon valley where he has founded and exited three companies, including an AI-based clean tech company, and a robotics company with a general purpose in dexterous eldercare robot that required building out a 40+ person Ph.D. team spanning a dozen plus subspecialties.

  
  
  
  

BIO

  

In the decade and a half that I have known Jason, we have actively looked for ways to join forces, and I am excited to see that this is finally happening.  Advances in Computer Vision have spurred a Cambrian explosion of computer vision based-startup, now is the time these new companies will cement their positions in these new markets, so I was looking for an opportunity just like this to be part of that revolution.

  

I have a PhD in Machine Learning from UIUC and have used that background as an individual researcher at IBM's Watson Lab and Teaching at Columbia University, publishing dozens of papers and hold almost 30 patents. Expanding on my IC work, I joined DARPA (alongside Jason) and funded over $200M in R&D focusing on Machine Learning as applied to Vision and Natural Language Processing. One of my DARPA programs of note was "Machine Reading." in which IBM developed their  Watson Jeopardy playing system.   that unified knowledge across tens of thousands of books to best humanity in answering Jeopardy questions. After DARPA I moved to silicon valley where I have started and exited three companies, a specialized payments platform, a robotics company building a general purpose in home dexterous robot, and an AI-based clean tech company. In the past I have built 50+ person engineering teams, including a team of 40+ PhDs that spanned the globe.  I can't wait to dig in and make myself useful here at Sports Visio!
