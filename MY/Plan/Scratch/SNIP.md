Observation:  

When one makes a mathematical contribution (a new theorem or defintion) one uses terms that are "universal"
-- The term have consistent usage across all mathmatics:
- Its meaning is precise and consistent across all of mathematics, and 
- there are few alternate formulations of the same or nearly same idea

When one makes a computer science contribution (write code) one uses terms that are NOT universal.
-- The terms do not have consistent usage across all of computer science
- their meanings are not conserved
- there are many alternate formulation of the same or nearly the same idea.

One cannot combine knowlege based on incompatible terms.  Thus math knowlege (theorems) are combinable while computer science knowlege (code) is not.

The result is that mathematics is cumulative in a way that computer science is not.  For example (math example & CS example)

Could one formulate 



 a meaning which is consistently used across all of mathematics


you "say" something in mathematics (e.g. write down a theorem) you use terms

### 2021-00-00  Fox news egregious
For those interested in seeing the details regarding this pretty egregious case you can see the original video from Fox News on the wayback machine here:

https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20220206_020000_Unfiltered_With_Dan_Bongino/start/1740/end/1800

Evidently, Fox edited this clip mere hours later when the error was pointed out.  And Dan Bongino acknowleged the error in a subseqent show on air.  Still he claimed that the error did not affect or related to the content of his message.  Pretty silly since it directly contradicted it.

Here is the corresponding WalletHub article listing the HEALTIEST cities:

This definitely does show Dan on Fox as not caring what the facts really are, he want to show Democrats are bad.  Indeed it shows he is very willing to ignore dramatically contrary evidence in order to make this case.

==>  Waymo reduced maint turn around by 23% in 2021.  In support of it:
- Created metric this turn around was based upon
- Designed and implemented comprehensive dashbord for analyzing maint delays.
	(this was the primary information soruce used by team to affect this turn around)
- Worked directly with data to identify 5-6 specific recommendations presented to and adopted by the team to reduce turn around.


exclusively used in order for the team to idenfify the changes needed for the turn around

### EXPLANATIONS

HERE IS HOW TO USE THE SNIP FILE
- HEAD -- Each snip begins with '###' and an optional title characters.
- ACTION -- Each snip is added here first, but then copied to a location for storage or subsequent editing.
- NEVER DELETED -- When the file gets long it is moved to archive, but this log of snips is never deleted, just duplicated to other places.
- The SNIP's body extends to the next '###' prefix.
- The '.' indicates that a note has been processed, or determined to not need processing.  W/O this mark it is possible, a snip should still be copied somewhere.
-
