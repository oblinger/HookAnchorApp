Life:
- Experience we have
- Contributions we make
- The Growth we experience, and 
- the Connections we have

All Meaning is constructed meaning, there is no intrinsic meaning:
Still such meaning is real.

SHORTEST THREAD FUTURE REASONING
- In order to conclude that something at least as strong as X will occur within a time frame one need not be correct in 'picking the winning tech' but rather just correct about the viability of a single thread, and correct about the human desire to persue the ultimate goal

SINGLE THREADED REASONING
- Not the only way for GAI, but it is sufficient for GAI

ABSTRACTIONS 
MICRO THEORY BUILDER
THEORY OF MIND

THEORY OF ONE SELF and ONES OWN MIND

THEORY OF TUNABLE KNOBS WITHIN THE MIND

THEORY OF INDIRECT MANIPULATION OF SELF BY CONTEXT SETTING OF SELF

THE GOAL
- HARDER -
	- - Not trying to build system that can perform a task
	- Not trying to build system to learn to perform a task
	- Trying to build system to learn to learn to perform task
	- Focused on learning where 100% of inputs are bootstrappable
- EASIER - 
	- Not all things need to be learnable in all ways, but rather for key capabilities there is a way to laern it.
	- Allowed to rely on a strategic teacher that already knows the concept to be learned.
