Incari,

I can very much appreciate the pain that you are responding to. Countries like the USA and China have their agendas and often treat Europe as something of an afterthought even when the those agendas might have GREATER impact in Europe than they do domestically for them.  I do understand that pain, and how that pain might generate the very natural reaction to defend against injury by becoming less dependent and thus more in control of ones fate.  

This reaction is both natural and logical, but in my opinion, is ultimately counter productive. I have served within the US government directing hundreds of millions of dollars in advanced R&D funding as a Program Manager at DARPA. I met with my counter parts in other nations and saw many strategies as executed across the world. So my opinion is based on some boots-on-the-ground experience.

Let me start by first acknowledging some wisdom in your response: I am a software guy, and I cringe at the levels of bloat that comprise the modern software stack. You are right, it is massive and ripe for disruption!

FIRST ISSUE: 
But it is misguided to imagine a large scale initiative
First misguided idea is that
	

also I think is a misguided strategy.

SECOND ISSUE: wont be one thing.  it will be a handful of interlocking tiny things which no one can predict in advance


THIRD ISSUE:  it wont be top down.



FORTH ISSUE:  And in my opionion this is the most important adjustment in thinking here...  adusting the goals itself.

biggest adjustissue. The way the goal is framed can be productively adjusted.  



- yolo-6
- yolo-x
- Better fingerprinting of each track?  as a way to improve tracking
- Read PR comments (for Martins )
- Mike:  I am thinking about creating a visual and textual architecture
- Martin's detector is becoming main
- P-check
- Plus-minus - team doing better
	- JASON: Idea to use percentages.  better to use 'headroom' analysis
	- Vishal has idea for removing tracks of stationary

alpha tech. tom strats program.
did not go to STR.  NLP stuff.
what was not for me @ facebook.  
Reserach MGR.  every 6 months gotta have stuff
- had six guys or less
- he did the database back end
- had some. bert GPT, transform
- Active learning (he is a fan)
	- Tight cycle: take the newest game
	- use embeddings space (two heads team vs team)
		- train on lots of teams lots of players ()
	- butt heads (need to )
- Better way to do hand annotations.
- Use court lines (gives us court lines)
	- but if that fails
	- Avil


Deliverable:
- Headroom analysis
- Annotation expertise
- Game repo & workflow

Dr. Hassler:

TEMAZEPAM - A couple years ago you prescribed Temazepam for occasional insomnia.  The stuff is great, it knocks me out, and does not last into the morning.  As directed I use it very occasionally.  Indeed it has taken years to use up the bottle!  I would love to get a refill.

PRILOSEC - The lung doctor asked me to take Prilosec as an experiment to see if my persistent cough was related to acid reflux.  You commented on my visit that if it was working for me, that we needed to move me to another medicine since ones body adapts to Prilosec.  Indeed I have likely waited too long to switch... now I really get noticeable acid reflux if I stop taking Prilosec for a couple of days.  What should I switch to?

LIVER RESULTS - My liver numbers (Bilirubin, AST, ALT) are often a bit too high.  I am working on this thru diet (fiber, fruits, etc.) But so far, I have not really dropped them much.  Still working on it!  I just noticed a test result from 10/7/2019 (CPMC-E) that was an indicator for possible HEP-C.
Did I ever get checked for HEP-C?  Should I?  It seems a long shot, but I wondered if there could be a connection.


It is difficult for me to get into the office, but I am happy to make a paid remote appointment, if handling these requires our interaction.  Just let me know.

Thanks,
Dan


It is anchent history, but I had a high hep-c test score in 10/07/2019
Since this my liver numbers are always a bit into the red zone

Homeocyctene




Hey everybody, thanks for the welcome hellos!   Jason called me one evening two years back to tell me about this cool idea that was intellectually right in my back yard. He was right about that, and right that it IS a cool idea. It has just taken me this long to get free of other commitments and get over here. Glad I made it! I don't officially start for a few weeks, still I hope to get a chance to chat with everyone before then. Excited to be here!
