This is a complex question to answer as it has some layers:
The short answer first:  I think you are "dad" for sports visio, and your job is to provide a sense of ultimate accountability trying hard is not good enough, results are what count.  It was appropriate, and it was not "too much" it was constructive.  It was also very clear prioritization, getting rid of bugs in hoops is higher priority than all other goals.

But on wednesday of last week we all left the management meeting saying oh there is only one bug in the Queue, and Jack saying, I think we have turned the corner on Bugs.  So the 


than solving ingest methods, than making the app more usable, than hiring 

to all of the team based on final results, not just on 'good effort'.  you are appropriately disappointed and were very clear:  delivering a bug free hoops app is higher priority than all other things.  I think it is

Nadav,
I really appreciate you humoring the westerner here.  Thank you!

I think there are two key differences with the Oslo accords:

First, among those who were given autonomy in 2005 there were many who still promised to wipe Israel from the map, they never rescinded that promise and, no surprise, when given the chance they try to fulfill it.  I propose an Enclave where membership requires and oath to proactively protect everyone including Israel from domestic terrorism.  Some will certainly lie but I think many who want out will not.

Second, I am not proposing that Israel needs to reduce its surveillance in this Enclave.  Indeed the existence of and prosperity of this area is tied to its ability to keep terrorism out.  To join this area one must be friends with Israel, one must accept the need for the invasive surveillance needed to keep terrorism out of this area.  So careful surveillance of this area is easier than the rest of Gaza since it is done with the blessing of its members.  Now I want to put ultimate responsibility on the enclave for its own security so it is less of a force imposed from without, and more an action take from within.

But no problem if it is at Israel's digression as to how quickly and how much of the investigations are done via Palestinians.

You may ask, so what is in it for the Palestinian?  Why would any join such an invasive Enclave?  Prosperity.  The west and Israel both need to reward those few willing to sign up for Israel's security.  We reward proof in action, with Jobs.  Initially as this community is tiny, the cost is also tiny.  As the community grows the cost of supporting its economy will also grow, but the benefits in reduced security will also grow.  I also think the ability for businesses to operate in this region could greatly enhanced.  Presently Israel must restrict things a simple a concrete into Gaza as it will be actively used for attack.  Since this community is so much better monitored (by Israel in tight cooperation with Enclave authorities) it is more possible to allow business operations knowing that monitoring is so much tighter.

You may say that no Palestinians will sign up.  Perhaps few will initially.  But that is fine.  It provides Israel a tiny Enclave where it can prove just how friendly it could be to Palestinians if only Israel's security is assured.  And demonstrating this for the west would raise Israel's standing a lot.  It could point to this Enclave and say:  "see, if our security is assured, then we can be quite friendly indeed."  And I think this would be very instructive for Palestinian's too.  You tell me as a Westerner I cannot really understand Israel's position---you might well be right about that.  Still I would say it might also be hard for you to wrap your head around the Palestinian mindset that explains away Israel's prior offers of peace as not "real".  Such a Palestinian has concluded that Israel can never be a friend to Palestinian even if Israel's security is guaranteed---that is really just Israel's excuse for bad behavior.

Notice this enclave is not proof that Israel will ever relinquish security control over Gaza (since Israel is not doing that).  Instead it is proof that Gazan's could have a prosperous life if they were friends with Israel---at the price of having invasive monitoring.  That is probably a new thought for many Palestinians, who have bought into the propaganda that Israel intrinsically hates them and hopes to keep them down no matter what.

Whatever this idea is, it is quite different than the Oslo accords.  Your thoughts?






Yeah it would be terrible, but we could compute an F1 score for raw OCR.  since it makes no predictions on many images we could compute the F1 for an ROC curve that drops to random chance predictions once there are no digits being predicted.  Do we have F1 numbers for the gallery itself?

And do we have percent of images that our OCR makes a predictions?   We could impute a very rough F1 by assuming 10% precision beyond that point.  and then the area in the rectangle given the precison and recall for the OCR system.

This would be an F1 of .15 or something like that.

Not sure, I was just trying to impute something.

Thoughts?  (and in any case, do get me the actually F1 numbers for the OCR when you get bya
