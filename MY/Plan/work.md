The short answer first:  I think you are "dad" for sports visio, and your job is to provide a sense of ultimate accountability trying hard is not good enough, results are what count.  It was appropriate, and it was not "too much" it was constructive.  It was also very clear prioritization, getting rid of bugs in hoops is higher priority than all other goals.

But on wednesday of last week we all left the management meeting saying oh there is only one bug in the Queue, and Jack saying, I think we have turned the corner on Bugs.  So the 


than solving ingest methods, than making the app more usable, than hiring 

to all of the team based on final results, not just on 'good effort'.  you are appropriately disappointed and were very clear:  delivering a bug free hoops app is higher priority than all other things.  I think it is
