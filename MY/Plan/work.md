This is a complex question to answer as it has some layers:
The short answer first:  I think you are "dad" for sports visio, and your job is to provide a sense of ultimate accountability trying hard is not good enough, results are what count.  It was appropriate, and it was not "too much" it was constructive.  It was also very clear prioritization, getting rid of bugs in hoops is higher priority than all other goals.

But on wednesday of last week we all left the management meeting saying oh there is only one bug in the Queue, and Jack saying, I think we have turned the corner on Bugs.  So the 


than solving ingest methods, than making the app more usable, than hiring 

to all of the team based on final results, not just on 'good effort'.  you are appropriately disappointed and were very clear:  delivering a bug free hoops app is higher priority than all other things.  I think it is

Yeah it would be terrible, but we could compute an F1 score for raw OCR.  since it makes no predictions on many images we could compute the F1 for an ROC curve that drops to random chance predictions once there are no digits being predicted.  Do we have F1 numbers for the gallery itself?

And do we have percent of images that our OCR makes a predictions?   We could impute a very rough F1 by assuming 10% precision beyond that point.  and then the area in the rectangle given the precison and recall for the OCR system.

This would be an F1 of .15 or something like that.

Not sure, I was just trying to impute something.

Thoughts?  (and in any case, do get me the actually F1 numbers for the OCR when you get bya
