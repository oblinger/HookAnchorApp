## THEORY

### ASPECTS OF A TERM
- MEANING CONFLICT BY DESIGN - Unified naming implies there will be multiple conflicting aspects for many terms.
- ARTFUL DECONFLICTION - We reject distinct naming for various aspects (except when applied as a consistent modifier)

ASPECTS:

- FOLDER - 
  ==> It will be the folder containing the item also have the same name as the item.
          ( Thus the item is always named:    Foo/Foo.md  )

- CONTENT - 
  ==> It will be after the preamble of the item (it it has a preamble).

- COMMAND - Command usually external to obsidian

- DOCUMENT - Non textual document within Obsidian
  ==> It will be opened via a command (with CMD prefix)

- TOC ROUTER - 
  ==> It will be in the preamble of the item

- INSTANCES LIST - 
  ==> Stored as a python computed table of pointers appended to the items contents.

- ABOUT - Meta info about this item.
  ==> Can be stored in items contents if simple, else in Meta

- PROJ - Source tree or other project resource folder external to obsidian
- PRJ - Project resources within obsidian
