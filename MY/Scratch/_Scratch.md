Bruce, Sandy, Mike, and Michelle,

Thanks for taking the time for our Thursday call.  There were some exciting ideas that came out of it.  I am especially pleased that we had ideas coming from all different directions, that is the way to find the ones most pressing for action now.  Here are the ideas as we understood them, as well as a few thoughts about what the next steps might be on each idea for consideration in your subsequent team meeting.
