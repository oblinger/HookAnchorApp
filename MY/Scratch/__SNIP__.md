### EXPLANATIONS

HERE IS HOW TO USE THE SNIP FILE
- HEAD -- Each snip begins with '###' and an optional title characters.
- ACTION -- Each snip is added here first, but then copied to a location for storage or subsequent editing.
- NEVER DELETED -- When the file gets long it is moved to archive, but this log of snips is never deleted, just duplicated to other places.
- The SNIP's body extends to the next '###' prefix.
- The '.' indicates that a note has been processed, or determined to not need processing.  W/O this mark it is possible, a snip should still be copied somewhere.
