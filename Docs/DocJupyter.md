mostly a backdrop for folks getting to do really cool stuff, like karate that they don't
know, or such.
But by the end of the second season, the plot holes were so gaping, it was just too
hard to suspend disbelief. we will just pause this life and death situation for a
nice round of flirting.... you know the bad guys will wait.
For me it really just destroyed the whole thing. I am all about taking a show at the
level it intends... its a feel-good action movie. but its just goes needlessly too far.
