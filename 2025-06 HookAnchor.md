[[./CLAUDE]] 


- add flag so user edited obs, anchor, folder commands are not erased & add many defaults

- obs use relative paths, but the folder binding does not expand them.
-  [hook](hook://cnnpage) is broken
- Shutdown is broken

- ctrl-c will copy the hook url for the current command to the clipboard
- remember the last command & timestamp, then if user presses ">" that name is populated 


- Focus is occasionally not in the input box on launch.
- Rename command (should prompt if matching source file and folder should be changed)
- ! will add priority to certain entries.
- Finish [[T Roll]]
- cursor positioning in iterm2
- TMUXIFY - should reliably launch claude in first tab.
