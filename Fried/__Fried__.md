Dan

Have you seen Calendly?

I do it to let people book meetings with me via a URL. Eg:

http://calendly.com/nickallen/30min

It lets you define ranges that you want people to be able to select, & then lets them select them unless you have something on your calendar at that time.
### two books nick gave me
Designing Your Life
Relevant to: The "what opportunities should I say no to?" thinking you have been doing
Quote:"Designers imagine things that don’t yet exist, and then they build them, and then the world changes. You can do this in your own life. You can imagine a career and a life that don’t exist; you can build that future you, and as a result your life will change. If your life is pretty perfect as is, life design can still help you make it an even better version of the life you currently love living."
Competing Against Luck
Relevant to: Your search for a problem for Configurator to solve.
It's basically an ode to concentrating on the problem, not the solution. I think having a framework might help separating the configurator you want from the search for the real market place problem Configurator can solve. If not, it's still a good book ;-)

### haddick
DanO, this is a long essay that I think I will summarize and modify to meet our needs. Don't spend the time on it unless you are really curious ;-)
The article is a pretty close description of the problem we had scaling at Sierra Nevada Corporation and the function that I turned the VP of Technology role into: Product Management. This is what I was trying to describe in our early conversations. It also explains why it is hard for a startup to see the value because the function is distributed around a tight knit team in a typical startup. We are not a typical startup and my intention is to better define the Program Management need and fill it.
