### 2023-09-21  Fellowship of the bug

AND I NOW CHRISTEN THIS GROUP AS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BUG!

In yesterday's management meeting we were all giving ourselves virtual high-fives because we had nailed so many bugs in the hoops app in the last month, and because the number of outstanding bugs was driven down to ONE!  Whoo hoo.  And Jack was feeling pretty good that we had really turned the corner on this.  The reality is that it is difficult to know how many latent bugs are in the app.  And Mark gave us a healthy dose of reality when in 30 minutes he uncovered 6 bugs!!!  UGH!  The reality is that we have had little usage of the app over the last 18 months, and did not have QA for most of that time, so we have built up an unhealthy back log of bugs in the app.  But the dev team has proven they are capable of pounding on bugs pretty quickly once we get them out in the open and ready to hit.

So my plan is to not make a big spectacle out of this problem, nor call folks out for public flogging over this issue.  BUT Mark Lichty is exactly right to be upset at this state of affair, so we the plan is for this little fellowship to crank very hard behind the scenes on this task until we do clear this hurdle.  Here is my thinking:
- Whenever the number of Hoops high priority bugs that are into "Todo" status drops below a dozen or so bugs, we make sure we are pounding on the app to uncover more bugs.  If one can spend 30 minutes on the app and uncover 6 bugs, then it should not take too long to generate a backlog of bugs.
- Any time the number of bugs in "TODO" status drops below 4 bugs, Brian/Jasu please post message into this group to tell us, and we will go into "emergency mode" and really strive to find some more bugs.
- At the same time Brian's team will be prioritizing the resolving of these bugs as fast as that team can do so.  In the last sprint I was happy even with TT at 1/2 time they made good progress, so we should see lots of bugs piling up in stage approve.
- And Brian if we ever get the number of TODO and IN PROGRESS bugs down to zero, please send out a second alert to this group as we are really failing in our mission.

My thinking is we should hit this problem from all sides:
- Mery and Maximo are both going to have very little time to work on this task, so I know we will get some bugs from that direction, but likely not many.
- Jasu will be working with the interns so she can track the number of bugs we get from that angle.
- Jack and James will each be finding bugs, so you can just keep a count and you can tell Jasu as well.
- Mark L is finding external field testers which Jasu is tracking, so Jasu can tell us the number of external testers that are using the app each day, and also let us know the number of bugs found from that direction.

I think if we put consistent quiet effort on this, we can keep a steady stream of bugs flowing into the SW team, and they can pump out a steady stream of fixes and we can stabilize this app as quickly as possible.

One the team is trying everything they can and they cannot find more bugs, then Mark we can have you come back in and see if you can find bugs that others are missing.

Let me know if our mission and approach is clear, and let me know if you guys see a problem with this, or if we should hit it in a different way.
