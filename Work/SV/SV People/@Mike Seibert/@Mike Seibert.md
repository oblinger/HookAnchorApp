### 2023-02-01  Intro 


- "nailing jello to a tree"
- Master class in soft skill execution
	- Reserachers feel empowered and self directed.
	- still making your reservations clear in a way that lets them know, you will be happy to be wrong
	- frequently soliciting consensus thinking and contructive focused discussion on issues
	- I bet you had very low attrition at Alphaworks & BAE


- I personally felt very invited to chime in with questions or thoughts during your meeting. 
	- I tend to be a shoot from the hip sort of fellow, it usually serves me well, but sometimes there are better ways and places.
	- Please just be super blunt with me if there are ever cases where I can better serve Sports Visio by operating in a different way PLEASE tell me!

- Getting deeper into the CV research & experiementation will be the most fun for me, and also most intellectually enriching too
  but if I go where I am most most immediately valuable I should support the larger SW/UX/QA ecosystem around the CV team first.


- Heart breaking customer churn.
	- QA is not robust enough to avoid regression bugs in a live system w frequent updates
	- UX is not driven systematically from those closest to the customers



- Lay of the land.  Our CV team is far more advanced than the structures around it to support it.
	- QA - seems we are using our precious users as first line testers for our tech
	- ANNOTATIONS - can I help build out a capacity to do one-of-a-kind annotations as a fast turn around scaled service for the CV team
	- UX DESIGN - Design flow - UX ideas from our front line guys are not making it down to product design choices at the detailed level
	- MGT TARGETS - upper mgt is asking for numbers that will cause gaming and unproductive hedging, padding etc. if they start pushing hard.
	- ASK - what support do feel the CV team and Sports Visio most need right now.
	- TICKET TRACKING - 
	- Definition of what the March product.  (product going to be:  
		- Pick product & date.  24/hr turn around of stats. just record the game. tripod score a person / team
		- Mid march - systems that goes; 
		- --> what is the ratio/


#to-do

DIFFERENTION
- Unlimited annotations (for practice games)
- Much more in depth




- Pulling teeth to get cloud factory to annotate


TO DO:
- Build a catalog of **edge cases**:
    (info gathered from hand annotation team)
    e.g. three different three-point lines.   lines for multiple courts on the floor.
	- Get this data from cloud factory.   Organize catalog of cases that don't fit.
- Build catalog of **Black swan events** 
	- someone made a basket for the other team 
	- two people with same color and same jersey number on the court
