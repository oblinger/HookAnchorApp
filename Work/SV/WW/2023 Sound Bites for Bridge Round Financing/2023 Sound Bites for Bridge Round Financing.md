### 2023-05-28  Sound Bites From Jason
Dan,

  

No other written handy notes, I just share tidbits from recent good news. Here's one I just sent to an investor who passed last February because they were worried about market fragmentation and building a venture scale business:

  

I haven't sent you any specific updates but lots has happened since we talked over a year ago. We hired a new CTO (former DARPA PM with $200M portfolio in AI, 18+ patents, numerous startups, etc.) We got our AI and software further along and launched our beta in November. We started selling it in April this year (last month). 

  

Most excitingly, we found there are a number of national accounts that I wasn't aware of when we spoke a year ago! We have 5 different accounts that represent $2-$8M in potential revenue that we are engaged with, all of which came through word of mouth introductions which was nice. I'll list them below:

  

1) National video streaming platform (3-400k basketball games, we are exploring a partnership where they'd stream their feeds to us and we would produce JSON files with stats/game data that they would sell to their customers at a markup, we'd be getting $6-8M from that). Demo with CEO in 4 weeks to discuss national roll out plan

2) National AAU tournament/program company  (they are interested in monetizing their tournaments by insourcing their video rights and partnering with us to add value in automatic highlight/stats production. That's another $6-8M opportunity. 

3) National recruiting platform is currently sending us thousands of games per week to create stats for their proprietary recruiter platform they monetize with recruiters and parents (grew from $140 to $12,000 to $32,000 to $60,000 in classic land-and-expand revenue growth in last 5 weeks, potential for $250k or up to low millions as they grow)

4) National fitness franchise with men's leagues across the US that include stats (in discussions about demonstrations at several locations before national roll out, $3-4M opportunity)

5) National video streaming platform in a different vertical, $5M+. Have a meeting with the new CEO to discuss partnership

  

We went from $0 in revenue last month to $65k ARR in the last 6 weeks or so, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised that there are more national opportunities than I anticipated when we spoke. 

  

I also invited you to a call this week and one next week so you can hear how I deliver it. But it's obviously a moving target as we progress, I try to make it current with what's going on. Let me know if you have any great things I might be missing!

  

Jason
