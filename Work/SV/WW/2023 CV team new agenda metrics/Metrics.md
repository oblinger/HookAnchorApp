@Sarthi it looks like we could easily active player it out of the basic action log right?  But my understanding @maxim is that there is a standard annotation format that we have been getting from the annotation team.  Can you share an example of this format here for @sarthi to see.  if we can use the actually annotation format that is probably best.
