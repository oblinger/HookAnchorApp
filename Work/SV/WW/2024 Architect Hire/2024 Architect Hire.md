On a forward looking basis, I am tempted to add a single row the the data sheet called “Other owners”

The idea is to try to understand what other people besides the candidate had ultimate responsibility that their enterprise site was stable and functioning.

Many candidates may have been senior developers on a large enterprise site, but they were not really the one with the “buck stops here” responsibility that the site was stable and always up.  To vet this I think we just explicitly ask the candidate who else had such responsibility, then in discussion we can understand the particular role our candidate had relative to those others.

I added three such rows. 47,48, 49, that can be used for upto 3 major system they owned.

what do you think?
