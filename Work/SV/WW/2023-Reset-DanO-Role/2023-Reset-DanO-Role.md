### 2023-05-15  Executing the reset



### 2023-05-08  FRIDAY DISCUSSION - Key needs / Simple Plan



- **AI-SHIFT** - Both personal interest and best value to company it is clear that overtime I will shift increasingly towards AI.  its not in question.
- **ULTIMATE ROLES** - But we should get clear about ultimate roles targeted for the three of us:  here is a start; how we max our respective value; discuss/confirm:
  - JASON (Investors & Sales).  SAM (Operations both internal and customer facing).  Dan (AI and SW).  
    JASON (CEO gravitas & abilities).  SAM (Company Ops.  High-stakes client decision making.  Org building). DAN (tech depth in both AI and SW)
- **IN WEEDS BUT UP SOON** - Roles, Processes, Escalations, Delegations (instant tracking only as needed, very targeted origination from me)
- **SAM-DAN SPLIT** - Sam/Dan long term split.
	- Customer Facing Needs, Annotation optimization, and PM details represent a MASSIVE complexity.
	- Hiring Choices, SW Processes, Technical / Architectural choices, Annual Evaluations, 
- **ON AI-SIDE**   
	- Joint Planning - Tempo, Making Bets, Parallelization.
	- Cleave Parts - ML deep throw.  Drive shot replay mode.  AI-record product.
	- Lean-in-vs Sit Back; Divide & conqueror; consensus leadership.

- **REPORT-TO CHANGE** - If ever, then now.
	- TEMPO - have a good working relation w/ both.  Still it is awkward to ask if we can squeeze something a bit faster.  I am not their boss!
	- DYNAMICS - either report or compete:  Brian hid:  test;  silence after speaking up.  
	  Mike hiring; demos; radio silence anytime I suggest or ask; what it we XXX, that is in next sprint;   can feel the chill.
	- STEP BACK - process, report-up, escalate
	- STEP IN - Jointly driving tempo & tactical strategy.
	- BRIAN'S SIDE - Just ratifying what already is: focused on hiring, architecture, technical deliverables.  Cust Facing flows up thru Jack as now, exit ASAP.
	- MIKE'S SIDE - Make very few changes; establish his "kingdom" & chain of command as forcing function for us to talk.
		- Progressively suggest ideas for tactical velocity &
		- Dig into applications deeper applications of DL in player tracking.
		- Cleave off "special ops" & fold results into larger flow

- ML PARTS
- 	- Wanted player ID on shot map; even if we needed to ignore many false negatives and just pick the ones we were confident in.
		- Only 50 frames / 3-second long tracks;  only 60% accuracy when we get a shot on Jersey.
	- Asked about doing a experiment using specially prepared training set just to see if DL could be helping --> will be doing that in two sprints.  UGH.
		- GRZ Already tried for a month; I was not happy w/ his approach, still I am sure I am not going to just walk in, have an idea and save the day.
		- It will take many tries and many ideas, but it would be good to get into the thick of it!  (will take focused time and effort on my part!)

- **BIG CHANGES** 
	- Lean in vs. sit back.
	- Cleave off pieces for independent action
	- Divide & conquer
	- Consensus leadership


- STAGES W/ AI TEAM - 
	- Attend meetings & contribute as Mike is.
	- Plan w/ mike looking for tactical moves to achieve increased velocity
	- 


- We need a VP-ENG & ultimately it should not me, but for now it will be me.
- Leverage Brian where he is best: in the weeds on this issue or that issue, and keeping scrum org.
  => Maybe we replace him, or we expand around him
- Make the report to structure explicit so I can straightforwardly direct the team and have clear authority to create processes etc.

- Drive tempo and leadership in both SW and AI
	- Report to clarity will allow me to work more firmly & simply w. Brain
	- Report to with Mike will allow me to drive tempo
		- Switch from sitting back accepting, to leaning forward suggesting.  each of us working closely w/ some is better.
		- Unified strategy leverages the small slices of my time, and his time too.
		- Best uses our FIVE guys for different roles sometimes, not just all doing the same.
		- Overall just drive TEMPO

AI-side
- Need to be in the week-to-week details with Mike to push for tempo
	- Initially with a light touch, just
- He has solid intuitions and a ton of CV experience that complements my ML experience, and he is a good team-lead giving good tactical advice to his team at the high level.

Sam, 

Jason and I had a text message exchange on Thursday, we were noticing that a lot of our acute failings right now could be fixed by getting your operational leadership into the mix.  Figuring out how structure your leadership into our customer and operation success are key to allowing Jason to more fully focus on sales and fundraising and me on technical leadership in AI and SW.  More important than that, I think we need this ASAP just to keep from loosing our existing customers!

  

Jason asked me for some concrete ideas in that area, I have some, but the devil is in the details in getting these structures right.  I am worried in particular that you will need the right levels of support below you in order for this arrangement to be workable for you.  Perhaps we should schedule a 3-way call in the near future to just talk about such an alignment.

  

--Dan

  

  

  

Here is Thursday's text conversation:

  

DAN:  My biggest fire of the second is the fact that two days in a row now, the MM team got stuck… we lost a WHOLE evening of work, now our team is reacting and they will be off for a day.  Structurally this is very broken.  (Not blaming, Issac is pulling our fat from the fire as we just have no other QA for the next week at least). But I want to fix this, either by pulling our team forward or their team back.  will keep ya posted…

  

JASON:  Yeah, we need to get Mark out of that process and let you and Sam run that process. Mark just runs around doing whatever comes to mind. He’s got a great startup/hustle mindset but it breaks easily and isn’t efficient and doesn’t scale well.

  

DAN:  Very good hustle… but he is ANTI-process and he speak at one volume level….   11.   😊

  

JASON: Exactly

Everything is an emergency, nothing works, he told us this earlier, etc. etc.

Love the hustle and motivation to get things done but it’s exhausting too

You and Sam also care and get stuff done but without injecting noise into the system

  

DAN: Well it tears up the team.  So at the very least he needs to be buffered.   Yes I would **LOVE** to get sam into direct management of some of these parts, I think it fit him super well.

  

JASON:  Agreed. I’ve already asked him to get more involved so loop him in

He technically owns annotation since Jack works for him now and that’s an operations function. 

  

DAN: +1!

  

JASON: He’s a little stressed with the finance stuff being neglected but that’s because he likes to do everything on time and cross every t

  

DAN:  This is a key function, and a fast moving one, but it needs leadership!

  

JASON:  

I’m ok with ignoring that stuff for a bit and managing this since it’s super important and filing tax forms with Florida or whatever isn’t. 

Plus James and Charlotte aren’t available at the moment due to finals and Kate is leaving

Once they’re done it will be better since they’ll be free Ft over the summer

  

DAN: +1.  I think we need to figure out a good structuring from a Roles and Responsibilities perspective that will put Sam in the right position to lead that function and have the right boots on the ground folks to support him too.  Will copy this conversation for him to see too.

  

JASON:  Excellent, totally agree

  

DAN: +1

I think it is also essential if we are just going to

aligning me more into deeper technical leadership in SW and AI


dreaming of ways that your prowess 

Sam, 

Jason and I had an text message exchange on Thursday and I told him I would copy you on those texts since we were talking about how to split customer success and product/project management to be led by you, away from technical SW leadership, Architecture, etc. to be led by me.

I think figuring out how best organize the three of us in order to get , so we get the most benefit from your leadership is 

Here are those texts, and also the beginnings of a document I have been noodling on regarding how we might best split our roles to be utilize our respective talents.  I was very excited to learn this weekend that you are already taking point on the relationship with Cerebro.  This is *exactly* the kind of splitting that I was dreaming we might do!!  Because there is SO many nuanced, high-tempo details in the customer-facing work, we will  need to provide you with strong support, still I think it is a great match for you experience, and will allow me focus in areas where I have best match to my background.  Here are the texts with Jason, and also that beginning of the document I had been noodling:









### 2023-05-05  Why Change Report To

#### SW Side - documenenting what is already true
- The change on SW side is actually just documenting what already exists in practice.  Brian already brings everything to me before bringing it forward you guys Jason/Sam
- We already strategize about how to meet our goals in everything from how to combine multiple hires strategically within budget.  to ways to handle back end data, to 
- I already delegate things down for management by him within his team

#### Would let me push tempo in a clearer way
- he is a pliable guy, so me merely suggesting that maybe we can aim to push a requested Mark feature before the weekend might be accepted w/o me having formal authority.  

#### Most Impt: Escalation and Reporting
- Being Brians boss make it clear who he reports to.  This allows me to create unambioguous escalation and reporting requirements.

in my future world I will be far less in the weeds of many of the day to day issues of the SW team, BUT we will have very practiced pathways of escalation and reporting, so w/o even checking in I am already confident that when it is critical for me (or you guys) to be in the loop on some issue of the moment, we WILL be in those weeds... and not 3 hours later, but just as soon as the issue presents.

Ideally from the lowest to the highest in the org we all have our escalation rules so we alert upward quickly, and ideally with progressively greater wisdom added to the alert about how to resolve it.  And indeed when it is running correctly.  Brian wont even need to alert me in many cases, yet nothing slips thru the cracks because he WOULD alert me when needed.

This is the jet fuel!  It allows me to maintain strong outcomes, w/o being in the details much of the time.



Will allow me to build clear escalation & reporting requirements that will allow me to eventually step back in hours per week

### 2023-04-26  Manhattan Project

  
Jason, 

I look forward to our discussions when you get back.  By the way, last week I saw your post about the difficulties of being a founder and about some successes that Sports Visio recently had.  Your piece was intended as a testament to the importance of grit, but it included one short phrase that to me telegraphed real anxiety that everything might just blow up, and perhaps also of feeling alone with that struggle.  It made me feel that in my zeal to get into the weeds at SV I was not attending to larger 'rock' and not attending to the emotional side of the 'pushing together' part too.

  

Hmmm, well I think the team is still quite fragile in their ability to take on too much work.  They thrash is slow down easily, we see that in their output over the last year.  So we must take care with their focus, but I think I can push them notable more in taking on greater urgency and tempo.  Often the team is satisfied if something takes an extra day or three. This might not see a large loss, but I think it can have a toxic compounding effect.  So I wonder if my 'stone pushing' might be the break-neck delivery of our first end-to-end scaled capability?  I don't think we know enough today to select the right singular "bet the farm" target, but perhaps soon we might know enough to select the right first one?  A "manhattan project" can be a great way to galvanize a team, it is worth a thought.

  

  

  

For your consideration:

  

IDEA #1 - REAL TIME FULLY AUTOMATED AI-STATS -- Both your idea of a court side coaching tool and the Baller-TV contract point in a direction that is really a green-field product space.  If we could nail either use case at a level of performance that was clearly worth paying for, then investors would shower money on us even if our actual market traction was quite nascent.  **IF** we prove that we can actually do it to a level that is of sufficient quality to be paid for, then I think investors will little doubt that will also pay.  We would be so unique in that space, I would feel awesome about our funding prospects.

  

==>  DECISION CRITERIA:  If we obtain a level of commitment from a Baller TV that they would pay for some very specific level of quality, and we feel we can hit that level of quality, then I would be of a mind to adopt a "bet the farm" level of focus on this one problem so that our still-shaky team could shave weeks off its delivery time for its first sellable product in that area.  And I would *love* the adrenaline of driving such a mission at break neck speed.

  

  

IDEA #2 - SCALED ANNOTATION -- The second 'manhattan project' is probably closest to our current path.  We are already supporting AI-based human annotations in a generalized haphazardly kind of way.  Instead we could be systematically assessing and driving down ALL of our per-game costs, from all angles, human, AI, UX, and working single mindedly towards proof that we are actually far-far below any cost point that others could provide.  This is already a key goal of ours, but we are not really systematically driving down costs across the board.  There remains a lot to be done there that we are not presently doing.

  

==> DECISION CRITERIA -- Unlike the first idea, I think this one will only give us a strong A-round if we have actually have hard numbers on our side, and have achieve notable scale.  So we cannot embark on this path w/o having strong options for getting SCALED customers in a short time frame.  And of course we ALSO need to really verify that our AI will make large total cost reductions even when we factor in the expected costs of processing, etc.  

  

  

  

IDEA #3 - TEAM DELIVERY -- My original understanding of SportsVisio centered its value to parents, players, and coaches at the individual team level.  This still makes sense, but you highlighted the challenge that customer adoption could be slower and more organic.  Perhaps we could show investors that given proper exposure (at a tournament or such) we do achieve important levels of adoption from the teams that attended this event.  Such evidence might make the math work where cost of customer adoption is paid back within the first few months of usage.  Such proofs can pave the way for massively scaled out reach campaigns as they are largely self funding.

  

==> DECISION CRITERIA:  This path is harder to support than the others to justify, but it would begin with our gut level belief that we can get some notable single digit percentage of adoption at each tournament, if we cannot even achieve this level of adoption that pathway is not an idea first product pathway for us.

  

  

I bet there are other 'manhattan projects' that we might consider, if will be fun to talk about them.  And more fun/important still to be able to commit to and execute our first one.

These are all ideas that we have discussed at some level, but I wonder if getting the clarity need to commit to a first of these paths sooner than later, might give us clarity around the best boulder to be shoving?  





(and )
There is 





of If so, then driving this per-tournament adoption rate would be key to justifying our bridge and A-rounds?


These are just three starter ideas, perhaps there are others?  I am not certain about the best move here, and maybe we don't have enough knowlege to select one path to win first.  , but I have a sense that it is crucial for SV to pick a winner and drive vigourously towards that winner.  I fear we will run out of cash if we peanut-butter our efforts across multiple efforts evenly.  I also suspect my value as the technical co-founder should be picking such an operational goal, and driving that boulder UP THE FLIPPING HILL!

Thoughts?

maximize its velocity in delivering the sellable solution 



If we received solid signaling that Baller-TV would pay for some defined level of real time fully automated stats, I could lead an effort with our existing teams to rapidly deliver this capacity.  We should understand this is a "bet the farm" kind of approach since we are presently configured towards bets focused on delivering capacity directly to end customers, and aiding annotators rather than providing fully automated stats.  Still, with focused attention we could address the issues of compute-speed, scaling, and driving full automation accuracies on a few key annotation types.



You began talking about the importance of finding good co-founders, adding a phrase about the anxiety of needing to ensure that one never pauses with that rock.

### CUT PASTE

Jason, here is my take on where we might want to get our company, where we are now, and how to get there:

  

  

**BIG PICTURE OF OUR DESTINATION** - We will be >$100M if we hit a all five of these functions, and will dead if badly miss any one of them:

- JS   INVESTORS - We need to raise the funds required to execute.  (Owned by Jason, with Sam and Dan's support)

- JS   SALES - Long term differentiation will come from partnerships and customers; both are very very sticky!  (Overseen by Jason, with head of sales, and head of marketing owners)

- DO   AI-STATS - Ability to execute, to fund raise, and produce novel value are all enabled by AI.  (Overseen by Dan)

- DO   SOFTWARE - Stream of polished SW product produced by a high-functioning SW team. (Overseen by Dan, with VP-ENG owning tactical execution)

- SC   OPERATIONS - Full range of corporate, financial, HR, etc. operations.  (Overseen by Sam)

  

  

**TACTICAL GAPS**

  

TOO MANY HATS - Part of our historically poor/slow execution is perhaps due to Jason wearing three critical hats and SW team not getting enough attention.

==> offloading these is key for progress

  

  

MANY SW TEAM PROCESS GAP - Software team is improved, but still well below sufficient for a robust customer base.

==> Short term improvements critical for immediate functioning.  (See section below)

  

  

MISSING OUR VP-ENG - 

==> Must make due without a dedicated VP-ENG but gap is very apparent in our current execution.

  

  

MISSING A SOFTWARE ARCHITECT

- We don’t have resources to fix many of our bad choices, but it is key that we start aiming in that direction.

- Several bedrock choices in backend design having us traveling down a road of code that will soon need to be discarded, the sooner that we fully understand better paths more able we are to avoid digging the hole deeper, and opportunistically move away from those choices too.

==> only requires moderate time, and done opportunistically as key decision points are forced as customer need drive us forward.

  

  

TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PRODUCT DESIGNER -

- Our first round of technical product development is of very low quality.  Even if our apps worked as intended, their UX is ENTIRELY unusable.

- Our present rewrites will staunch the bleeding of usability for tournament play; but will also be thrown away as we extend beyond it.

  ==> Ultimately this role must be filled or perhaps the SW architect above could support Agus and Jack in this role.

  ==> Until then there is no choice but to have me fill this role.  (Fortunately this should only require a moderate amount of time)

  

NOTE: A strong VP-ENG could potentially serve three gaps (VPENG, Architect, and Technical product designer) leaving me to focus on AI

  

  

  

**AI TEAM** - Making progress but with relaxed tempo

- Team in making progress, but with a *very* relaxed attitude and tempo.

  e. g. I noted a quick experiment on could run to assess if a deep learned model might distinguish players in cases the tracker found difficult. 

  ==> if this showed promise I would want to pivot more energies in that direction immediately.

  This was agreed as a promising direction, and said we can start investigating that next sprint.

- As a research org, I want to maximize the number of experiments per day per person across the group as a means of maximizing velocity.  In principle the whole AI group wants this too, but in practice I think we are pretty far from that way of operating.

  

- Our hiring process is weak.  

- Talent cross has been great for us, they have brought every strong hire except Grzegorz.

- When we let folks go, it is only after a painfully long time.

- When we hire folks we don't do any practical testing for the hires, and not many interviews.

- I am doubtful we are in a great position to bring in strong PhDs, though as long as Talent cross keeps providing good CV engineers, we will be ok for some time without need for strong Engineers.  Still it is not ideal to be entirely reliant on an single external partner for this key activity.

  

- The team nor Mike are really ready to own customer facing code:

- QA testing, release cycles, etc. are all lacking, and the team is just not in that kind of mindset at all.

  

- Mike is a pretty good "Chief Scientist" his intuitions generally feel very strong.  He would not provide strong value leading algo work in deep learning.  (I would be notably better for this, though in the end we would also want to hire a recent PhD focused specifically on this as well as we go to that next level, likely about one year away).

  

==> If his role stays constant, i expect Mike may ultimately choose to stay. 

- He  leads scrum where many ideas and nearly all of the coding comes bottom up.

- He is not pressed for tempo as long as team is making progress.

- He is far from the 'hot seat' of having live customer facing code.

  

  

  

  

**BIG PICTURE FOR A PATH FORWARD** -- 

1. Key functions need to be offloaded from Jason so only Investor Relations and Sales remain.  (no focus on team or product)

2. SportsVisio SW and SW team functioning both need to be rapidly improved and stabilized, then after A-round a strong VP-ENG is hired.

3. Inner circle oversight is needed for both SW and AI.

   Dan can provide both, with greater initial technical focus on SW delivery, then shifting towards AI progressively as SW is stabilized.

  

  

  

DETAILS

  

REPORTING STRUCTURE

- We should have both Brian and Mike reporting to me as the inner circle member overseeing these functions.  Considerations for this:

  - BRIAN desires to go full time, and perhaps become our VP-ENG.  Going full time, if SV can afford it, will definitely be a win for us, he has good value.  Independent of that we, need to be sure he has all qualification we would want if he were to become our VP-ENG.  But either way, him reporting into me would not shift his chances for this position, so as long as he understands that my aim is to lean towards the AI team, and there is no future where I would become that VP of ENG, I think this shift will be ok for him.

  - MIKE told me it was "ok if I replace him" when we first met.  Since then I think he has really grown to love his present role, I sense a subtle but distinct elbows out aim to hold on to all responsibilities in order to keep the role.  I can see why he would grow to love it:  he is now the resident "grey beard" grandpa "chief scientist" passing wisdom to a CV team that is cranking away on various cool ideas. I think this is a great role for SV, and hopefully we can keep him in that role at least part time.

  

  

OWNERSHIP OF OUTCOMES AND RESOURCES

- Constitutionally and life-circumstance-wise, Mike is not the right person to be owning make-it-or-break-it outcomes. 

- Not just because he is not certain if he will stay full time long term.

- This is a 'fun ride' for him, but not a do or die for him, if things get rough, I don't see him digging deep.  

  That is potentially ok as a Chief Scientist, but not as a member of the inner circle.

- As the person who IS serving this role, it is important that I have ultimate control over the resources and agenda needed to achieve it.

  

CHAIN OF COMMAND

- With Mike in particular, I think it will be quite valuable to firmly establish chain of command clearly as:

- As a good leader I should always highlight contributions of those that report to me directly up the chain.  Still it is important that that all strategies, hiring, prioritization is done first in conjunction with me, and then I am turning around and getting clearance with you.  We are far too tiny to be trying to limit communications or such silliness, he can talk to you about anything he want anytime he wants, but if he understands that it is ME that he is negotiating with, then all elbows are naturally in, and he and I are now working *collaboratively* to decide how to allocate resources and set priorities.

- Early on, especially as my attention is still focused within the SW team, I expect I will be forwarding along his agendas with only the lightest of touch.  In the early days in practice he will still have great sway and autonomy.  I have zero desire for micromanagement.  BUT:

1. This will tend to weave me into the team over time even while my attention is divided, whereas my present circumstance tends to weave me out of the AI team.  Further, in practice it will become clear to him that this long term role chief scientist can remain available even as the group gets more operational.

2. Chain of command puts me great position to just gently nudge a bit in cases where we agree an idea is good for exploration, but his inclination is to pace the group, his boss can suggest a quick experiment be added in here or there to push tempo -- if he pushes back, I would be inclined to acqese, but it is still very different than my making a suggestion like that today.

3. Most importantly this ultimately sets me up to being owning slices of the technical work as they are already flowing thru line of authority.  We just need to dynamically decide how to cleave off resources for that work.  (see my current thinking about technical work I might cleave off below.)

  

  

MIKE'S LEAVING

- If Mike left, Dan would abruptly shift to focus on the AI-team, potentially with Jason and Brian covering the SW team depending how stable things are.

- if Mike stays, Dan will naturally own outcome, tempo, and delivery oriented aspects of the AI team's work.  e.g. assessment, algorithm delivery and reliability. etc.  Likely I would also run independent threads of ML-algo related experimentation and research.

  

  

INVESTOR RELATIONS

- I would serve as the primary face of SV from a technical perspective.

- This needs to be an inner circle role, and from an energy and presence perspective I am a better match for that work.

  

  

Lets talk about this approach, I am interested to see what you think.

  

Cheers, 

Dansh


### Nick

Nick,
- You were very right: I needed to "man up" and remember "you are DARPA Fucking Dan!" as you say.
- At the bottom of this email, I have a summary of my 1/2 call before he left for Japan, where he basically said, 
  "You are exactly right Dan, so what do we do about this?  Give me some options, which I plan to do upon his return"
- He also posted a linked-in note where he said it scary to be a founder with much riding on this success and to be "alone" at the top.
  I think he wanted / wants more support from me as a co-founder, and I am not living up to expectation (cause I am diddling around in the weeds.)
- Ball is in my court!  My plan is to send my summary below, at the same time I call him about the ideas in it.


### 2023-04-24  Jason Response

Jason, here is my take on where we might want to get our company, where we are now, and how to get there:


BIG PICTURE OF OUR DESTINATION - We will be >$100M if we hit a all five of these functions, and will dead if badly miss any one of them:
- JS	  INVESTORS - We need to raise the funds required to execute.  (Owned by Jason, with Sam and Dan's support)
- JS	  SALES - Long term differentiation will come from partnerships and customers; both are very very sticky!  (Overseen by Jason, with head of sales, and head of marketing owners)
- DO	  AI-STATS - Ability to execute, to fund raise, and produce novel value are all enabled by AI.  (Overseen by Dan)
- DO	  SOFTWARE - Stream of polished SW product produced by a high-functioning SW team. (Overseen by Dan, with VP-ENG owning tactical execution)
- SC	  OPERATIONS - Full range of corporate, financial, HR, etc. operations.  (Overseen by Sam)


TACTICAL GAPS

TOO MANY HATS - Part of our historically poor/slow execution is perhaps due to Jason wearing three critical hats and SW team not getting enough attention.
==> offloading these is key for progress


MANY SW TEAM PROCESS GAP - Software team is improved, but still well below sufficient for a robust customer base.
==> Short term improvements critical for immediate functioning.  (See section below)


MISSING OUR VP-ENG - 
==> Must make due without a dedicated VP-ENG
==> VP-ENG ultimately needed to fully cover 


MISSING A SOFTWARE ARCHITECT


TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PRODUCT DESIGNER -
- Our first round of technical product development is of very low quality.  Even if our apps worked as intended, their UX is ENTIRELY unusable.
- Our present rewrites will staunch the bleeding of usability for tournament play; but will also be thrown away as we extend beyond it.
  ==> Ultimately this role must be filled or perhaps the SW architect above could support Agus and Jack in this role.
  ==> Until then there is no choice but to have me fill this role.  (Fortunately this should only require a moderate amount of time)

NOTE: A strong VP-ENG could potentially serve three gaps (VP, Architect, and Techi)



AI TEAM - Making progress but with relaxed tempo
- Team in making progress, but with a *very* relaxed attitude and tempo.
  e. g. I noted a quick experiment on could run to assess if a deep learned model might distinguish players in cases the tracker found difficult. 
  ==> if this showed promise I would want to pivot more energies in that direction immediately.
  This was agreed as a promising direction, and said we can start investigating that next sprint.
- As a research org, I want to maximize the number of experiments per day per person across the group as a means of maximizing velocity.  In principle the whole AI group wants this too, but in practice I think we are pretty far from that way of operating.

- Our hiring process is weak.  
	- Talent cross has been great for us, they have brought every strong hire except Grzegorz.
	- When we let folks go, it is only after a painfully long time.
	- When we hire folks we don't do any practical testing for the hires, and not many interviews.
	- I am doubtful we are in a great position to bring in strong PhDs, though as long as Talent cross keeps providing good CV engineers, we will be ok for some time without need for strong Engineers.  Still it is not ideal to be entirely reliant on an single external partner for this key activity.

- The team nor Mike are really ready to own customer facing code:
	- QA testing, release cycles, etc. are all lacking, and the team is just not in that kind of mindset at all.

- Mike is a pretty good "Chief Scientist" his intuitions generally feel very strong.  He would not provide strong value leading algo work in deep learning.  (I would be notably better for this, though in the end we would also want to hire a recent PhD focused specifically on this as well as we go to that next level, likely about one year away).

==> If his role stays constant, i expect Mike may ultimately choose to stay. 
- He  leads scrum where many ideas and nearly all of the coding comes bottom up.
- He is not pressed for tempo as long as team is making progress.
- He is far from the 'hot seat' of having live customer facing code.




BIG PICTURE FOR A PATH FORWARD -- 
1. Key functions need to be offloaded from Jason so only Investor Relations and Sales remain.  (no focus on team or product)
2. SportsVisio SW and SW team functioning both need to be rapidly improved and stabilized, then after A-round a strong VP-ENG is hired.
3. Inner circle oversight is needed for both SW and AI.
  	Dan can provide both, with greater initial technical focus on SW delivery, then shifting towards AI progressively as SW is stabilized.

P. S. Here are the break out sections listed above:


TACTICAL REALITIES FOR THE SW TEAM
{{NCK: here I want to summarize}}

VP-ENG - We need a very capable VP-of-Eng who is not Dan (if you want any AI)
- B+	BUG TRACKING
- B-	WORK TRACKING
- C+	WORK (Sprint) PLANNING
- D	RELEASE COORDINATION
- F	QA & TESTING
- F	ESCALATION
- C+	SPRINT PLANNING 
- -	ROADMAPPING 


INITIAL TECHNICAL TASKING IDEAS FOR DAN WITHIN THE AI TEAM
I have "homework" to do in getting up to speed within the AI team.  Understanding the two years of work that has already been done is a crucial time consuming step, and is getting facile with the code base.  The latter especially will be quite time consuming (but fun).  Prior to that, there are key activities I might take on in the early days even as I am still focused significantly in the SW team:

1. INVESTOR DEMOS - 
2. LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF OUR PERFORMANCE OVER TIME - 
3. USE OF DISCRIMINANT MODELS (ML) - for distinguishing players that are confused by the tracking algorithms.  This is complementary to our current tracking based approach is can naturally be explored in parallel with integrations as we find success with the underlying ML.
{{I will add one more here}}

As I begin regularly attending the AI stand ups I expect I will find other time-limited technical tasks I can begin to take on.  In order to not gap in my delivery of value it is important we we stage my delivery of technical value.  I have "homework" to do in getting up to speed within the AI team, coming to understand the details of the two years of work the team has done will naturally occur over time.  Grzegorz tells me there is a steep learning curve required in order to become facile authoring code within our current fancy and complex platform.  It will be fun to do, but will also require some efforts that don't immediately provide value to the team, so those efforts need to be done sparingly over time.







POTENTIAL TRAJECTORY
- Establish new reporting structure
  - On AI side make reporting chain strong; Tout virtues of Chief Scientist role that offloads operational responsibilities.
  - On SW side hold out possibility of VP-ENG role (but don't lie)
PHASE ONE 3-6 MONTHS
- SW Process establishment 3-6 months
	- Create & harden v1 processes 
- IMMEDIATE
	- Chain of command ownership of all key management levers: budget, hiring, roadmap
	- Dan manages with an extremely light touch: 
	  - Provide collaborative & deferential support 
	  - Bias towards passing what he proposes along with fewest edits possible
	  - Go out of my way to highlight his contributions & downplay mine to gain collaborative
- MONTHS 2-3
	- Take on some outward facing, evaulative, or operational outcomes



PROPOSED TRANSITION TRAJECTORY
- MAY - Release Cadence
- JUNE - Escalation Trees



GAPS
- OWNERSHIP - Fire in belly, up late ensuring it happen.

### 2023-04-21  discussion



~ Copied To ~ 

For SportsVisio to win it seems there are three big objectives that we need to meet:
(1) Raise the funds required to execute
(2) Deliver fully-automated AI-based sport stats
(3) Deliver a stream of polished SW products from high-functioning SW team


- If it is to deliver full AI stats, then I need to build a road map from where where are today to that goal, and it needs to be structured well so it leverages Mike if he stays and does not gap if he leaves.  BUT
	- I am not happy w/ our hiring process:
		- Vishal is the only non-Talent-cross person we have not fired.
		- TC loves interviewing w/ us because no test, just quick interview
		- On both sides we bring folks in for LONG time before firing
	- Not happy that we are running all our guys fully parallel because we are not sure who is able to deliver value.  (its a good tactical hack, but shows where we are at)
	- Roadmap might have Mike & I splitting technical responsibility:
	  e. g. maybe I would have him run a 'tracking' task force delivering player halos & while I coordinate others to deliver the balance of the
	  AI capabilities.
	  But it would be a UNIFIED vision & elbows would not be out as it is clear who owns responsibility for the outcome.


- You might say, No I prefer Dan owns the delivery high functioning products and SW team, and Mike owns delivery of autonomous AI as part of that team. Thus Dan needs to be ready if Mike leaves his role.
  But Dan's scope is delivery of the product as a whole:
	- But again not I am not in an ideal position to shape towards success of that larger role either:
	  Yesterday Scott half-delivered a few solutions for Mark that were not sufficient, but he did not test them well enough to ensure they were sufficient, so in the 11th hour we are scrambling to cobble alternatives.
	- If he reported into my org, I would be having a discussion with HIM about ownership today, but he's not my guy, and I don't own that delivery.


But presently I don't own the delivery of any of those things.
--> I have been nipping at the edges of things and providing tactical value anywhere I see great need.  We have some dumpster fires to that adds value, but 
- This does not put me on path to delivering fully autonomous AI stats, nor high-functioning products and high-functioning org.
- Worse I am not in the ideal position to be shaping things right now towards those deliverables.
- And this ambiguity harms efficient collaboration as elbows can be a good way to jockey for responsibility.
