WHAT IS NEXT


### 2023-02-16  Jason conversation


Still believe in original vision:
- Single camera Pivo, on phone, stream to cloud, back to another phone in real time.


==> turn around time.  not yet <24h.  don't tell customer when video is ready.


SOCIAL SHARING - cannot share.
- Watermark click-thru & brand
- one button share on social media.
- Auto-generate their clip.


==> Minutes per player.   thousands of games.


==> Customers being able to manage their own 
- roster, or game.


BETTER STATS
- Can't see summary stats for a team
- Min played per player
- blocks/steals per players
- Shot attempts where the ball does not get near the net
- Analytics / Insight into 
	- Shot chart makes misses
	- players fast moving before shot


CLIP EDITING
- Music in clip
- All others in black&white and one kid in , or highlight circle under them
- Explosion on the hoop, streak on the ball
==> FEEDBACK CAPTURE (Focus groups; Alpha testing group)
- systematic questioning.


SUPPORTING OTHER GAME TYPES
- 3-on-3 games

# WHY?

#### Product Spec
- [ ] Jason: forest for the trees (forgot lost hoop detections as needed for non-AI pivo system)  -- mike said

#### Alpha Test Server
- [ ] Jason.  the regression on recording has occured for lack of having explicit alpha testing servers.  I hear you loud and clear regarding too many user data sets.
