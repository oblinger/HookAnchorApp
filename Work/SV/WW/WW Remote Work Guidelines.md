- [ ] I tried many things... and now am going to reach. 
- [ ] He did message me about not having access to the repository.


- what gets written down
	- RTFM!

- getting stuck
- availability
- use of scrum management time
- bubbling up problems.



- Energy, Tempo, & Burnout, Velocity & Throughput
- This is a start up, not a 9 to 5 job.
	- definitely does not mean work until you drop; definitely does not mean work to burnout
	- IT DOES mean high tempo
		- stuff has got to MOVE, and frankly it means that key things need to move alot faster than they have previously.
		- but there is no way to move your fingers faster, or think faster, and long hours is a fast path to burn out.  

- So the only path is to work smarter
	- You as the IC are the key to all of this....  You are sitting alone in your home office or at the coffeeshop.
		- in the first analysis, you are the only one who knows that high efficiency is not happening right now in this hour.  only you.






## SV STRATEGY 

~
Product Planning and Prioritization
expressed as 4 distinct feature backlogs

USABILITY
Removing bugs and frictions
Improving UX on all app

AI-AUTOMATION
Using AI to replace/support human game annotation, 
or to support any of the other pillars

CUSTOMER ACQUISITION
New ways to drive customer adoption/retention
or new/different value propositions


SCALING


Key Ideas

Ordered By Planned Delivery Time
Insight:  Prioritization is messy and ill defined.  But final delivery order is never ill defined.  Thus agreeing on delivery ordering is both most valuable for team's planning and most well defined for management.

More Apples To Apples
Insight: Each pillar has its own metric for improvement that help prioritize within that pillar.  But no useful metric spans all four, thus priorizing within pillar is much more apple to apples than across pillars.


Key Ideas

Bigger Ideas - Ideally broken into broken into several one-sprint deliverables
	e. g.  Pivo Manual Tracking; Pivo ball tracking; Pivo hoop tracking; Cerebro stats export


Ever Advancing
Idea: Each item represents a measurable advancement.  Even as we shift across prioritizes we still advance as long as we still deliver features whole features here.


Dialating
Idea: Top few features on every backlog are specified in full detail, and broken down into small enough tickets to provide accurate sizing
Beyond this features are progressively less specified, and their exact ordering is less accurate.


Key Ideas

Fluid
Idea: Exact ordering of each backlog represents up to the minute understanding of our corporate prioritize.

Stable
Idea: Management will strive for backlog stability, but not at expense of corp efficacy.  
Idea: No matter what sprints are locked down at the beginning of the sprint, separate small-feature mechanism is used within a sprint

Time Efficient
Idea: Many fewer prioritization discussions / meetings.  Management boils all prioritization complexity down into a simple delivery ordering.
This ordering is the key output need for dev planning.

Plantastic
Idea:  Knowing the next couple bigger deliverables allows teams to opportunistically allocate effort to optimize multi-sprint output.


Key Ideas

Rapid Reprioriziation w/o rebuilding backlogs
Insight:  High user churn would indicate instantaneous emphasis on pillar one, over pillar four, but usually would not reorder features within in any pillar.


Pivot Ready

## ORG CULTURE
### This talk


### Remote Work Reality
- Alone in home office, with #@$%&@ still not working!


### SV Report Card
- Heart, 
- Skill B

### Finger pointing
- All of the leaders need to do this at some level
- It is very corrosive 
- It does make for a fun place
- It makes folks feel insecure

==> Focus on what 


### Screwing Up

- Its expected, 
- Its ok, 
- We will survive it
- It will get better

- It is disastrous
- It is unacceptable
- It must be corrected yesterday
- We must expect better
- It will get better


### Fun Fun Fun !!

- We are all "do-ers"
- "do-ing" is one of the things that make us feel alive
- Best run startups provide best



## STARTUP LIFE


### TEMPO - TEMPO - TEMPO

### Every hour counts!!!


### Measuring Excellence
- Your regular output.  (difficult to measure size & support)
- Your team foo.  *Concrete* ways, big and small 
- Ultimate total contribution.



### Things I have heard  (that I didn't love)

I don't need to do X because Y won't be ready before Z

Its like inflation...



### Things I have heard  (that I didn't love)

Its because of person P that we still don't have capability C.


### Things I have heard (that I didn't love)

I am still working on ZZZZZZ

I will just go and do XXXX and deliver it !!
- A very common impulse for the best junior devs
- And often is not the ideal reaction
