- what gets written down
	- RTFM!

- getting stuck
- availability
- use of scrum management time
- bubbling up problems.



- Energy, Tempo, & Burnout, Velocity & Throughput
- This is a start up, not a 9 to 5 job.
	- definitely does not mean work until you drop; definitely does not mean work to burnout
	- IT DOES mean high tempo
		- stuff has got to MOVE, and frankly it means that key things need to move alot faster than they have previously.
		- but there is no way to move your fingers faster, or think faster, and long hours is a fast path to burn out.  

- So the only path is to work smarter
	- You as the IC are the key to all of this....  You are sitting alone in your home office or at the coffeeshop.
		- in the first analysis, you are the only one who knows that high efficiency is not happening right now in this hour.  only you.
