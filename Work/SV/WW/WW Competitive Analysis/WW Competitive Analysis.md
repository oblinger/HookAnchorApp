Objective:
Produce a detailed view of our competitive landscape that include information about our competitors as well as our customers.  We will produce this analysis in layers with the first draft gathering more basic information across the whole space, and later layers providing detailed and quantitative order-of-magnitude assessment of key factors (such as growth or size).  Ultimately this analysis will be a key factor in choosing micro growth trajectories in both features and sub-market segments.

Approach:
- SNOOPING - detailed forensics on stuff they explicitly publish.  Pricing plans, blog entries highlighting capabilities, or example team usage of the tech, etc.
- SIGNUP - Sign up for their service to see scope of usage (e.g. search for team names within a geo)
- 


COMPETITOR ANALYSIS:
- List of competitors broken out by key capacity (e.g. recording, stats)
- Tech: breakdown of abilities of their AI (ball track, state of play, etc)
- Pricing: 


- COMPETITORS
