### 2024-07-11  Hack-a-thon week


Briones/James:
I am thinking to fly myself Martin, Maxim, and Juan to a central location for a nine day hack-fest.  We just need a hotel with good internet and some modest conference room (or perhaps even a large two-room hotel room suite).

Obviously this will speed our dev time, but also increase our burn so we want to keep prices low.  Still I am asking these guys to hack-code around the clock, so if prices are similar in order to get to a slightly cooler location, then I think it is money well spent.  but not if it really bumps the prices.  And of course we should consider the cost of plane travel, car travel, and food.  We probably will not have it catered, but instead will just get takeout for our meals.  And many days we will probably go out for a modest dinner,  else hacking 18 hours/day in a small room starts to feel like slavery.  ;-)
And I think one day we might want to find a slightly unique place to eat, but still not too expensive.

I know that many times Briones has prices out such a thing, so James if you want to just drop this on Briones feel free to do that.  Either way, I would like to get estimates for 4 cities, and any other if you think there are better ones:  Buenos Aries, Bariloche, and Mendoza in Argentina, and Las Condes district in Santiago de Chile.  you can see a short note from Maxim below:

If it would be an entire week in some place in Argentina it could be Bariloche o Mendoza but I dont think you will find direct fligths from the US to there. Another place could be Las Condes district in Santiago de Chile. Chile has direct fligths from USA and Santiago its just 2hs from argentina by plane. And its more safest. I think Chile was ranked as the safest place in Latin America.

Team:
I am excited that we are moving from a company with prototypes into a company with scaled products in the field.  Hooray!!  As part of this, it is important that in emergency situations we are able to respond in real time.  To aid this we are having all employees provide contact details with focus on how to contact outside normal hours in the case of emergency.

Please add your info to your slack page as explained HERE.

Thanks,
Jasu



Below is an example supplied by Dan O, along with his explanation of the info provided:


Email:  dan@sportsvisio.com
Phone: +1 415-494-9499
Whatsapp: +1 415-494-9499
Skype:  oblio00. (rarely checked)
Emergency:  +1 408-480-0508 (wife Qingling)

Contact Order
- Slack/email preferred defaults
- Text for faster response
- Call for fastest response
Alternatives & Emergency
- Whatsapp/Skype available for intl
  But not checked regularly

Waking Hours:
11a-1a EST. (8am-10pm PST)
Normal Hours:
11a-9pm EST. (8am-5:30pm PST)


NOTES:
- Notice I am including all channels you might use to contact me.  Normally you should just use my email and slack, but for faster/emergency response I am providing all channels I can think of.
  And I included my wife's number since she is more glued to her phone than I am, so she is better emergency.
- Our "Normal" working hours are hours where one can usually find us at our computer, and we can always contacted w/o concern.
- Our "Waking" hours represent the hours that one could contact us w/o waking us (or our kid, etc.).  It is not normal to be contacted during these hours, and there is no guarantee you will actually get through.  But "waking" hours indicates it is not a great hardship if you try to contact us during this time.
- Contact preference explains the best ways to try to make contact.  In my case Slack and email are my preferred method, texting will get faster response, still calling is best for fastest response.






As we are moving toward scaled production we need to have emergency contacts for folks for worst case situation.
	Normally we will be following our call trees and willn



### 2024-03-22  Life Time


LIFE TIME QUESTIONS

I know J/B and A have been doing ton of planning for the life time launch; I don't want to become another cook in the kitchen, this is just a bit of spot checking.  JASON I am putting your eyes on this so you decide this schedule introduces too many risks.  If so you may need to help push back on requirements coming in if you decide we are set up to fail.  I have no idea if that is true, I just raise the question.  I am on alert that it seems life time kind of slow rolled our ability to work on this rollout and now seems to be pushing for a pretty aggressive release schedule.   
In the end it will be better to disappoint them by pushing back on an aggressive release schedule rather than disappointing them with angry customer complaints about our crappy software, and about lost or corrupted data.  

Here are some other good questions for us to answer:
(1) OVERVIEW -- JACK can you provide a link to the high-level plan that contains a list of key dates for actions and commitments?  (if we don't have it, we should build it)
(2) SHIP DATE -- What is our projected ship date where all functionality for the V1 system as been added?  What day is that projected to his production?
(3) ACCEPTANCE DATE -- What date is an executive from life time going to give us a thumbs up acceptance that they have tested our system, and are happy with its performance?  What is the name of the executive that will make this determination?  Do they already know they will be doing this?  What information do they need in order to assess our system?  (And if they have no idea, we should suggest to them what kind of validation they might consider, and what data they would need to have in the system to do their testing.)
(4) TRUTH DATE -- What is the date that our system will become the single source of truth for some portion of life time data?

(5) REFINEMENT DAYS -- As the plan is now, how many working weeks to we have after ship date until acceptance date?  (It should be the difference between acceptance date and truth date right?). And how much flexibility do we have if we or they say the system is not ready?  Are we able to just push the TRUTH DATE our a sprint or two if needed?


My thought is that if we don't yet have a plan for an explicit acceptance step from Life Time that it is pretty important for us to add it.  It greatly lowers our downside if our system corrupts user data records or just is unusable and folks complain if their execs signed off saying it was ready, and it also lowers the chances that it wont be ready.  It also makes them feel a little better about pushing the schedule, since they are the ones doing the pushing.

### 2023-05-06  Urgent Ticket Creation and Dispatch

ISSUE: We are sometimes needlessly loosing tempo because of management overhead in reacting to fast moving critical issues.  This is very understandable as there is a lot going on.  Still perhaps a bit of process can greatly help this.

ISSUE: Some bugs/urgent features are being transmitted in slack but not getting into bug tickets, and more importantly are not getting into fully specified Jira ticket form and dispatched fast enough.

QUESTION #1:  We might require a greater number of folks who report issues, put them directly into Jira.  This saves some copy and pasting mostly on the part of Jasu and Jack.  But I am not sure if we should push for this or not, here are some considerations:
- folks still wont always do it.  Slack is so instant, folks will go to a slack channel first any way.   "holy crap XXX is not working!!"
- even if they create Jira tickets, they will often not be detailed enough for action either Brian, Jack or Jasu will need to really look at the ticket and understand, has all of the needed information been captured?  If not then will need to proactively push to get more information right as they read it.
 
OBSERVATION #1:  for the fastest moving issues/bugs maybe slack is the best first place for those issues.  people seem to watch slack more than jira tickets... it is more set up that way.  I know for sure that senior leadership is more tuned into slack than anything else.  Thus regardless of what we do with Jira, we probably ALSO want a slack message for critical issues just so it has correct visibility.  

QUESTION #2:  Thus maybe the simplest is for us to report directly in slack, and have that copied into a Jira ticket at the time it is dispatched (by Brian/Jack).  Alternatively we could require that a Jira ticket is created by the person reporting the issue, and then simply reference that ticket in slack.  That would also give visibility, but I expect there may be resistance and/or bad ticket writing, of course you guys can edit the ticket as you dispatch.  What is best here?



ISSUE: We have too many "highest" priority tickets, so when an even higher priority ticket comes into the system, we have no way to watch those specifically.

PROPOSED SOLN: We add one higher priority as existing priorities are already used pretty well:

Medium: It is natural for this priority to be the default priority.  Medium means an issue is important and needs to be address in a timely fashion.
High: Indicates that an issue is 'high' priority.  It is specifically being pulled above the default priority.
Highest: Indicates that an issue is especially important, if it is not going to be address within the next sprint, then a remediation discussion is REQUIRED with the customer.  The ticket itself should explain what remediation the client has accepted if getting it into the present sprint is not going to happen.
CRITICAL: This kind of issues is a CODE RED.  "drop everything". wake people from sleep, and 


ISSUE: Quick look board

### 2023-05-07  Product Spec

ISSUE:  We are moving fast and cutting corners, as expected in startups.  But in the area of product spec it is really biting us hard!
ISSUE:  We are NOT writing even the barest of spec in some cases, and then are unhappy with what is built.
ISSUE:  Or we do have a spec, but then we do not gain consensus about whether or not we are going to follow it.
ISSUE:  Compromises will need to be made and we need a mechanism that will FORCE such compromises to be made rather than simply executing w/o consensus.
QUESTION:  Dan favors Google-Docs over Confluence for ease of editing, and for the look of the document, but others may prefer confluence.  Either works well as they can be linked easily to a Jira ticket.  We could just have two directories and allow the spec writer to choose, or we could pick as a team either option.  (Dan is ok going confluence if the group prefers it.). What should we do?  Confluence?  Google?  Both?


PROPOSED FLOW:
(1) A Jira ticket is created for a new capability.  @Brian or @Jack will add REQUIRES SPEC to the top of the Jira ticket's description.
(2) A Spec document is created in the specs folder with the same prefix as this Jira Ticket (e.g. "MOB-255 ...") and it linked to the ticket.
(3) At the top of the spec document is an approvals section with three kinds of approvals:  an approval that the spec is complete, an approval from the product team, and an approval from the SW team.  Each approval is a single bullet specifying a date, approval type and signing initials.  e.g.
    - 04/17 Spec Complete.  [JP, BF]
(4) Brian, Jack, and Jasu ensure that that work does not begin on the ticket until all three approvals are in place.


MECHANICS:
- COMPROMISE - System forces compromise, since work is blocked until the proposal can be shifted until we get approvals on all sides.
- ACCOUNTABILITY - System also forces accountability, since someone needs to put their initials saying they approved.  (multiple will sign if it's a collective decision)
- REVERSAL - We NEVER alter an approval line once written.  In rare cases an approval could be rescinded, but if this is done it is APPENDED with a date and initials to indicate when this change happened.
- COUNTER PROPOSAL - Anyone can make a counter proposal as a separate document and attach it to the same Jira ticket.
- DEADLOCK - If the teams are at lager heads then leadership can make the call and simple sign either/both sides of a proposal to break the deadlock.


Def



THE CONTENTS OF A SPEC

MOB-255 - Headless game flow with single camera, and existing team

APPROVALS
- 04/17. Spec Complete.  [JP, BF]
- 04/18. Product Approval.  [ML]
- 05/02. SW Approval. [SB]


COMMENT: At a base level, I believe sometimes we need to do a much better job of just showing a completely filled out detailed example of what our system should output.  What that means in each case will be different, but in most cases it will be some kind of attachment to an example which is detailed enough that a QA person could look at that example and confidently say "yes" or "no" if the system's behavior was correct.

QUESTION: Should we be more specific here about what counts as a "complete spec"

### 2023-05-04  WAR ROOM

WAR ROOM PROPOSAL

I am finding our combination of multiple slack channels and the many one-on-one messages that happens during normal company operations are not well suited for emergency situations like Cerebro.  And Cerebro is but the first in a long line of such emergencies that I feel we are not organized for.  Here are the problems I see with normal operations during an emergency, and below an idea I call the "War Room" as a special way that we operate once one of the four of us declare a war.  The Problems:

- SILOED DISCUSSIONS - Much time is wasted because key information is communicated outside of slack or inside of slack but in private communications.  Thus often a decision has been reached, or a new situation arises.  Like Scott is not done with XXX, but relevant people don't know this, and many communications end up being RETRANSMISSION of base information that has already been communicated one or many times in a siloed channel.

- MISMATCHED CHANNELS - Our present channels are pretty well matched to our present processes in 'peace times' but they don't fit very well when all of the sudden we are trying to jam QA discussions with Many Mangos into the stage acceptance channel, or James is putting bugs on Mark Lichty's spreadsheet into prod errors, or me putting a call to arms around scripting a tool for validating manual annotations into general.  The truth in all of these cases, none of the present channels are correct, and so info just be spread around to multiple wrong places.  (e.g. the script tools discussion was spread in Cerebro, general, and is multiple siloed invitation only group chats.  what a mess!)

- FLUID PLAYERS - Our teams are pretty well organized for business as usual. But on a war footing it is an all hands on deck kind of situation.  Often we find talent who can address a fast moving issue might come from anywhere in the company.  We posted to GENERAL for help because it was the only general place we could talk with the team.  That is fine, but it is totally the wrong place to gather team members to actually address a fast moving problem. 


THE WAR ROOM PROPOSAL

- DECLARING WAR -- I propose that Jason, Dan, Brian, or Jack can "declare" a war for the company.  The way I am thinking about it, the person who declares a war is the one who is most central in maintaining status and tempo so usually it would be Brian or Jack declaring the war, often at the behest of Jason.  And in many cases there will be multiple people ensuring tempo and maintaining status, but I think it is good to have a single belly button whose is the 'declarer' of the war and who has ultimate responsibility about tempo and status tracking.

- WAR ROOM SLACK CHANNEL -- The war room is a slack channel called "War Room" 
  
	- EMPTY BUT READY -- This public channel is know across the company, but is normally SILENT.  we never post there if a war is not on, that way when it lights up, everyone in the company knows to read what is there, before reading anything else.  The WAR-ROOM channel lighting up is a call to action for the whole company to at least look in and see if they are needed.
	  
	- MORE THREADING / LESS SILOING -- If I want to ask Scott if he has all the details needed to fix the re-frob-nocator then I would create a single message in the war room directly addressing @scott and ask what other stuff he needs.  THEN I can effectively invite others to that thread by simply referencing them in the reply to that one message.  The one lead message can become a small focused conversation about this topic, but importantly since it is in the war room, other people can see status and potenentially jump in with help.  WITHOUT ANY WASTED TIME REPEATING STATUS AMONG MANAGERS!!
	  
	- OTHER CHANNELS -- In war time this does become one more channel we must monitors.  That is definitely a negative, but I think it is worth it.  Here is my thinking:  We try to almost never have private update comms and favor the war room for such discussions, so there is ALOT of traffic in this channel very very messy.  far more info that we want in other channels.  But we still use other channels as we normally do so they maintain normal status but all the detailed discussions.  This does mean we need to monitor all of those channels, but that is ok for a war.
	  
- WAR ROOM DOC - Pinned to the top of the war room channel is a google doc called WAR ROOM.  The person who declared war will keep key status (or links to JIRA tickets, etc. with key status) at the top.  below that are some sections with relevant details or links to sub documents with relevant stuff.  I don't want to duplicate status that is already maintained elsewhere, so we can just use a URL link.  but often it is valuable to have a rollup summary status ... this where that could be written for all to see.  (we should probably put a timestamp on the status so the reader knows how stale it is.)

- Hourly contract for a Senior iOS/Flutter dev for 2 weeks to 2months of full time work.

- Scope: 

Brian:
I am asking Tomas to give us a contract for an iOS consultant.

There flutter dev rates are something like 2x or 3x our current costs, so I am doubtful that we would ever rely significantly on them.
Still as an advanced team, it could be an interesting option to have at the ready.  I got him to agree to a 2week minimum, which I think is very much pushing there model into places they don't want to go.  I said that we would be flexible about start time if needed, and indicated an openness about support in the future depending on how our company grows.  Here is what I plan to send to him as soon as you thumbs up along with Jason.... it is the structure he and I discussed.


Tomas:
Here are some bullet points as discussed to frame and scope our contract:

- This would be an hourly contract for a senior iOS/Flutter developer.
