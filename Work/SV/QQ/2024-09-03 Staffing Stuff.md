> After our chat and the pressure to increase runway, I could make 100K/yr cash work for full time until series A as long as it was the plan after series A to move cash back up to 200K and have options added during the bridge.    
> I would be still shooting for a total comp of ~300K/yr (full-time) with a mix of options and cash.

> My plan for the bridge round, even before our discussion, was always to move Scott to an as-needed contractor. He is buttoning up a few things in GCP, but I don't foresee needing him until the A round or likely a cheaper replacement after the A round.  But I know he would help us in a pinch as a contractor if we had an immediate need.

> 1) Reduce Naza to 0 hours. He is helpful when needed, but his help is not critical.  I estimate this would slow our mobile team down by ~5% since he is already at reduced hours. However, I would like to hire him back full-time after the A round since he is inexpensive and would help increase our development velocity.

> I don't see any slowdowns with any major features we have been working on.
> 
> Getting him involved after the A would be helpful, but I am unsure about it since his full-time total comp would be 260K.
> 
> 3) Move Julieta Barrionuevo to zero. Many of the strategic things for QA are already in place. Her work on automation will be helpful when we grow a bit bigger, but work before the A round is not critical. I don't foresee any slowdowns on the current features, but I would like her full-time (or someone like her) after the A because we will need her more as we grow.

> 4) Pablo Sanchilli. His costs are small, but he is not working on any critical functions. He is working on automation, which we will need more of after the A round. Could he go over to opps to help James for now?

> 5) Leonardo Almiron. If I had to pick the weakest developer on the team, it would be him. But, he is reliable. And works hard. I estimate his impact would be around a 25% loss in speed on Angular development. I would prefer to keep him through the bridge if we can, but I understand the runway pressure. All these moves would reduce the total spend for software by ~19%, even with me onboard full time.
