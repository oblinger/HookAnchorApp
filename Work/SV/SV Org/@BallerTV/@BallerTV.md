> > Anything that involves a human is not super interesting to us. Definitely only interested in what's 100% automated, and sounds like you are relatively close. We actually have a human powered game breakdown service that we acquired through our NextPro acquisition a couple years ago. We've got a full breakdown platform with a support team in Argentina and the Philippines, but it's generally not that interesting of a business as it is operationally challenging and margins aren't great (and hard to compete with Hudl who does this really well).

Or a licensed model that could run either an EC2 server that we'd deploy or one that we'd convert to run on device if lightweight enough. Could be a general license or per game license. The goal would be simple for basketball to start:

I'd rather partner on this if we can, and we are looking at at least one other big player in the space who essentially can do this now, but they are generally challenging to work with.
