Hey Dan,

  

Here’s that GPU inventory without the markup I mentioned. We’re sharing this with about 40 AI startup leads before listings go public. Pricing is often 50% below most clouds and 70% less than AWS/big clouds.

  

These are live rates that update as startups reserve capacity — first come, first served.

  

Below are some of our lowest-priced clusters. These are the rates most teams start with. Other configs are available if you’re scaling or need specific specs.

  

⚫ **Blackwell (RTX 6000 / B200)**

• RTX 6000 Blackwell — about $1.63/hr per GPU ($13/hr per node) | 8 × RTX 6000 | Tier 3 DC (US/EU) | 1-node min (4 weeks)

• B200 — about $3.20/hr per GPU ($25.60/hr per node) | 8 × B200 | Tier 3 DC (EU) | 1-node min (4 weeks)

  

🟣 **NVIDIA H200**

• Base setup — $1.96/hr per GPU ($15.70/hr per node ≈ $11K/mo) | 8 × H200 | 2 × AMD 9654 | 2 TB RAM | Tier 3 DC (France) | 1-node min (4 weeks)

  

🟢 **NVIDIA H100**

• Starting around $1.40/hr per GPU ($11.20/hr per node ≈ $8.1K/mo) | 8 × H100 | 2 × Xeon Platinum 8468 | 2 TB RAM | Tier 3 DC (Amsterdam / NY) | 10-node min (4 weeks)

• Flexible option from $1.20/hr per GPU ($9.60/hr per node ≈ $7K/mo) | 1-node min (4 weeks) | Tier 3 DC (Houston, TX)

  

🟣 **NVIDIA 5090** — around $0.68/hr per GPU ($5.44/hr per node) | 8 × 5090 | 512 GB RAM | Tier 3 DC (LA / NY) | 1-node min (4 weeks)

  

🟢 **NVIDIA 4090** — around $0.40/hr per GPU ($3.20/hr per node) | 8 × 4090 | 128 GB RAM | Tier 3 DC (LA / Amsterdam) | 1-node min (4 weeks)

  

Happy to walk you through how much you’ll save/options before these clusters are spoken for.

Fair to assume you're running on AWS or another hyperscaler right now?

  

Best,

Emily Gay
