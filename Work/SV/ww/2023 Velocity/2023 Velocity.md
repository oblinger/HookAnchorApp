# RED ALERTS - TACTICAL APPROACH 


**BACKGROUND**: Like all early stage startups there are way too many important things to do all at once.  Like many we are not systematically focusing resources pointedly on the most critical of the most critical, and thus we are loosing significant velocity though avoidable misallocation of effort to a wider range of tasks with lower criticality.

**OBJECTIVE**: We need a simple ranking system for our highest priority tasks, along with a process that ensures strong execution and follow thru.


**APPROACH #1** 

To start with we can just label and tightly track a small number of "Red Alert" issues.  Generally addressing these issues should take precedence over all other other, and should be tracked very closely.

My plan is to capture the issue in a JIRA ticket with Jasu and personally track its resolution, or assign them to be tracked by a responsible other party.




**APPROACH #2** - 

If we find ourselves overwhelmed with too many red-alert tickets, then we can create a hierarchy of such emergency levels. Here is an initial thought about what these levels should be.  Ideally these levels are:
- Properly ordered - e. g. in nearly all cases a level 5 ticket should be solved before a level 4 ticket (assuming similar times to solve the issue)
- Self Describing - e. g. many SV folks will generally know and agree on the proper levelling for each ticket.


Red5	- Five Alarm Fire 	- Issue is causing a key SV app to be unusable for ALL current customers.
Red4 	- Four Alarm Fire 	- Issue is causing a key SV app to be unusable for SOME current customers.
Red3	- Three Alarm Fire 	- Issue is causing significant CHURN by our current users.
Red2	- Two Alarm Fire	- Issue is a GREATEST BARRIER to new customer onboarding
Red1	- One Alarm Fire		- Issue is a KEY ISSUE blocking new customer onboarding


Even this expanded leveling system is really just a start.  Once we are out of firefighting mode, we can develop a roadmap with priorities and planning based on that roadmap.
