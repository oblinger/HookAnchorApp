### 2023-10-02  From Nick @ Realplay

Dan,

Here are two more outfield defensive sessions, with relatively long video: [https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/86mzu1sauyb68oscdonzm/h?rlkey=8abd8jjjdqpy6uht0zpr2j5p1&dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/86mzu1sauyb68oscdonzm/h?rlkey=8abd8jjjdqpy6uht0zpr2j5p1&dl=0).

I’ll get you some more early next week.

Thanks,

Nick

### 2023-10-02  notes to Aaron

  
Ping,

Best luck in your next adventure!

  

  

Aaron, 

Thanks for the videos.  And I take your comment under advisement.  We need to deliver highlights on video as we find them, not as we wish they might be.  In attacking this problem we are getting quite deep into building specialized recognizers and processors thus it is important to have good training data to build from.

  

So we are interested in grabbing many videos to train on, even if the video we must run on will be of lower quality.  A few questions:

— is there a new engineer I should talk to if we have questions?

— Is there a good location we can go inside your site to find videos from the new lenses, maybe it will just be any videos after a certain date?

— and for training purposes are there places to go to find more 1080p videos.

### 2023-09-14  Justin / Jason Conversation

Dan,

  

Here are my notes from a king call with Justin tonight. Give me a call when you can and I can discuss. 

  

Justin conversation

  

3 customers

8, 9, 12 fields

Jersey numbers

Home/away (detect which color team starts the game on defense)

Start/stop of each at bat

  Start/stop just means detecting that they left the box and a new person is in.

$1M in revenue in revenue when finished

  

(Three sites, several thousand across the US)

  

Five main showcases (Stanford, HeadFirst, prospect select, etc.) and a few smaller groups. Those five would immediately present $50,000- $200,000 to charge them for the services. $20pp charge back to the video company. That’s a ceiling. Broken down by $10pp from Realplay, and the rest could be for us. They’re already paying $300-$1200 pp to participate. There are usually 200 players in a showcase. Small ones might be 200, large ones can be 300-400. 7 stations usually per person but not everyone does every one. (Some are for catching, pitching, fielding, hitting, etc.) 

  

The tournament people are charging $250-300 for the video per person. Realplay charges $130 pp if they go B2C, minimum adoption of 65%. The $20 pp is what the providers pay “choppers” to splice the video now. The choppers take 2.5 weeks to turn it around. (4-10 weeks!) 

  

Perfect game, and prospect select run 130 events and 75 events respectively per year. (And 50-150 at each). So about 50,000 players total in events (many are in multiple) This is ALL just for stations and skills demonstrations! 1.5 minutes spent per station per person on average. Typical player does 4 stations. 6 minutes per player then. 

  

This is just baseball. Softball is probably 60% of the size.

  

He thinks we could capture 70% of the $1M market in the first year $600-700k in new revenue. We are spending $500k and they’re doing $100k and we’d do a 70/30 split or whatever to get costs covered. Timing wise it would be three steps… 5% in first 6 months, then 25% in first 8, then 100% in final 4 months)

  

After first year some sort of floating split. Cover cost (hopefully 20-30%) and split 50/50 after that. (His proposal, subject to negotiation… I wouldn’t plan to give him 59% of revenue or even profit for just lining up a customer!)

  

Adding batting cages, down market, global and softball it’s probably $3-4M.

  

$24-26M is the baseball/softball college/HS/travel showcase GAME space. (Direct sales, doesn’t include ads or other things), using the $20 pp price point.
