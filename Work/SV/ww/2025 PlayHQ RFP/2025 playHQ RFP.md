## Issues
- Metrics targets are calculated only on valid games. (but of course the customers must be satisfied with the overall performance of our system even on invalid games too.)
- Reliability dependent availability.  (Nothing we can do if GPUs are not available).
- Assists & Rebounds are in beta in for first 3 months (I want to give us room to fail to hit 85% right away on everything.  Indeed I worry about hitting it even after that!!)
- Start getting training data to work with (We want to ask for training data videos)
- Begin/end game meta data

Rather not talk about these topics as what we have written in the contract will allow us to negotiate better once the contract is signed:
- Data security policies.
- Training on their data.
- Want to be careful giving them enough detailed data that they can use it for their own training purposes.  (Jason/Sean decides if we cave in on this.)
