Sam:

My sense is that with limited guidance our team filled values into our matrix, but not really with actionable/accurate info.  I suspect we will involve them to track details in this process, or perhaps to even keep tempo in or data collecting, but I think not with direct ownership.  Not criticizing their attempt, I think they just don’t have proper context to really perform this.  I think yes or no decisions on each of these will fall down to very specific and different details in each case.  I think we should loop them in as specific sub-tasks get identified.

  

  

  

Jason / Sean:

  

As you know, I am looking for a lower-risk AI product to add to our lineup.  There are a number of options that seem to have acceptably low risk to attempt them in 2024.  Many of these attempt will take us away from our longer term mission of delivering full game stats in multiple sports, thus we only want to attack these if solving them by Q3 will really move the needle in our fundraising.  Thus our initial choice between all except VB-Stats should first be driven by sales traction, since it appears that they might be sufficiently low risk that would could attempt any of them.

  

[Here](https://www.notion.so/sportsvisio/MATRIX-Assess-Low-Risk-AI-Products-a42829e87edf43c3abadec1087967c06?pvs=4) is a simple summary page of my current short list.

  

  

Here are some initial thoughts about how to we might approach validating these alternatives.  (Though of course I am very open to other approaches):

  

- SV AIR - It seems if we got agreement from Lifetime and/or other large customers to use our panning camera solution that would be sufficient support in the A-round, OR if we thought we should show rapid B2C adoption of the solution with increasing traction over time that might justify this path.  

==> Jason what do you think of this claim? Sean how would you go about assessing this market 2024?

  

- MULTI-SPORT SHOWCASE - This seems to be among the lowest technical risk.  Further is seems B2B market adoption could be estimable earlier since it will hinge on mostly on us forging B2B relations with relevant Showcase production companies.  How can we get a handle on appetite for this product?

==> Sean any idea how we might go about estimating what we could sell by Q3?

AI PRODUCT CHOICE

It seems Sam and I were thinking along very similar lines about how one might be able to build a strong AI-product that marries strengths of team-highlights with players-highlights.  The more I think about this combo product idea, the more I wonder if it should be our lead product this year.

[[HERE]] is a quick summary of the idea please have a look.  And that brings us to the big question:

In the next weeks how do we best estimate how many we can sell?  at what price? and what minimum performance is required?  In this area, I am completely out of my depth.  Sam had just ask three coaches and they all liked the product and gave him feedback on how accurate the system needed to be, but how do we go from that up to whatever estimates we will use in our decision making?
