Spiritually in Feb-1-2023 we already have a separated R&D org.
- March-1 we are having meetings
- Summer we have interns

- Is NH an at will state.

VIRTUAL TOUR GUIDE - An Augmented-Reality/smartphone-based virtual tour guide service.  Proposal for a crowd-sourced market of virtual curated tours of popular attractions and city destinations using Computer Vision and Augmented Reality.  Solution supports the logistics of sightseeing (getting to the right location with the right tickets at the right time) as well as both curated and spontaneous tour-guide-provided information. 

ENGINES OF CONTROL - Proposed models for AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), along with analyses of properties that are likely required of all AGI systems.  These proposals serve as the basis for AI-safety work -- assessing the feasibility and approaches one might take to ensure safe usage of such AGI systems.

UNIFORM - A syntax, semantics, and implementation of languages optimized for code/data interchange and for meta-programming. Uniform languages and Uniform Code Markdown take a least-commitment approach in order to maximize ease of translating code and data across disparate programming contexts. The language and markdown are designed to facilitate "LISP-like" homoiconic programming style within the modern programming stack, as well as provide the basis for a marketplace of collaboratively shared and collaboratively defined computation.
