From Jason:


1. Full AI full stats basketball
2. Full AI a second top 10 sport OR Full AI for a subset of a real significant streaming sports by player replay type deal (Baller TV)
3. If cant get something in full AI, would take full AI for something else smaller like Baseball showcase.
4. If cant do 1,2 or 3. show better margin improvements with partial usefully AI.

1. Ex: Shot Tips, Halos
