From Brandon/Alex
Both by Andrew Grove; long-time Intel leader including CEO and chairman of the board.

High Output Management; aimed at both middle and upper management; focused on process & results.  I've finished this one, it's good. This one Nick recommended and Alex seconded.

Only the Paranoid Survive- this is the one that Alex added to the recommendations himself.  A little more geared towards upper management and dealing with major points of change ("inflection points") in company development.  "10x" is mentioned in this book many times. I'm most of the way through this one. I do think a fair amount of what's in here is applicable to startup- and in particular to Aeolus as a whole at the moment since we're making a big change from mostly-hardware to hardware-and-software.
