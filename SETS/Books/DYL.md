KEY CONSIDERATIONS
- FREEDOM:
- ENGAGEMENT:
- PAY:		
  
  
  **FREEDOM**
- **MULTIPLE** -- Idea of working on only one goal for years feels limiting.
  	Want to work on multiple ideas, and follow where they lead, not the money.
- **FOLLOW** -- Ideas not money.  Sometimes importance and money align, and that is great.  But when they don't it is great to ignore the money.
- **SOCIETAL VALUE** -- Ability to work on ideas that w. outsized societal impact
- **NON MEGA CORP** -- Have impact; not primarily/entirely on a corp bottom line
- **TOP EDGE** -- Top edge of my technical ability to operate
- **UNIQUE TO ME** -- ``first reaction should be.  Huh, what?   That is dumb!   or That wont work''
- **CAT PERSON** -- Great joy in choosing tempo / timing of work.  Tend to "get religion" about topic and work frantically.  Other times it is pulling teeth
  
  ==> Such freedom is likely too much to ask.  Just want a chunk of it per day/wk
  
  
  JOB ENGAGEMENT
- Technical Vision Leader -- Spending hours refining and presenting a technical vision.
- Puzzle pieces -- I enjoy thinking how to fit some complex pieces together.
- Talking -- I enjoy presenting and talking about idea.
- Ownership -- Feeling like a own a thing matters
- Value -- Feeling that the work I do actually matters to the world
  
  
  JOB DRUDGERY
- Have to do it now -- When I have to do a thing, even a thing I really want to do, it generates significant resistance.
- Tedious Activities -- Low brain usage activities that are 'too slow' are really frustrating
  
  
  
  
  TECH LEAD
- HARD -- Some part of the task is technically difficult
- DESIGN -- Building APIs, Architectures
- LEAD -- Some aspect of team leading
  
  
  IMPACT
  
  
  
  
  
  
  DRIVERS
- COOL TECH - Spend good fraction of day working on cool tech
- EGO/IMPACT -
- COULD OWN IT - In principle I could own part of what I produced
  
  
  
  COOL TECH
- Based on thinking long about a tough problem
- Innovations I can imagine w/o pencil and paper
- Thinking
- Want job w/o tons of daily requirements
- Want to work on technical & important stuff

## = (2) WORK VIEW / LIFE VIEW / COHERENCY / TRUE NORTH =
 PAGE 40.  250 words each
 Where do your views on work and life complement one another? b. Where do they clash? c. Does one drive the other? How?

### - WORK VIEW
- PRIMARY VALUE -- Why do I work?  To:
	- earn good money,
	- by leveraging my differentiated skills
	- to provide value for society
	- in a way that also affords me reasonable status
- Worthwhile work: provides a net benefit to society as a whole & to specific individuals.
- Money?  I need sufficient cash to minimally justify myself to QL, 
  or to drive rapid readiness for retirement.  (e.g. >500K/yr)
 - Experience/Growth/Fulfillment?  At this stage I am mostly focused on fulfillment.  I am happy for growth and experience, but feeling my work is enjoyable and worthwhile are the dominant factors.
 - How does it relate to the individual/others/society?  
	 - NET GOOD: It should provide value for others in the abstract... it should be a net positive for society.  
	 - SMART PEOPLE:  It should provide daily interactions with smart folks.

### - LIFE VIEW
### - ABOUT ME
- **SUPER DRIVERS:**
	- IMPORTANT - *CREATE* something that really *MATTERS* to society.
	- THINK - Spend time *THINKING* through some technical problem.
- **IDEAS** -- I love to focus on the technical: the big idea, and technical details
- **THE WAY I WORK**
	- **ALLEY CAT** - Like working on several different things, and jumping between then as my interest shifts.
	- **BURSTY** - I can execute well as a burst, but not continuous
	 	(except SW or idea coding in flow)
	- **REACTIVE** - Work easiest when task triggers are presented from the outside.
	- **COMMITMENT AVERSE** -- I systematically dodge certain commitment steps
	- **WORKY** - I am always "working" its my mental mode
	- **LIMIT** - seem to have daily limit (3h), not effective after (for work I don't love)
- **AREAS OF ATTRACTION**
	- **SOCIAL *SYSTEMS*** - 
	- **SYSTEMATIC** -- idea is a systems idea relating to how things work
	- **BULLET** -- idea is single "silver bullet" for some acknowledged problem



Quick Observations:
- CAT -- I jump from idea to idea
- VARIABLE -- impt stuff per day, can vary from near zero to good
- SWEET SPOT
  SWEET SPOT -- I dive to this place often
- technical idea
- "of the mind" -- just pencil and paper, no research, etc.
- MINE -- I feel the idea is one other's don't see
  
  AVERSION
- HOP -- Love pushing deep into an idea, but after certain
- Research
- Execution
- Commitment
- PRAGMATIC SHORT TERM
- COMMITMENT AVERSE at commitment stage
  
  
  PRETENDING -- pretending I might do a thing, but knowing in heart I wont
  With JASON flirted, but was never going to say yes, but spent time pretending
  
### - DAN WORK - The kind of conceptual work that drives me


There is a certain kind of work (lets call in DAN-WORK) and this kind of work is so compelling I tend to work on it even when it is not rational to do so; in to the night; sometimes at expense of nearly anything else.

DAN-WORK = TRANSFORMATIVE, CLEVER/HARD, INTERNALIZED, CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM-SOLVING and MENTORING


CLEVER/HARD
- HARD WORK CAN BE BORING -- work that is just hard, like solving some huge calculus problem is just drudgery.  There are no insights to be found or tricks to play then it is exhausting and not very rewarding
- CLEVER WORK IS TOO RANDOM/QUICK -- work that is just one clever trick has no staying power, in one flash it is over, or you have no ideas and make no progress forever.
- CLEVER + HARD -- now we are TALKING.  I can play with the right kind of mathematical puzzle for weeks if it is the right shape.
  
  
  TRANSFORMATIVE
- LIFE MISSION NEEDS CONSEQUENCE -- even if I can play with a hard+clever problem for a long time, it feels hollow.  like binge-watching six seasons of game of thrones in one weekend... it was kinda fun a the time, but also anxiety provoking because you are say...  why the fuck am I doing this?
- A TRANSFORMATION STORY PROVIDES THE ANSWER -- when I can construct a story about how solving this problem will somehow transform things for some group for the better in a significant way, then have no such hollow feeling... it it jet-fuel to work even later into the night!
- SOCIAL -- One common and very satifying way for work to be transformative is for the work to be social in nature, figuring out how society can work better is inherently transformative and hard (if it were easy it would already be done!)
  
  
  INTERNALIZED
- NO PAPER NEEDED -- the very best problems are ones that can be considered for days or weeks without even needing a piece of paper -- just pure thinking.
- LESS LIBRARY RESEARCH -- I am ok needing to do some background learning in order to attack a problem.  Still this learning, unless it involves learning clever insights is a bit of needed drudgery work, it is not the main course.
- LESS COLLABORATIVE -- I am ok problem solving as part of a team, but I like moving fast, and I like the thrill of the solving itself, thus collaboration can be a bit of a speed bump for all of that.  It is ok, and can even be energizing when my partner is complementary and sharp/fast.
  
  
  CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM SOLVING
- PROBLEM FRAMING -- Often the most unconstrained (and thus hardest/cleverest) part of solving a problem is properly framing it in a way that it CAN be solved in a good way.  This is very satisfying work.
- EDGE OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL -- Often the at the fringes of what is known and what is properly framed is where the exciting action is at.  It is close enough in that one might make the transformative difference by properly framing the work, but it is not so far in that the proper framing is easily obtained.  Often this work is called "conceptualizing" a problem.  I freaking love it!
  
  
  MENTORING
- Advising
- Vision --
- Details & Tracking & Plodding -- not so much
  
  
  EXAMPLES OF DAN-WORK:
- BLOCKCHAIN - Building a POS block chain as robust as today's POW chains are
- ELDERBOT - Building an automated human-transport robot for the elderly
- TEAMSAVER - Identifying and overcoming limitations that make remote work less effective than in-person work
- ENGINES-OF-CONTROL - Building a conscious computer
- NANO-SCALE-PROGRAMMABLE-MATTER - How to build programmed 3D-nano structures
- AEOLUS-ROBOT-ARCHITECTURE - Designing the high-level APIs and architecture
  
  
  
  NEGATIVE EXAMPLES
- BORING DETAILS - I desperately want to hand off
- POLISHING - Polishing text describing an idea
- MEETINGS - Being in meetings once all the hard stuff is resolved
- TRACKING - Tracking work being done
  
  
  
  WHAT MIGHT FIT ME?
- BUSY BEE - helping with the framing & large scale solutioning across many hard tasks.
  
  
  _
#### . NINA WORK

HARD - Trying to prove theorems about privacy is very hard.
DELEGATE - Working with student means they do bulk of the tedious writeup.
EXPERT - Working near experts means that my work is efficient

_
#### . Conceptual Work

I am positively driven to think about
- the detailed conceptualization of a clever solution to a big-impact problem.
- Love just thinking, 
  
  
  DONT LOVE
- Don't love doing the library research
- I dread coordinating it.
- I resist doing it on a schedule, or for many hours at a time.
- I dread working on more boring parts.
- I dread working on parts where cleverness is not needed.
  
  _
#### . Technical center
Clear that my work must have a strongly technical center.
Possible centers:
- Applied ML reseracher
- Robotics project lead
- SOLVE -- dig into range of disparate problems and apply deep tech to them
- MENTOR -- Work as mentor to direct technical work to be done
  _
#### . Procrastination
- As soon as I work, I resort to procrastination by 
	organizing / processing easy stuff
- Emails, Medium/Blogs
- Take Nap (I physically feel sleepy in a quick way)
  _
#### . Uniform/Marcel
- IMPORTANCE -- feeling that the idea has potential for large impact
- UNIQUE -- feeling that idea that is not generally known, or solved
- PURE THOUGHT -- Struggling to understand/solve using pure thought
- 
- CLEVER SOLUTION --
- EFFICIENT SYSTEM -- love thinking about how to make systems efficient

>> How: Engaged; Energized

### 2022-04-19  Design - long distance commuter train, package delivery systems, 
### 2022-04-14  OBSIDIAN COMPLETIST 9&6


While feeling a bit lost & unmotivated with my outreach and DYL tasks, I feverishly completed multiple harder obsidian customzations and scripting:

- Did not want to quit while unexpectedly hard task was not working.
- Wanted to begin these tasks as soon as I understood what needed to be done.

### 2022-04-11  - Big city birthday party 

Hung out with parents at Big City birthday party.  Loved chatting tech, and just getting deep on topics.

- LOVE TALKING, ESPECIALLY IDEAS - I am often the last to go from these parties
- DIVE DEEP - Once I hit a topic of interest I will go deeper and longer than most anyone

### 2022-04-11  Scripting/configuring/tweaking my obsidian setup

LOVE
- GETTING K ORG JUST RIGHT - Love sweat the tiny details, and to think thru
- COMPLEXITY - Love to think thru the complex interactions to find an optimal set of choices.


- GRAVITATE -- When procrastinating on my projects I would dive headlong into fixing obsidian up
- COMPLETIST -- I feel great satisfaction when I get some feature fully working
- PROCESS EFFICIENCY -- I am very motivated to get details worked out in a way that simplifies / streamlines my own life
- 


Activity:  Hacking, Tweaking, Scripting, Configuring whatever it takes to 
Environment:  Working by myself, on my own time table
Interactions:  Working alone, not working with others
Objects:  
Users:  


### 2022-04-03  Organizational Systems - Tirelessly setup Obsidian & cleaned texts

### 2021-09-13 -- Writing up yet another idea (Alloy/crypto ownership)

Even as I am trying to really converge on which paths I will take, somehow I find myself thinking thru the details of yet another big idea.

This is really my M-O.  I am positively DRIVEN to think about:

-- yet another idea often focused on:
- Some big impact
- Solving some social-interactions problem
- A technically complex "clever" approach 
  -- My M-O is to simply think hard and at a detailed level about how one would approach all the various aspects of the problem in question.
  
  
  
  _
### 2021-09-03 -- WORK: happy to chat fast; but then hand details off to others
- I enjoyed figure out how to address NIO and Dropwater
- But got ansy after even just 30 min of writing it up.  
 	happier to hand off details
  
  
  _
### 2021-08-30 -- Inbox zero
- a goto activity for me is to read and process EASY emails
- want to switch away from any task when it gets harder except Uniform.
- like to execute easy quick tempo tasks for longer (emails, blogs, recipes)
- tend to want to swap tasks after 15min or so.  even doing this list was a bounce away from doing my three energy giving word maps.
  
  _
### 2021-08-30 -- Waste Time - Blog reading/responding - emails and tasks.
- These days I spend way too much time reading blogs.
- I spent hours giving my feedback to others that I read.
- I don't want huge followers, I am just compelled to engage once I have thought and have come to a conclusion about a subject.
  
  _
### 2021-08-26 -- Procrastinate
- When I get ready to work, I will procrastinate by doing many organizational tasks first:
- read emails
- read medium/blogs
- organize todo lists, do quick items
- do weekly tasks
- _
### 2021-08-26 -- Shelving / recipes
- I really like to organize things, spent hours designing and building shelving for ingredients, getting labels & containers.
- Spent many hours optomizing recipes so they would be time efficient to make.
- So time spent cooking is not valued by me, but time spent ORGANIZING to cook is compelling (even if not really so very fun)
  
  _
### 2021-06-00 -- QL modelling
- When QL came to me with several problems about how to model some aspect of self driving, I really found it fun to brainstorm how to attack the problem.
- I think for me the most fun part, is struggling to see the best way to attach the problem.
- I also like helping others to attack the problem, then not having to screw around with the details involved in actually implementing it.
  
  _
### 2021-06-00 -- QL Hacking
I also then helped out by coding several parts of the data analytics process in python.  This was also fun.  I think doing it all day would get tedious, but if that were <=25% of my time it would be ideal.

_
### 2021-07-25 -- Flighty Freddie
- While working on this activity log, I so badly want to jump to another activity.  (even a valuable one)  but the impulse is so fast that if I followed it, I would be jumping from one thing to the next is a very inefficient way.
  
  _
### 2016-00-00 -- Bizzy Robotics - Early days
I was naturally pulled into my work at Bizzy.  I was happy that in the evening I still was working on Uniform, but with Joe at the office, and with the CTO leadership role, I naturally fell into a pretty driven tempo.
- Worked on my "architecture" stuff too much.
- Didn't attend to impt aspects of leadership (lack of proclivity and skill)
- Gain value from being leader.
- GOOD: at relationship aspect of job.  good at vision and leadership.
- CORRECTABLE:  was too 'hot headed'.
- did not build regular handoff & check in processes
	  
  _
### 2021-07-22 -- Foxglove robotics development platform
Got excited thinking about the idea of making a robotics-dev-studio that is efficient for doing robotics development work.  In general I think I am really motivated and excited to think about making efficient-to-use tools and processes.


_
### 2021-07-21 -- Marcel response (flow)
When I saw marcel's note, I just could not help but to write my response.  Totally threw off my whole morning.  Immediately fought to load some needed open source (which I normally hate).  Each time I tried to work on something else, my brain kept going back to details about it.  really extremely hard for it to not just spontaneously break back into my thinking while on other topics.  Just gave up and wrote the reponse.

_
### 2019-00-00 -- Block Chain
Operated in flow for months trying to build a new block chain.
- The ideas seemed very big.  I imagine large impact.
- Lots of creativity borne from just thinking hard for hours solving hard technical sub-problems.
  
  _
### 2021-07-20 -- Jump jump jump**
When I am working on a thing that I am drawn to, I will push to work more and more hours.  Easily dropping other things I want/need to do.  When it is an activity that I resist, then I find it overwhelming to want to switch away from this thing.  Right now I am trying to do my Job matrix, and I want to switch away.  It stresses me to think about it.  and I am not quite sure what I should put down on it.

_
### 2021-07-19 -- Marcel response  -- couldn't stop writing it!**
I receieved his response email, and I immediately wanted to think thru my response.  Couldn't stop writing it up, until it was done.  Was willing to re-read and correct it -- even as I kinda hate doing that.

### 2021-07-19 -- Thinking while walking
When walking my mind repeatedly returns to details of Uniform, and how I might frame and say part of it.  Or less so, how I might resolve this or that techical detail

#### 2021-05-06 - WORK VIEW

Work is the technical building of value:
- OWNERSHIP --
	- BUILDING -- I am organized around the idea of _building_ things--BUILDING a THING that has tangible value for some 'customer' community
	- LEADERSHIP -- Having some vision/leadership scope fits best w/ my personality.
- TECHNICAL DEPTH -- Somewhere in my life there needs to be some hard problem solving going on.  Work is a very natural place to find this activity.
- IMPACT
	- JUSTIFICATION -- To myself and to others this output is central to my value.
	- WORTHWHILE - Work should move society forward.  Be a net gain.  The more people affected, the greater the gain.
	- MY PRIME OUTPUT -- For me, my "prime output" in life are the ideas that I realize, in both a technical and social sense.
	- VISION -- some dan-specific ideas are being executed
- ASPECTS:
	- INVENTING / BUILDING -- I spend my time 'inventing' things
	- SOCIAL SYSTEMS -- I am driven towards a kind of 'systems' thinking.
	- ORGANIZATIONAL / REPRESENTATIONAL -- I tend to think about org and rep
- SPRINT -- I am a sprinter, and am comefortable working intensly in a sprint, but I flag if doing admin/low-mental work for too many hours per month.
- MONEY & FREEDOM -- Money buys freedom from the drudgery of work that does not stem from innate desire to create.  Money supports the family, and allows me to go where interest dictates rather than where money is plentiful.
- FULFILLMENT - I am happiest when I am building/inventing.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
  	DETAILS
- TECHNICAL -- At times in my life when my job became more "management" I am driven to create side projects which are technical building.
- INVENT -- I am always 'inventing' things.  Thinking about the problems around me, and trying to see new ways to address them.  I stick with a few problems over many years, but I spend almost all of my time thinking thru solutions that I don't get feedback on, or try out in the world.
- SOCIAL SYSTEMS -- Many of my ideas are "social systems" or self-working process in nature.
- DETAILED DESIGN -- I am driven to think about the biggest of pictures, but then like to try to THINK THRU solutions down to pretty detailed levels.
	  
  	_
#### 2021-05-10 - LIFE VIEW

Why Are we here?
- **EXPERIENCES** -- _For the experiences we have_
  		Measured by the subjective value we attach both at the time and after
- **CONTRIBUTIONS** -- _For the contributions we make_
  		Being part of, giving to, & receiving from others within a society we build
- **GROWTH** -- _For the growth we undergo_
  		To grow in faith, wisdom, and understanding
	  
  	What is Meaning/Purpose of life?
- First, it is an adopted/constructed thing, but that fact should not and does not reduce its validity or importance.
- For me, the "why are we here" goals are ends unto themselves
	  
  	Relation To Others
- In the most important sense, we are peers of all others.
- And building/living a relation with them is central to life.
	  
  	Good & Evil
- Good is moving towards and living our purpose
- Evil is moving away or destroying our purpose, or doing that to another
	  
  	Higher Power
- I live my life beliving there is a higher power, though I will likely never know this with certainty.
	  
  	Role of joy, sorrow, justice, injustice, love, peace, and strife in life?
- These are the backdrop of experiences, contributions, and growth.
