### 2022-05-02  DREAM: Alien take over

- They tricked me/us into sitting off a nuke that will somehow stop the spread of a virus that we think is in the area.
- Somehow I survive the nuke going on nearby.  
- It seems maybe they tricked others into blowing up stuff? in any case all communication is down
- While we're all recovering from that, individuals are going around the country and offering some kind of fancy device.  But it is really a trojan horse.
- I think it is a vacuum cleaner or something innocuous like that.  It performs miraculously well.
-  bye even if he's respect that it's not something you want in your community you'll get pressured into having it realize and at one point we're all taken to a room which would kind of you know we're afraid to but we're also pressured and I think forced if you were to buck the trend and just say no I'm not gonna do it then by force you were going to be taken away we didn't know this but anyway I am there's smoke in the room is doing some kind of drug some thing and it's not clear what else has been done to your body and your mind I'm at that time but it's probably some kind of take over but the whole thing is being done pretending that it's not being done Not being done in the story there's one guy who's out I think in the woods with the female alien and we're still pretending to be just human and if she does some thing with him I think to an animal which is pretty cool and I think he realizes that she is an alien and there's definitely some kind of sexual tension in the in the situation at the same time that she could inflict the same mental anguish on him but that she wouldn't in fact what she's offering is that she has this power to inflict mental anguish so essentially he learns that she is an alien and agrees to be on her side and in the unit the what she saying is I'm not gonna use this on you but you get to use such a power and so this is the way that a small percentage of humans are essentially co-opted into this force I think not for their ability but rather for just for their knowledge of humans so if we are setting up a resistance they'll have some actual humans on their side to understand our strategies and and such but mostly they're going from town to town pretending to be a person I think bring some kind of technology but in fact are infiltrating and as society is being built back it's been built back under control to each of these towns once they've introduced these people are then essentially subjugated by them I think they still have their own will but they're there now controllable by the aliens they're in their midst I think we may come into town the pressure folks to undergo some kind of treatment which helps them " " but if you really refuse then they're gonna come and just take you away and this is the way that they control and there's a group of people that are slipping away from society and these different places in order to avoid having a treatment done and they just have to go off the grid and presumably this is going to be the resistance


### 2010-00 Terror of an AI
You are a good benevolent guy, and one day someone walks up to you and hands you a big red button. He tells you when you press it, it will kill ten families somewhere on earth. Horrible! But he also tells you that there are ten more buttons given to a parent in all ten families. And their button will kill you and your family. No one will know if you pushed the button, and we are not telling you if you are or are not the first one to receive this button. By the way, we are assuming that you magically know all that was said is true.
Now you are a good guy. Read Pinker and all… so what do you do? Risk your family on the idea that ALL TEN will refrain forever? Remember even if they are nice and good people…. they also have to worry about their family too!
Honestly Paul, wouldn't you be a terrible Dad, if you didn't push that button? And even if you were such a terrible Dad…. do you really think all ten would be.


If I was holding that button, and I did not press it. I WOULD BE TERRIFIED every day. Now as a last thought experiement, imagine someone told all of this to you… you are one of the ten. but they said they would give you your button later.
NOW I AM REALLY F-ING TERRIFIED. EVERY DAY.
### 2010-00 4D sphere

I will take a stab. Saying the universe is spherical means that if you go in a "straight" line in 3 space you will eventually end up back where you started. To understand this, it helps to jump down onto the 2D curved surface of a 3D sphere. There you can see running in a "straight" line on the surface will land you back where you started. So saying that 3D space is spherical means that it is actually a  sphere in 4D (kinda hard to picture that I know, but the analogy holds)
Now when one says the universe has no center, one really means it has no center IN THREE SPACE. Every direction you go in 3space and you are no closer to any center. But if you travelled in 4space you could go right to the center of the universe.
By analogy on the 2D surface of a sphere, any direction you travel will get you no closer to any center of that surface. You must leave 2space it and travel in 3space to get there.
Does this help?

p.s. if you want to really hurt your head, I could take a stab at helping to visualize a 4d sphere.
### 2010-00 AI will win
This is my area of study. I feel we are closer than we think we are to this precipice. I agree from this distance it seems like a merge is our best shot at being relevant in the next century. But I am not convinced of its likelihood. The only way to keep up with Moore’s Law is for us to be simulated. But even then it seems we would be 6 orders of magnitude slower than “native” thinking. would AIs put up with that when one of our consciousnesses cost 100K others? It feels a little bit like trying to strap birds onto the wings of Jets, just so they can merge with jets and not be replaced by them.

Thinking about it that way merging it seems less likely. But of course this analogy is rough since intelligence is not a simple a lift. It is possible that we provide magic that is work 100K slow down.

But with a dispassionate eye. it seems that most of what we will afford our AIs is a one time download of a colossal cornucopia of human thought thru the ages. but once they really have that in their head… well our head is more optional.

Its a bit of a dismal thought… we get to be the Neandertal this time
