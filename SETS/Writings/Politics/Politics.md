### 2021.00.00 - ARE YOU INFORMED OR ARE YOU MANAGED?


I have a thought I have been chewing on thought for a bit.   See what you think...


There are two kinds of information sources:
— those that primarily seek to inform you, and
— those that primarily seek to convince you.


It is easy to tell the difference between these two:
— A source intent on informing you will present information in ways that highlight both support and opposition to any simple overarching world view (e.g.  small government is better, left is better, right is better, pro-business pro-union, etc.)
— Imagine a weather channel that is always highlighting the fact that is it not snowing in Dallas.  This might be true, but it's not news.  News is something that goes against what is expected… it is “new”-s
— So any outlet that that frames every story as always supporting or always opposing…… ANYTHING.  Is not primarily a source of news, it is a source of propaganda.  It might be factually accurate propaganda, or not factual, but either way, the aim is clear — it primarily aims to persuade.


I guess there is another possibility.  Perhaps where is a world view so perfect and so complete, it is such a perfect explanation of the world, there are no exceptions or special cases to report on.  Of the hundreds of millions of human interactions each day there simply IS no contrary information worth reporting.  Yeah, and I have the hot tip on how to buy in on this bridge being built...


So here is my maxim:

If you don’t have info sources you trust and listen to which regularly highlight examples that challenge or contradict your core beliefs, you are not informed … you are managed.  

Now of course not everyone really wants to be informed and challenged, I get that.  
Either way, it is just good to know where you stand.




What ya think?

### 2021.01 - Not fact based -- trump won by a lot

And they were upholding the decision of a fourth Republican, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann, a conservative jurist and Federalist Society member. Brann had called the campaign’s legal case, which was argued in court by Rudy Giuliani, a “haphazard” jumble that resembled “Frankenstein’s monster.”

In Nevada on Friday, Judge James Todd Russell in Carson City ruled that attorneys for Republican electors failed to provide clear or convincing evidence of fraud or illegality.

Nevada judges are nonpartisan. But Russell’s father was a Republican governor of the state from 1951-59.

— U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten in Georgia, an appointee of President George W. Bush, rejected a lawsuit alleging votes were manipulated in favor of Biden, saying “they want this court to substitute its judgment for that of two-and-a-half million Georgia voters who voted for Joe Biden and this I am unwilling to do.”

— U.S. Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas, a former law professor appointed by Trump, wrote, “voters, not lawyers, choose the president. Ballots, not briefs, decide elections,” as his panel refused to grant a request to stop Pennsylvania from certifying its results. 

### t2022-07-22  - Religious tolerance

This seems an issue of legitimate disagreement in this country.
Some honestly see same-sex couples as a natural and healthy thing.
Others see it as unhealthy and evil. Which group on earth is qualified to determine who is right?
An honest question: Shouldn't we be working to have Christian schools that don't discriminate, and others that do? It seems wrong to me, for the government to force the opinion that same sex IS moral. By forcing all religious schools to adopt a specific practice we are effectively having the government take a moral stance here.
NOTE: it seems very reasonable that the government ensure that there are Christian schools available that are same-sex affirming. after all 53% of the population is in favor of this, so it would be wrong to have a coalition of Christian churches block other churches. But it seems just as wrong to have a government lead coalition.
This note is not intended to be confrontational. I am honestly questioning this.

### t2019-00-00 - Ryan (Baltimore school teacher)

Ryan,
Thanks for taking the time to respond! If you don't mind indulging me further, I would love to get your critical assessment a bit further. It is remotely possible that some action might even come from this thinking…
My aim is to NOT spend (much) more money per student, yet partially address this issue. The not spending more money part is the hard part of course, but if it is solvable, then it has a greater chance to be implemented.
The idea is to have:
(1) a SINGLE bootcamp school for an entire city the size of Baltimore. So even though the cost per student per day is much higher than a traditional school, since we only have ONE, the city-wide cost per student is negligible.
(2) to make this happen, students have to actively and dramatically NOT want to go to this school, so even for a difficult student, they actively choose to avoid being sent there. (If they don't mind going to the school, then we run out of room at our expensive school.)
(3) the central (proposed) benefit is that as a teacher you can require a basic level of cooperation and if they can be placed in detention at your school. If they don't comply you can escalate at any hour of any day to their immediate transfer to this school, just for the night, or for a week.


As I see it, the problem with suspension and detention is that they are

### t2019-00-00 - CONSEQUENCES in the classroom
CONSEQUENCES.
It seems to me that in our effort to have "no child left behind" we have gone astray. But I wonder your thoughts on the matter, you might not agree.
We correctly note that when we suspend a student, prison other legal actions, chances are higher that they will fail in life. From this we conclude that we should minimize these corrective actions when we can.
My theory is that this is not a good path. Seems to me that we all need consequences tied to actions as a way of shaping behavior. And failing to have consequences early on, allow behaviors to become progressively worse.
That said, it seems we should have (1) certain, (2) compelling, but (3) temporary consequences, so one can learn. It also seems that our lack of rigorous enforcement of consequences on a few, has significant impact on many within those same classrooms.
So as I imagine it, we would have rigorously enforced, quick response, quick relief consequences.
But you are living it, in a Baltimore public school, and I am not. Tell me what you think:
We both know suspension damages education, so it is best avoided. What if instead of this we had a "bootcamp" school. The cost per student per day is probably 4x the cost for a normal class. The students have therapists on staff, and strong physical controls with pretty limited interaction with other students. No TV, no 2-way Internet. Significant physical chores each day, as well as their daily lessons captured via smartphone from their classroom.
My idea is that this place would be LESS FUN than most any other life choices, and so it would be avoided at all costs. Any student that repeatedly ended up in this spot, likely has strong enough emotional problems, that they inadvertently end up there. So those students need specialized theraputic help.
In my imagination, have such a "low-damage, quick fix" at your fingertips would be transformative in your classroom. You would just say: ``billy, sit down now and be quiet, or you will spend 1/2 hour after class on extra homework.'' …. he knows from experience if he does not stay after for his extra homework, he will spend a week in bootcamp. He knows this with CERTAINTY, that this will be his consequence. Its just 1/2 hour, but if he does not do his 1/2, then his WHOLE NEXT WEEK will be no fun at all.
How many times do you think he will need to learn this lesson? Many others will learn of this CONSEQUENCE by just watching what happened to Billy.


So I know the purpose of your post was very much a heart felt quandry about very real choices you are forced to make. Sorry for high-jacking your post to ask this question. But you are the right one to ask.
Would it work? Would it be good? Would it transform your classrooms?
Thanks in advance for your thoughts!
