FERMI RESPONSE -- They are out there but galactic law requires leaving us alone.

HOW GALACTIC LAW CAME TO BE



THE ALPHA & BETA CIVILIZATIONS 
INCEPTION - The first civilizations developed randomly thousands of light years apart with billions of stars between them.  Each achieved space flight and their first 1000+ solar system expansions in isolation, wondering if they are alone in the universe.
CONTACT - When one civilization first detects another it is most likely the alpha civilization the one who has made more solar expansions than the other beta civilization.  But either way it will either be a peer or dominated contact
	PEER CONTACT - A peer contact is between two civilizations where the alpha civilization is no more than 10x more expansions than the beta civilization, as well as similar levels of technological development.  The key property of a peer contact is that it is not clear which civilization would win the race to out populate or out-annihilate the other.
	DOMINATED CONTACT - By contract a dominated contact occurs when it is clear which civilization would 'win' the race to out populate or annihilate the other.

SURVIVAL INSTINCT - The alpha civilization will want to ensure its continued survival as it members have been shaped by evolutionary forces thru its creation. so whatever path is chooses should ensure this.





LIMITED EXPANSION FROM OF PEER CONTACT - In the case of a peer contact the limited commercial value of galactic domination is not worth the risk of annihilation from loosing a battle for dominance. Thus the limited expansion pact below is adopted.

LIMITED EXPANSION FROM FROM DOMINATED CONTACT - In the case of a dominated contact the alpha civilization may wish to perpetually maintain its dominant position, but not wish for galactic homogeneity.  In that case it would place a

NON-DOMINATION 

We assume either the first conacts were non dominating contacts, or the dominating civilization found the notion of a fully dominated galazy where their civilization maximizes its use of every viable star within the galazy.

LIMITED EXPANSION PACT - In either contact scenario above the alpha civilization will require hard expansion limits for the beta civilization.  They could simply try to wipe them out, but this would be difficult and un-needed



	- FIRST STAR SYSTEMS - The first star systems all evolved their first life sustaining planets at roughly the same time, and those planets cooled and evolved into life sustaining planets also roughly at the same time.
	- 100 MILLINON YEAR WINDOW - Thus those with first mover advantage all began their evolutionary processes within 100 million years of each other, and those first movers that achieve space flight were all the

SPEED OF LIGHT - 

FINITE PHYSICS - Hundreds, Thousands or Millions of years of technological development from now will yield a set of physical laws which afford confidence that no new laws will be discovered that admit radically more powerful weapons.  There may be learning that continues, but it is limited in scope enough to provide very strong confidence in these advance civilizations that no radically new surprises are yet still on the horizon.  We cannot prove this to be the case, but it is plausibly the case, and it is required for the overall galactic trajectory we are proposing, so we call out the assumption explicitly.


LIMITED COMMERCIAL VALUE OF EXPANSION - There maybe knowledge, computation, prestige, and other soft benefits for solar expansion, but direct commercial value is not among these benefits.   The cost of transport for physical good is too allow for productive physical commerce between star systems.  Even computational commerce is quite limited because of the large time lags involved.  Only colossal 'batch' processing of existential questions could make sense in this context.  Thus we assume when solar expansion occurs it is not for the direct commercial benefit of the instigating civilization's citizens.


SOLAR DOMINANCE - Whatever civilization first dominates a solar system can use that dominance to maintain its status in perpetuity.

- ENERGY DOMINANCE - Within each solar system the sun of that system is the source of nearly all available energy within that system.  Further since large scale harvesting of that energy is impossible to hide, and easy to disrupt,  the first civilization to achieve clear dominance in solar energy extraction is nearly impossible to dislodge from within the system.  It's available energy to attack is far superior to any adversary, who is unable to deploy sufficient energy collection to mount a counter attack from within the solar system.
