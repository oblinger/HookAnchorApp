- Sitting on it vs. a new Leap v2.  (more spring/thicker from 1/2")
- Steel case is not listed as a 24/7 chair, but as an Ergo chair
- When will it arrive?


- Tension knob on back for leap v2
- best to buy directly from steel case

- Low back pain.
- Seem to do best with aggressive, low lumbar support
- Often cannot get my chair to go low enough (with no shoes on and rollerblade wheels)
- What are the best possible chairs for this?

$570 -- Leap V2.  
Nutral posture 8000 series.  17"  3" cynlider

### 2022-03-21  Home Depot - replace new GE microwave

      **WD95991116**  I purchased a GE microwave less than 30 days ago.  It was installed by Home Depot's 3rd party vendors, and it mostly works.  But every 4-5 days all of its LEDs will light up briefly, and then it resets itself, and needs the clock reset as if it is the first time it is powered up.  No other appliance in the house is having power issues.  I would like to have the microwave replaced with a fully functioning one.  Thanks.

Subject: Poor warrantee service by Nana Home Services

I expect more from GE.  You should reconsider your relationship with Nana Home Services.
I am having an issue with my new GE microwave, and you dispatched Nana to take a look, after some initial confusion (that I think was GE's fault)  the technician had a valid work order.  They use a web app and text messages to coordinate the worker's visit.  But something is very broken with their work flow.  Twice I received *confirmation* text messages asserting that my visit was scheduled, and thus I rearranged schedules in order to be available for the window in which the work is occurring.  TWICE I simply received a message requesting confirmation of a different time.  No explanation of what has happened, no phone call.  Just a new scheduling.

On the third time I was getting this scheduled, I grew frustrated and requested to talk with someone at Nana.  It seems they are too busy for this.  Carmela "thanked me for reaching out" and just told me "be a good little boy and please respond to the third scheduling by their Technician Edmar Michael"

Wow!  I don't allow others to treat my time as so irrelevant.  For me it is precious.

I will think twice or thrice before purchasing another GE appliance.  You should think twice about Nana.

### 2016-00-00 - Aeolus notes

picker/sweeper
 close doors
 hazzards (avoid spill, poop)
 animate tracking
 safety stuff done



RECO
 -- better/faster pose/reco
 -- fit onto a TX-1
 -- door knobs
 -- reco of special non-ridgids: e.g. poop, power cord, liquid
 -- Animate detection


 -- reco for grasping.






         INT:  Pos Ctlr
Roj      INT:  Arm Accuracy Test
Milutin

-- amazon:  pill box, laptop cord; bead cover; endust

-- how do we catch up to based on lossages.
-- what will be deliver by end of month.
-- how will we avoid having this kind of gap in the future.



fix phone calendar to include aeolus events
GOLD ROOM -- confluence setup for base ports etc.
gold owner
git owner
place where the test is run. where are the camera.

Hiring
-- ONE OF A KIND:  Security, SafetyTeam, Mgt guys.  in Europe.
-- Q/A, sys eng, integration team
-- Roboticsts
-- Vision guys
-- Hiring team.
Notes
Less 

Rough guess new job 25% less.
After all deductions then is only 10% lower than Aeolus
Benefits that more than make up for this:  
-- unemployement insurance
-- retirement benefit.  plus a lump sum. <<
-- paid health insurance  <<

-- paid vacation
-- 1-month of "extra salary"

Not so easy to find companies that pay full benefits -- with a reasonable pay.

.....
was Thinking about the future.
did not seem so worried about us being a startup
did want to work as a C++ but that is not the primary.
was frustraed with himself that he couldn't get others to support him as he needed to get work done fast
......





Dont have base driveing; dont have object reco; dont have arm transforms and arm calibrated well enough for use.

DEMO PRIORITIES -- should focus on demos in this order
(1) Stuffy Bump
(2) Base explore
(3) Collision Avoidance
(4) Grab vac pole



BASE IDEAS
-- Can we move Felipe move to 100% supporting base sensor integration?
-- Could planning team members help with travelling salesman debugging in base?   (Balasz?)

COLLISION AVOIDANCE IDEAS
-- Woitech could support 3D occupancy work for base demo
-- Could move Filip, Mulutin  to collision avoidance (or Slawomir Maybe)?   this could free up Sahil, but could damage collision avoidance.
-- Jose works 100% supporting demos (perhaps collsion avoidance?)   (we think he is almost 100% now)

OBJECT RECO IDEAS
-- Theo: maybe work fulltime on Reco, and achieve max velocity getting reco on stuffies
-- James Chou could work directly w. MIT to get object reco working in Taiwan (skipping SF step)



 



#### Todos
-- Tell Rafael to call Alex.  resign
-- DECIDE:  w. Brandon are they sending the correct 
-- DECIDE:  Rogerio to Taiwan?
-- People Slide:  Name Education Location Lane specialty (tagline)
-- After Action:  After action post mortum.
-- When do we get Alpha platform tests
-- Mocking the GEE for unit testing.  talk w. Filepe, alexeyz
-- ask brandon would Dung be better in taiwan
-- list of employees (including contractors)
   split by AI / vision / robotics, etc.   also list swim lane
-- Check: do we have good patent coverage for Patient for N^2     

CTO
-- build org
-- road map
-- shooting the moon.
   build robot medical system.... whole system is robotic... and see the way.

#### After Action
-- Need reliable way to contact people.  Brandon while walking around.

-- VPN -- one person being the gateway & need second person access -- temporary access


#### Jeff Roles

-- Organizational/cleanliness tracking (JIRA, swim lane plans, repo, )
-- Rescource planning  #people, #months, across tasks.

-- Performance reviews
-- Scheduling meetings, 

#### After Action

EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY TO TAIWAN
-- Certain time we are not getting responsivness.
-- Other times we are sending slack / JIRA request, but no response
   thinking that receiver is not sure what to do, so does nothing
   --> Tasking priority is not clear.
-- Responsiveness must be significantly upgraded.  (these are early days but...)

-- More Testing should be driven from Taiwan

I need to resolve three issues w. experian. I know I must do it myself for security. that is ok, I just want you to find out exactly what I need to do.

(1) I want to remove my email experian@oblinger.us from their DB. I do not want any emails there
(2) I want to remove my credit card from their systems, I don't want them having ongoing access to it.
(3) They are claiming that I owe for some service which I never signed up for, I want to delete any on ongoing services.
(4) I have a security freeze in place. I do want to keep that freeze in place. 

How do I do these things?

thanks!
